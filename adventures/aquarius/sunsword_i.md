## 29/5/800 {#section .unnumbered}

Hired by Sebastian of Hamburg, to find the Sun Sword from the Sun Empire
on the plane of Aquerius. This is supposedly a sword made from pure
sunlight, it also has an individual true name. Spend the day getting
ready. Flamis sells 2x rk 10 weapons of flame, Callas sells 4x rk 5
trollskin to party funds.

Then thru Rune portal to Grenada to see Cornelius for magic loot. Waters
of Str(4), Healing(12), and restoratives(4). Rune of protection and luck
each. Loaned an amulet of Calcedony and Iron each. I Divinate the staff
which activates planer gate obelisk. He also says that some creatures
will pull you into a different time-frame, they must be killed to return
to \"normal\" time. Sleep. Leave east to Valencia. Sleep at an Inn, next
day head to hills. Make camp at foot hills. Ride thru river pass to
Stone Circle. Teleport to Aquerius Temple, each member loses 10 FT,
which wraps, per use of the portal. To close to night (undead
activating) so we go back, and try tomorrow.

Portal in a couple of hours after dawn. Find the sanctified hill, and
head NW out of city. Find a house to hole up, then notice that 4
Bonegolems were shambling after us (seem to be weakly following our
\"life trail\"), we lure them to an orchard, and set it alight which
burns them, but some flaming humans appear which also try to pursue us.
One runs up to Christopher and explodes doing 29 damage, we shoot the
rest from range. Retire to farm and rest up. That night during first
watch, we get attacked by a dire wolf(Mind mage) and a dozen dogs, slay
them all. Sleep.

Need to search Imperial Palace, Forum (for senate), and Temple. Recon
for the day. Sitting in the tower we notice that bones/corpses slowly
start pulling together, sunlight slows rate of accretion, full dark
probably very quick. Smashing them before they animate seems to work. I
divinate \"the city\" -

-   area is Damned
-   people who die have their souls trapped, as more people were killed,
    city became worse
-   lifeforce, fire etc act as loadstones to the spirits, this allows
    them to manifest physically

We check out the Holy hill, and partly clear/repair the road from the
gate to there. The grass seems to differentiate the sanctified bit.
Divination revels -

-   consecrated ground (to \"God\"), +50 MR
-   all undead must make MR to be on it, then willpower to stay in area
    (also same for demons)
-   aura strength indicates done by human or long-lived sentient.

Search the town a little. Find a ghost in a cellar, probably owner of
house, who speaks elvish -

-   Titus Leanius Victor was the last emperor, who went to western
    continent on campaign and never returned
-   seems like an anarchy uprising later occurred against the nobles
    (killed on Hanging Hill), a short time later the senate was burned
    by looters
-   there might still be a library in the Forum
-   The 12 Tribes fled and left the land
-   the elves left a long time ago, but are rumoured to return sometime
-   when asked about the Holy hill, says he doesn't know, but a short
    time back there was a \"short night\"

Ghost wants to die, so kill him. Do a runner from the city, and rest
up.  Next day head back. The road we cleared still looks fine, then go
to stone circle, and portal back to Alusia.

Report to Cornelius 7/6/800.
