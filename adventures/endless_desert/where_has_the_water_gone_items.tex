\begin{ep-box}{Ever burning torch}

This small touch is about a foot long and weighs around 1lb.  It is
basically a carved stick of wood with some black sticky canvas wrapped
around one end.  It can be light with any normal fire (or simple fire
cantrip such as fire finger) and can be put out by dousing in water.
There is a 90\% chance lighting or extinguishing the touch will work,
will a roll of 00 causing the magic to be destroyed.  The touch is
permanantly fireproofed but pulling the canvas off the stick will ruin
the magic.

The light is fairly poor, casting poor shadows and illuminating about
a megahex.  The fire also gives off heat and can be used to cook, taking
about half an hour to bring one pint of water to boiling.

\begin{ep-box}{Necklace of Pearls}

This fine silver necklace currently has seven coloured pearls attached
to it.  The necklace itself is worth 100 silver pennies and is not
enchanted.  If a pearl is detached from the necklace it will explode
five seconds later.  Detaching the pearl is equivilent to a five foot
step so it can be combined with any normal action (e.g.\ a throw,
insert into a door lock, fire in a sling etc\.).  The pearls are not
replacable.

\begin{description}
\item[Red Pearl] This pearl will explode covering a hex in flames.
The fire does not produce a presure wave and the fire does not splash.
It does 5d10 damage (if roll is 10, then reroll and add).
Fireproofing halves damage and Protection from Magic Fire works and
armour reduces damage.

\item[Blue Pearl]
This pearl will explode covering a single target in acid.  It does
5d10 damage (if roll is 10, then reroll and add).  Armour reduces
the damage by double.
Water (Acid).

\item[White Pearl] This pearl will explode is shards of ice, creating
5 ice projectiles which will hit the five closest targets, each doing
2d10 damage each with Armour reducing the damage.

\item[Smokey Pearl] This pearl will explode into a thick black smoke
which will immediately cover a megamegahex.  The smoke will stay for
4d5 pulses before being dispersing normally.

\item[Yellow Pearl] This pearl will explode in a blinding flash of
light.  Anybody (or anything) not facing directly away from the
explosion and within 50' will be blinked for 2d5 pulses.

\item[Clear Pearl] This pearl will explode into a ball of electricity
and will arc to any target with a megahex causing them 3d10 damage
(with rollups).  Armour will reduce damage, unless it is metal, in
which case it will multiply the damage by 50\% extra.

\item[Black Pearl] This pearl will explode in a pressure wave.  In an
open space it cause anything in the immediate hex to take 2d10 damage
(with rollups) with Armour reducing damage.  However in a closed space
(less than a cubic foot) it will do 5d10 damage.  In a closed space
smaller than a cubic inch it will do 10d10 damage.
