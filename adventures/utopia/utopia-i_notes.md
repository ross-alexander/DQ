Employer

The Job
: Kill some lizards and sacrifice them

Not sure about the worlds, its safe for people to turn up
to. Populated by big dinos, giant insects and large reptiles. Want to
hunt down some lizards and create a graveyard. Its in a new world,
think its real but not sure. There is a ritual that will send us
through, they can detect the graveyard. Working for a power called
Ankh, the Lord of the Grave. A powerful god in another world. This
will allow him to manifest a presence.

Limitations of the bodies

- No magic
- Not very dexterous
 
- Stone or wooden weapons
- Make leather armour
- Iron weapons will degrade

The will help them get back souls that have been borrowed unlawfully.

When are we ex
- Bags
- Food
- Shovel
- Simple tools
- Rope
- Poisons (natural)
- Pitch and tar to stop bleeding
- Net
 
- This is someone elses world, so they need this to be unnoticed.
- No sentients in the world
- Perform a crude ritual to connect to

Head down to Lacroix Enterprises in Seagate Old Town, close to the
S-mart. Three sorties. On the ground they sell alcohol.  Closed, but
the door is unlocked. Large crows waiting for us. Black sleek
(Stiletto), 2 is fat and looks like he cant fly (Leatherhead).

Little, quick. Big, slow. Medium. Green, Gray, yellow

Need to head to the graveyard up north.

Cant look throught so sending “people” through, that get killed, and
they pull them back via graveyard.

They think theres a lot of mud/forests there.

Managed to get the location down to one place that isn’t lethal.

If we die he can probably bring us back.

The better the graveyard we build, the better we get.

They explain the process to ritual of the graveyard.

Primordial world

Getting back; die, get enough done they can pull us via the place of
power, if its big enough the necromantic power will not kill us.

They can send a rock through with a message.

Take the boat the next day, takes us up the coast. 1 day Sanctuary, 1
day south end, 1 days fenarg swamp. 2 more days up river.

A small abandoned town on river up on the way to Innesburg.

Head into a house, looks almost fallen down. Internally the interior
is repaired, the outside is a disguise.

Head through the gate and find ourselves at the stone henge type
place. Beautifully carved monoliths covered in runes.

Vision beyond the ring is blurry, The sun shows we are a few hundred
miles from the village. Very calm and peaceful here

There are some dead lizards here

## Day 1 (10.8.823 WK)

Step through a portal, end up on a high cliff with water below. Temperate forest

Some time in the afternoon, the sun is warm

From cliff, wide bay, swamp beyond that.

Follow cliff edge ½ mile, five a rocks stream with slow
current. Follow the steam upstream, it’s a gentle slope through the
forest.

Hang up mundane stuff to speed us up and continue on with the food

- Swamp
- jungle
- forest
- volcano
 
Find a defensible cave, but it has lizard tracks outside. Small amount
of low light and infrared
 
Magical training
 - Teaching of spells and rituals in any of entities except greater summoning
Can provide money or investments
 

Combat – five lizards

Collect wood and burn bodies spend the day doing this

Mostly bipedal.

Very dark, no moon and a bit of light from the distance.

## Day 2

Clouds and rain the next day, poor visibility.  Hunt for herbs in the
woods to help with Turds infection

Collect up bones and carve on them in the evening, we can only carve
on the large bones as we are using our claws.

## Day 3

Good weather, breezy. Clear skies

Infection still present
 
- W – forest
- S – swamp
- NE – ice peaks
- SE – thick, green jungle
- SEE – Large volcano with discoloration around it
- NE – mountains in the way
 
Head around the mountain via the jungle, moving about a mile an hour, moving around the southern part of the mountain.
NE – two wide river and upland valley. Large herbivores grazing there, big multi-hex creatures

A few miles between the rivers
 
Head to the Savanah. Copse of tree and low scrubby land between
then. Large dinosaurs roaming the land (9 hex)

Uplands – planes and grass – Triceratops, packs of velociraptors

Have not seen any large predators

We decide to set fire to the forests

Decide to set the forest on fire, head back to the cave. Get there late in the evening.
 
Stack firewood up outside, get some herbs and food. Build hide across
the cave enterance. Find a lee under a rock to shelter in the snow.

## Days 4 - 7

Set fire, the wind goes unfavorably for us. Uzi and Mayhem get badly
burnt. Hide in the snow until is cools, we head down to the cave. U
and M rest while we T guards.

## Day 8

Stay in cave. Mayhem is infected, spent the day recovering. 

## Day 9

Start searching for bones. Bones of large Iguana. 7 adults and 9
smaller ones
 
 Despite the ash and smoke in the sky we can see a flock of pterodactyl
riding the thermals, they are coming in to steal the bodies.  They fly
down to attack, the part form a wedge, a total of 7 small ones and 2
large ones. We kill most of them and one large one escapes. Turf is
injured and spends the next eight days resting while the others scour
the area for bodies. We spend the time eating pterodactyl, and discuss
the need for regular supplies as the food from here.

## Days 10 - 17

Over the next eight days Mayhem and Uzi collect bones while Turd rests up to recover from him wounds. We then cast the ritual turning the cave into a graveyard, and we they block it up. 

Uzi channels his ventriloquism through the bones. About ½ days later a shield emerges through the rock, but has now survived the journey. It is aged and warped, and they herbs we requested are gray dust. We clearly need a larger graveyard to strengthen the connection.We find an alternative cave to camp in. 

The summary of areas;
- Uplands - large creatures. 
- Scrub - velociraptors

## Day 18

We decide to head to the jungle to look for food and scout it out. Teak forests.
 
About 5 miles Looking from a ridge down to the rainforest, which
eventually heads out to the sea. Head down into the jungle, the sun is
obscured by the tree canopy and we are trudging through think vines.

Spot webs and grubs. Sign of dinosaur or lizard tracks, large dog or
humanoid size. Getting back will be much quicker as we have beaten a
track through the jungle.

Just after midday a large anaconda drops onto Turf, large enough to
swallow him. We quickly rip it apart.  Spot some rubber trees but are
a source for oils. We discuss weaponising it, but it will be tricky
without an alchemist and lab.

We head on back to our cave and have snake for dinner,


## Day 19

Head back down into the jungle and Mayhem leads the way. He stumbles
upon a nest of velociraptor and back away.  We follow their tracks
away from the nest and ambush four of them. They have five attacks
each, so Mayhem evades. Uzi forgets to evade and gets gutted.

Take raptor and Uzis body back to the new cave and examining the
Raptor body.

## Day 20

Head to the cave graveyard and attempted to send the body back. While
in the graveyard there is a tiny amount of mana. Can use DA, the
strength is slightly above tenuous. DA works and witchsight is working
in a limited fashion.

Camp at night and lay an ambush for the following morning. Group of 5
go by (to big) and another 3 (we can’t catch up). We head to the camp
and we cant get a good view in.

Sees a large raptor, about 50% bigger than the other, and two other
normal sized raptors.

Spend most of the day lurking and we ambush the three when they come
back in the falling light. Its too dark to get back so we drag the
bodies off the path and sleep there for the night.

A group of 5 raptors are moving near us, its very early in the
morning, the sun is just coming up.  We distract them and kill one,
they hide. They find us, we evade and manage to kill them.

Mayhem head to the camp and can see three (excluding the big one). Can
see three, things there are between 4-6 in the camp.

We stalk the camp, but none of them leave.

## Day 21

Sleep near the nest, That morning. One of the raptor is scouting
around, Mayhem follows it for a while but it spots him. It makes a
break and Turf intercepts it and hits.

Spend the rest of the day and take the bodies back to the cave, and
add them to the graveyard.

Uzis body appears in the graveyard; Ravens eventually resurrect Uzi
and they have a talk. He appears in the morning send him back with

- Shields! 3 kite + 2 medium. (lose an additional 1 MD as are heavy wooden shields). 
- New set of armour, 4 pt and -4 ag.
- Stone Claymore. Hits hard but is fragile.

Strip and mark the bones 

## Day 22

Windswept day. Head back to the jungle and Mayhem sneaks close and
observes. They have pulled up the flooring of the next and have made a
primitive wall around the nest.

Set fire to the outer wall, and two raptors charge out to attack. The
third one charges out behind them, its 50% larger. It takes Turf down
but the others evade a lot and kill them with reposts. The wounded
party head on back and rest up.
 
## Day 24 - 28

After four day Turf recovers and heals himself (talent twice) 

## Day 29

12 eggs in the nest. Turf and Uzi spend all day pulling back bodies. 

## Day 30 
Stip bodies and mark up bones. (talent once)

## Day 31 

A lizard's body turns up near the cave with the message “Good Enough
come back” Back in the graveyard. We are reverted back. They were
happy enough

The next part is to send sneaky people back to the same plane, at a
much later time, and find out whats happened and incite violence.
