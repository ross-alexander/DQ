\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept conjures to this plane a spectral warrior, and directs the
warrior to hunt down and slay one target, who must be within sight
when the spell is cast.  The warrior is completely insubstantial and
invisible except to its intended victim.  It may be seen by others
with Witchsight.  It appears as a glowing spectre of Ankh, with
piercing red eyes.  The warrior will continue with its mission until
the Adept’s concentration is broken, its intended victim dies, or it
is dissipated or slain.  The warrior can unerringly locate its
intended victim and will always move towards them at its full movement
rate, and engage them in melee combat.

The warrior has a single, combined, Endurance and Fatigue
Characteristic with a value of 20 (+ 5 per 3 full Ranks).  The
spectral warrior automatically hits every Pulse for [D - 4] (+ 1 /
Rank) damage. Its Initiative is 30 (+ 2 / Rank). The warrior has no
defence or armour value. It may not be Stunned.  The warrior’s
movement rate is 650 yards per minute, and its TMR is 13.  The warrior
may move in any direction without restriction, including through the
air, walls, water, etc., except through the area of a Necromantic
Special Counterspell. The warrior may be dissipated by having a
Necromantic Special Counterspell cast on the area it occupies.

If the warrior kills its victim then Ankh is aware that it has
happened and will gain a small amount of knowledge and influence where
victim died.

The Adept may communicate with any natural and unenchanted, animal,

and to what extent the communication may be carried is left up to the
GM’s discretion. The Adept must specify at the time of casting what
particular type of animal, bird or aquatic is to be conversed
with. The spell must be re-cast to speak to another type of animal,
bird, or aquatic.

\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{300}

\resist{None}
\target{Entity}
\rune{Entity} 
\begin{effects}
Prior to casting this spell the Adept must draw a Truth Rune on the
forehead (or equivalent) of the target.  The Rune of Truth causes the
target to be unable to speak a falsehood for the duration of the
spell.  The target must not knowingly say anything false, but may
refuse to answer a question put to them.

In addition, the bearer of the Truth Rune may attempt to see the true
nature of all things with a (PC + 2 × Rank) chance of noticing
deceptions, such as illusions, invisibility, shape or skin changing,
traps, and any other deception the GM sees fit.  Only one attempt may
be made per object.

The Truth Rune does not necessarily help the target see through the
deception, for example, an Illusory Wall will still be opaque, but the
target will know it is an illusion.
