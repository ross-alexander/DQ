Hired from the Seagate guild by Duke of Kazzala to investigate the
disappearance of children in the village of Forest-Mill.

# Diary

## 13th Thaw (10th month)

Equipment

-   3 weeks hard rations.
-   Guild riding horse each and 2-pack animals
-   Hay and oats.
-   Rough map or area too and surrounding Forest Mill.

## 13-17 Nov of 799 WK

Leave seagate and travel through Sweet-Riding following Sweet-Water
River towards Forest-Mill-no problems.

## 18 Nov of 799 WK

Reach forest today, and are ambushed by bandits in the night. Two (of
the temporary) party members return to the guild.

## 18-24 Nov of 799 WK

We travel on ...

-   By sweetwater river past a landing we find a peninsula (see Ty for
    exact position on map) of "white mana" orientated towards goodness.
-   A little further on we find a stone which is of "black mana" and
    orientated towards evil, investigation shows that it is magically
    trapped/warded/cursed the trap setting off a greater summoning, the
    trap is triggered by approach but the trigger distance has a
    variable range from the stone.
-   We decide to do nothing about these areas, but will inform the
    guild, esp about the black area.
-   We camp outside of the village for the night, meet two foresters in
    the morning.

## 24 Nov of 799 WK

Enter the village in the morning, first visit and talk with the local
lord, Lord George and then the sergeant and village people.

### Missing persons

-   Miller's son (baby).
-   Crofter John's son (6 yrs).
-   Smith's daughter.
-   Woodman Johnathon's son.
-   Widower Black's daughter (12 yrs).
-   Pete and Steven's younger brother (Marcus, 14yrs).
-   Old man Scott's wife.
-   Poacher Dale.

and more recently

-   Village simpleton.
-   Will the Guard.

### Rumour

-   the miller killed his own son, his wife is also acting strange, and
    the son does not look like his "father" is a cuckoo in the nest,
    either one of them could have gotten rid of the son.
-   Old man Scott is mad, but knows what's happening, he however does
    have a grudge against the miller.
-   The priest that lives by the graveyard has gone mad and is obsessed
    and tormented by daemons, who says he is protecting the town from
    the dead.
-   The old crone is to blame.
-   The crone herself says that the castle is much older than it looks
    and it may have been built to protect something on the site.
-   There is a local silf.
-   Will is up to something, and has his eye on the Lords daughter
    Victoria who has recently returned from Brastor, he can also be very
    nasty and will not go near the crone.
-   And that old man Scott's wife has left him in the night.
-   The local simpleton has been up to the old keep and returned without
    harm, he did say that there was treasure there.

### Fact

-   All these people have disappeared in the last 6 months.
-   There is a local ruined keep that is cursed, and the lord has
    forbidden people to go there.

### Old man Scott says

-   Old man Scott-last spell to impact is demonic, summoning.
-   There was an incident at the keep involving Lord George's father,
    who was digging a new cellar and came across some artefact which the
    old Lords wife thought was jewellery, and when she picked it up it
    killed her instantly and caused the collapse of the cellar with old
    Lord, his wife, his son and one of the labourer diggers Fred inside.
    The old Lord killed himself in grief and Fred died in the collapse
    so only the son was dug out alive after three in the dark with his
    dead parents and the artefact.
-   There are two entrances to the cellar one is blocked and one old man
    Scott (another labourer digging out the cellar) dug out to fee the
    young George. No bodies were ever recovered and Lord George has not
    been able to face going back.
-   There is also an old mill further up the stream on the way to the
    ruined keep.
-   3-4 goblin families live in an old silver mine up in the hills, they
    keep the local guard on their toes.

### Injured Guard Bill

-   The sergeant has one boy who could do with healing from burns, a
    divination on the boy under the pretence of healing shows magic to
    impact of telepathy, esp, hypnosis all in the last week and
    blackfire (celestial) about 10 weeks ago..
-   The boy cannot remember what happened to him, only that he was at
    the old mill with another guard Will who suggested going to the old
    keep, so that's where they went.
-   On further prompting bill remembers that he was in the cellar and
    somehow injured, he felt very cold and very sore.

### Old way station

-   Meanwhile we are put up at an old waystation that is sometimes used
    by the guards to overnight.
-   Investigation for secret doors etc reveals several large chambers
    under the stables.
-   The first chamber is a hidden cellar that contains old confiscated
    goods, we manage to pick out several bottles of good wine, the rest
    is dusty and useless with age.
-   A second secret entrance leads to another large chamber with a
    pervading aura of white magic which wards against the unholy, it is
    also protected to keep out lesser summoned creatures, the walls are
    bound earth so elementals cannot enter, there is no dust here and
    the air is fresh, and there is a fresh supply of water. Runes of 72
    names?? run around all the walls.

### Evening

-   We are attacked by 4 human fighters and 1 human fire mage with rank
    10 Weapon of Flames and rank 10 Fireball.
-   Tulip almost dies but Tye manages to save everyone, we capture one
    attacker.
-   The back of the Way-house is burned down.
-   Divination of the attacking humans shows Fire Armour, Fire Proofing,
    Telepathy, ESP, Sleep, Hypnosis, Charm, all within the last week,
    there is also a control person two weeks old and these spells on and
    off until we run out of time, the spells are of mind and e& demonic
    origin.
-   Sergeant arrives after all the action, we get him up to date.
-   We recover all the bodies and it turns out that Will is one of the
    dead attackers.
-   the Sergeants men stay on guard while we sleep for the rest of the
    night.

## 25 Nov of 799 WK

-   We arise before dawn and take the bodies up to the new keep
    barracks.
-   We then DA all the guards for last magic to impact.
-   Alfred (Sergeant) has nothing.
-   John has a faint blessing.
-   Chris has nothing.
-   Bill has been done already.
-   Mike has nothing.
-   Will is dead.
-   We search, question and divinate the prisoner.

We find a small "black" magic coin (red gold, plane of origin Hell),
who's nature of magic is to summon (call master) Aim, The Fire Duke.

The prisoner will not talk and Tye baulks at torture, the most we can
get is that he has been promised power by Aim and his leader is a
firemage.

-   Will had been subverted.

We search Bill's room while he is otherwise occupied and find another
small coin, however it is cursed, the person attempting to use it to
call Aim will get Incinirated for his pains.

Further talk to Bill nudges his memory and he remembers two huge dogs
at the old keep that suddenly appeared and burned him. He also
remembers there being other men from Brastor at the old keep, and
these same may be at the new keep with Lord George. Will gave him the
coin.

We decide not to go to Lord George in case he is in it, but to find
some firmer evidence.
	
We visit the old mill and fine Dale the local poacher near to death
and take him back to the town barracks.

We visit the priest at the church and find him being attacked by two
invisible imps which we deal with, but the priest does appear to be
entirely mad. We also find he had been dabbling in Necromancy as he
has two hefty tomes on the subject. He does manage to tell us that the
old Lord is an undead revenant at the old keep and that the woman is
lost in hell, if we are able to return the bones to consecrated ground
this may set the revenant at rest.

We leave the priest in the "white" graveyard and take Alfred and
another guard up with us to visit the old keep, only the party after
"armouring up" enter past the outer keep wall

We find the hole where old man Scott dug out young George from the
cellar, we also find the revenant of the old Lord (celestial mage).

We converse and find that the revenant requires his son personally to
retrieve his and his wife's bones for decent berial and then he will
lay to rest.

He has little knowledge of Aim's servants, only that they use the
rooms under the keep and that they cannot be accessed this way,
however at noon tomorrow there is to be a ceremony to summon Aim and
make him non-banishable from this plane. There is one priest, a fire
mage mostly rank 10 and there are two hell hounds or dire wolves.

We are permitted to retrieve Fred's bones which we give to the guards
to take back to the priest.

We try to find another entrance and set Buzz to track some burnt
patches in the ground (left from the breath of hell-hounds) he leads
us around to the west of the castle were we are ambushed by the
hell-hounds, we vanquish these, and after much searching Buzz
eventually finds an entrance into an underground corridor.

Down the corridor we find several empty barracks rooms and after an
upward slope the corridor terminates at a door with runes carved on
it. We push through into a large chamber with archers and domes and
find a priest sacrificing children at a make-shift alter, there are 5
thugs and 4 children, one is murdered as we watch.

We start out doing well against the thugs but then the tides turn and
Tulip almost dies again, only Tye is left standing wounded and
surrounded by the thugs, and by this time the mage has produced two
salamanders. Runes on the walls are glowing and getting brighter and
brighter ... all looks lost.

Then the mage expires from wounds received, and before he died he
managed to summon an effrete. When it turns up it cannot find its
summoner, so looks to Tye for commands and he tells it to kill all the
followers of Aim with ten miles ... it kills all Aims followers here
and disappears out the tunnel into the countryside.

We quickly do some healing etc, but the salamanders have got out and
started lots of forest fires, Ty somewhat reinvigorated chases them
down.

We check out the domed room, it is magical but not magically trapped
warded or cursed with respect to the non-followers of Aim. It appears
to be a kind of mana storage device, the triggering conditions are the
invocation of a summoning ritual ... maybe useful to some in the
guild.

A search of the bodies recovers ordinary weapons. The priests dagger
is magical and trapped warded or cursed the trigger is touch so we
leave it putting a large chalk circle around it and one of the local
guards to guard it.

In search of the keep above the chamber we find the body of Steven's
14 yr old brother with his throat slit from behind and nothing of
value.

We go up to the new keep but no-one answers the front door, we go
in. Pete (the butler) is dead and Lord Georges daughter is also dead,
we arrange to talk to Lord George in the morning. We go to the
barracks and find everything normal, we talk to Alfred and then retire
to the way station for the night

We leave the mad priest and the children with the old Crone for the
night.

## 26 Nov of 799 WK

We divinate items at the dome.

Alter
:   Has had two sacrifices and is consecrated to Aim. Mana storage adds
    to his power when he gets here.

Dagger
:   Gives death aspect to the wielder. Rquires a sacrifice every moon
    cycle or it takes the life of the wielder has cumulative 1% chance
    of dying with every moon cycle

Red Cloak
:   Gives 3 points of armour (can be worn over armour put protection
    does not stack with armour). The wearer (and their posessions) are
    Fireproofed. There is a 1% chance that is it suffers fire damage it
    will itself go up in flames and be destroyed.

Ty summons Belladonna and we ask that a guild party be sent out to
deal with the dome and the dagger and to intercede politically with
Lord George and Duke if required.

We go to the new keep and have lunch with Lord George and George
junior, Lord George's wife is absent. We explain events and that Lord
George has to go up and set the revenant of his father to rest, he is
not happy but we offer to come along and help. So we and Lord George
go back to the old keep and Lord George goes in to get the bones of
his father, when he brings them out the revenant walks into the
sunlight and disappears.

The guild recovery, clean up grew arrives in the early afternoon, we
spend some time explaining what happened and showing them around.

An air mage in the recovery party conjures up a cloud and we get a
free ride back to the guild.
