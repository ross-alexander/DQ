# Diary

## 1/10

-   Guild Meeting
-   Sebastian of Hamburg.
-   Need to look for a secure area in a valley near Kiel. Outside any
    "owned" baronies. No maps so need to map the area if possible,
    clear and brigands, etc.
-   500 sp pp up front x 500 pp for information = 1000 sp per person

## 2/10 {#section_1}

-   Scab skin changes horses into mice for easy flying
-   Sebastian casts shadow wings for all party members within casting
    chamber (pitch black)
-   Party fly to Kiel / Stay night.
-   Uzi and Scab in guards house/jail
-   Arkham, Belladonna, Sebastian and Tári at an Inn (60sp)

## 3/10 {#section_2}

-   Fly into area. Scout the area, eventually see smoke. Using Tári\'s
    familiar (Falcon) and Heinrick, try and take a better look.
-   Screams heard, Heinrick arrives back with a human\'s eye.
-   Head down to camp at dark, finding a group of people at a set of
    ruins.
-   Sentry guard killed, while Sebastian sends in a meteor shower to
    disable/kill other guards.
-   Go into ruin finding further humans and an invisible wolf as leader.
    Invisible wolf is mage, probably wicker due to spells being cast.
-   Kill most, 3 alive taken prisoner, wolf gets away.
-   Interrogate prisoners. Say:

    1.  they are fleeing recruitment in Flinar army.
    2.  that there is a large camp of bandits at end of valley (mouth of
        valley)
