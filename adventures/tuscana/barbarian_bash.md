Time on adventure
:  10 days  8/4/07 - 18/4/07

Ishmael hires us for 5K sp each for "decent results".  Plan is: Follow
trader-scum from Tycho, dey buy loot of Dark Circle from barbarians,
see who traders selling loot too.  Where weapons from too.

Wait 2 days - Ishmael only gives us 2 charges of rank 6 wings each,
den says we must pay, tight bastard.  Piss about in Brastor talking to
traders and guards about Sea of Grass.  Fly northish to bit below
Tuscana at night.  Spot light, land and sneaky forwards.  Crystals and
FlameSight check it da caravan.  Get rat to put me finely made Locate
token on one and back off to camp.

Next day follow dem till dusk, see some horsemen north.  Dey stop for
da night and set up camp and a tent with anti-scrying on it.  Hobbit
says he not sneaky - HA! so mes bravely sneak in but cant see too
much.  Precog/astrology implies trade fare tomorrow.  Fore big traders
seem magical and antiscry, da cheats.

Next day barbarians turn up, including some grey eastern orcs in
plate.  Trading goes on, mostly cowardly bows to da barbs and loot
back to traders.  One conan-type buys a woman in a coffin(?).  Decide
to grab something/one to burn in Flamesight, but get rumbled by a
"Trader" who seems to know about Arkham's Telephathy and circles it to
find centre/us.  We fly/flee, me strongly with a barbarian, who knows
squat all, so me bravely fight him to death.  Fly back to Brastor.
Talk to Ishmael, check barbarian sword in Flamesight, which shows it
was mass-produced in a smei-Gnomish machine.

Fly back to planes next night.  Check location of caravan, seems going
to Tuscana, so fly to south and wait.  Get accosted by border patrol
who say to go to Grenada (city) for passes if we want to be in
Tuscana.  Walk all day.

Walk all day, too much fucking walking, and get to Grenada.  Spend day
checking about.

Next day; Watch and wait, too much fucking waiting, see caravan 100
miles to south heading this way.

Next day; appear on locate (75 miles), but seem lighter or something.
Fly out dat night to deir old campsite, find tracks of a (single?)
cart going nother way to Tuscana.  Firewalk to follow.  Stop and look,
cant see anything, but something seems wrong.  Fly to jump over a
bunch of trees, sneak back and ESP gets a mind which disappears
straight away.  Wait till dawn.

Next day see patrol on da road while we watch da trees.  After a bit
of stuff we track to a farm.  Some other guards seem to confirm da
deal is here...  While pissing about a fancy cart turns up with hummie
guards, driver, servant.  Old human guy gets out, well dressed but not
flash with sabre, Telepathy dont work, same old anti-scry shit too.
He goes into da horse barn with invisible cart, and dey load some
boxes to fancy cart and head off to Grenada.  Track to posh bit of
town, but it looks tough to scope.  Go back to inn for night.

Next day go to citydel to find out about merchant dudes.  Meet Maria
Scarlia, old hag bint.  Most trading is food goods.  Tarachi merchants
seem da ones, newer house, aggressive, all houses have been having a
hard time as army have nicked all deir stuff for war.  Also find a
magic loot shop, bit waffly but dey sell month-ish duration stuff.
Get a cheap scry-detection for 5 days for 500sp.  Fly back to
Emmesburg to tell Ishmael - adventure complete, woohoo!

Time on adventure
:  4 days 18/4/07 - 22/4/07

Back to Brastor Landing, decide to go troll hunting...  fly to Choth
Gap and da Thornewood.  It's a shitty Dark Circle swamp.  Ground/area
is weird, aura = animal undead GTN = Thorns of Corruption, sort of
undeadish.  Spend day warding.  Next day set up goat lures etc.  Get
jumped by two trolls dat night, kill dem, burn and fly back to
Brastor.  Scab does Troll Dust, 17 doses + 1 spec grev paste.  Sell 2.
