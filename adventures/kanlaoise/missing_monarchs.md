## World of Whispers

This white-silvery metal feather is roughly a two inches by one inch
in size, completely flat and of negligible weight.  By whispering to
feather an Adept can pass the whisper to up to eight other people.
The Whisper travels at one mile / pulse.  Each recipient of a Whisper
can reply with a single word answer.  While there is no limitation of
the number or duration of Whispers the item will lose it magic after
ten minutes after the first Whisper starts.  Once it lost its magic
the item has no residual value.

## Snatched Conversation

This tiny brass (approximately one inch in length) ear trumpet.  When
triggered the Adept can hear the conversation of the target for the
next 15 minutes, provided they are within a mile.  Anything spoken by
the target or directly to the target will be relayed to the listener.

This counts as magical scrying and any magic which detects it or
blocks scrying will work against this.

## Windform

This potion will turn the drinker into wind, as per the Spell of Wind
Walk, with a duration of ten minutes.  In addition the target can
suspend and restart the spell by using a Magical Fire Action.  The
duration of the spell is fixed and will run down even if the target is
has suspended the spell.

## Herbs of Contentment

This bag of dried herbs contains four doses.  Each dose, when added
to a meal, will make the consumers of the meal feel full for the
next 24 hours, and they will not feel the need to eat during
that period.  The herbs have no additional nutritional value
and should they become damp they will be ruined, otherwise they
will last indefinitely.

## Herbs of Aging

This bag of dried herbs contains four does.  Each dose, when added
to an appropriate liquid, such as wine or spirits, will age the
drink one period, so fresh wine will become young, young wine
will become aged, aged wine will become vintage and vintage
wine will become exceptional.  The herbs can be applied to the
same drink multiple times so a young wine can be turned into
an exceptional vintage if all four doses are used.  Should
the herbs become damp their will be ruined, otherwise they will
last indefinitely.

## Bag of Frozen Silk

This bag is made of fine silk imbued with Ice Magics so that the
contents will be chilled to freezing point of water.  It
has the capacity to carry up to 60lbs and the rough volume
of a full set of plate armour.  The Bag will sublime at the
Summer Solstice of 820WK.

## Armour of Frost

This magical plate armour is made from water imbued with Ice Magics.
As such it will melt and refreeze to fit any wearer from halfling to
hill giant.  Neither the armour nor the wearer can not have any armour
or defence spells on while it is worn.

The armour gives 9 points of protection and 30 points of defence.  It
is cold to the touch and will drain 1d5 points of damage from anything
which touches it without some from of protection.

The wearer will be under a protection from Cold Rank 20 while wearing
it.  It can also be sacrificed to avoid one specific grievous wound or
up to 60 point of Fire damage.

The armour will sublime at the Summer Solstice of 820WK.


## Tarot of Divination

This deck of Tarot can be used to perform the Ritual of Divination [as
per Naming Incantation R1].  The base chance is PC + 10% / Rank
in Astrology and takes twice the normal duration.  The deck
can only be used once per month, regardless of success.

## Pair of Jokers

While the Jokers originally came as a pair they can be used separately.
They have a number of abilities:
 - They can substitute themselves as a normal card in a deck of cards
   and will show up as a card favourable to the owner when played in a
   competitive game.  This will happen once per day.
 - In a social situation should the owner be outclassed in some
   fashion then the joker may be played.  At that point he will
   conveniently appear and explain while his owner is far superior at
   whatever is being contested and that the opponent should quickly
   and quietly back down.  Should it come to a contest the owner
   gains a second roll and make take which ever one is more favourable.
 - In any situation of appalling bad luck the owner may sacrifice the Joker
   in return for an improved outcome, to the discretion of the GM.
 - The Joker has a limited attention span and will slip away at the
   end of 825WK.

## Stay of Execution
 
This amulet, made from bone, is the size of human palm and wafer thin.
On it is a relief of the Goddess Shahdad.  Should the weaer die the
amulet will stay the death for 24 hours.  They will be effectively
dead as per the Necromancy Spell of Petit Mort.  The magic will ceause
should the wearer be healed suffiently within the 24 hour period,
otherwise they will die.  In all cases the amulet will lose its magic
and the wearer will suffer a permenent loss of 1 Endurance.  The
duration of the Stay Execution can be extended indefinitely by the
Healer Preserve Dead ability.
 
## Soul Binding

This gem of black amathyst is imbued with Necromatic Magics.  When
triggered any unbound soul, such as entity recently departed, or any
undead, will be trapped into the gem.  This can only be actively
resisted but the target will always have the chance to resist, even if
they then lose their next action.

Once the gem has been used the soul will remain there until the
next sundown, after which the gem will turn to dust and the
soul will be released.  However using the Ritual of Investment
and the use of 5,000sp of materials the soul can be transferred
into an object, where it will remain for the next year before
being released.

Should either the gem or a bound object holding a soul be destroyed
a previously living soul will move on while any undead soul will
be destroyed.

## Spell of Cause Harm

This is a set of inch long bone figurines, five in total.  Each holds
one charge of the Spell of Cause Harm.  The spell has a range of
60 feet and base chance of 120%.  It may be passively resisted
and is part of the College of Necromantic Conjurations for
the purposes of Counterspells.  Normal, double, and triple
effects will cause one, two or three wounds while normal, double
or triple resistance roll will reduce the number of wounds by
one, two or three (so a double effect that is normally resisted
will still cause one wound).  In all cases the target will
suffer 2d10 Endurance damage.  Each roll on the wound table is
done using 2d10 and is rolled by the caster.

 - 2: The victim takes a massive brain hemorrhage, killing them
   instantly.  It will require a Rank 9 healer four weeks to repair
   the brain enough for them to be resurrected.
 - 3: The target's eyes will become putrescent, blinding them until
   healed by Rank 9 healer, taking one day per eye.  Each ruined
   eye constantly bleeds blood and puss and will reduce the
   victim's PB by 5 and cause 1 EN per hour to be lost.
 - 4: The victim's throat has been ruined and they are
   unable to speak.  Breathing is difficult and will lose
   1 FT for any action beyond rest.  In addition they must
   make a 2xWP roll or blackout for 1d5 pulses.  It will take a Rank 7
   healer a day to repair.
 - 5: Broken secondary shoulder.  The shoulder joint seized up,
   leaving the arm unusable.  Any action which may jolt the shoulder
   will cause the victim excruciating pain, and they must make a 1xWP
   roll to complete the action.  It will take a Rank 6 healer a day to
   repair, until which the victim will suffer a -5 MD penalty and -3
   AG.

 - 6: The victim is inflicted with chronic seizures, especially when
   using magic.  Casting an special knowledge spell will cause
   the victim to fit for 2d10 pulses, where they will be unable
   to do anything except roll on the ground and twitch.  The
   casting of a general knowledge spell will cause 1d10 pulses
   of seizure.  The triggering of items and other such magical
   actions will result in similar episodes, the duration up to
   the discretion of the GM.  A Rank 9 healer is required
   to fix the victim, taking an hour to do so.
   
 - 7: This victim's stomach has been infected and every pulse must
   make an Endurance check.  Should they make 1xEN they are fine, 2xEN
   will result in mild vomiting, reducing the sucess of any action by
   30%, 3xEN will result in severe vomiting, and any action will will
   fail.  Any worse result the victim will vomit blood, causing 1d5 EN
   damage and unable to act.  Should the victim receieve any magic
   healing they may make an new endurance check and can continue to do
   so until they succeed at 1xEN.  A Rank 5 healer will take two days
   to repair the EN damage taken.

 - 8: Both the victim's ankles are broken.  Each broken ankle
   reduces their Agility by 10.  Should their AG be reduce below
   5 they are unable to stand, even with assistance.  It will
   take a Rank 6 Healer a day per ankle to repair.

 - 9: The victim's intestines have become inflamed and they will bleed
   constantly from their anus, causing 1 EN and 1 FT loss per pulse.
   It will take a Rank 6 Healer a day to repair the damage.

 - 10: The victim is inflicted with wasting, and will not receive any
   FT or EN gain from eating or sleeping.  Any magical healing will
   reduced by 75%.  Each day of wasting will reduce the victim's
   maximum FT, EN and PS by 1.  Should any reach 0 then they will pass
   away.  A Rank 7 Healer will repair the kidneys in a day but the
   lost stats will only return at a rate of 1 per day.

 - 11: The victim's skin has become diseased and will constantly
   flake.  In addition their hair will fall out, losing 10% per hour
   until their are bald.  They are an appalling sight and suffer -10 PB
   until Healed by a Rank 4 Healer, taking two hours.

 - 12: The victim's lung have been damage and will easily become
   winded.  Any physical exertion (such as combat or spell casting)
   will leave the victim winded for 1d10 pulses, where they can
   only do pass actions.  A Rank 9 Healer will repair this
   in a day.
   
 - 13: The victim is inflicted with a severe rash, their skin red and
   raw.  Touching the skin will cause it to bleed, causing 1 EN
   damage.  The wearing of anything other than light cloth will cause
   constant bleeding, each pulse the victim losing APs worth of EN.
   A Rank 4 Healer can heal this in an hour.  Until then the victim
   will suffer -5 PB.

 - 14: The victim's kidneys have failed.  They will urinate blood and
   each time will suffer 1d5 EN.  Additionally toxins will begin to
   poison them, so that every hour there is a (60+EN)% that PS, EN, PB

   victim will pass away.  A Rank 7 Healer will repair the kidneys in
   a day but the lost stats will only return at a rate of 1 per day.

 - 15: The victim is inflicted with aggressive cancer and will reduce
   PB, AG, MD, EN & FT by one per day.  Should any stat reach 0 they
   will die.  The cancer is throughout the body and requires a week for
   healing for every day that they have suffered, regaining one point
   per week until fully healed.  This requires a the attention of a
   Rank 5 Healer full time to cure, or Rank 8 three days a week.

 - 16: Both ear drums have burst, causing blood to leak from the ears
   at the rate of 2 EN / hour.  The victim is completely deaf and
   disoriented.  While this doesn't effect their movement anything
   which requires balance has an 80% base chance reduction.  Spell
   casting is also effected with an 20% BC reduction.  A Rank 7 Healer
   will take a day per ear to repair.

 - 17: The victim's spine has been severed and they are now
   a paraplegic, with no Agility and half PS.  Their entire

   are completely paralysed.  A Rank 9 healer will require
   a full week to bring them back.

 - 20: The victim suffers a fatal cardiac arrest, resulting in instant
   death.  It will require a Rank 9 healer four weeks to repair the
   heart enough for them to be resurrected.

## Flute of Blessed Release

This fine foot long bone rod is imbued with Magic of Necromantic
Conjurations.  Should a successful strike be made any soul holding on
by magic along will be slain.  This includes those under the effects
of Trollskin, Stay of Execution, Petit Mort or magical Healing.  This
will also effect any Undead that can be physically struck and cannot
be resisted.  This is a single use item.

## Bone Spikes

These nine inch nails are made from bone and have a blackened and aged
appearance.  Should they be driven into a victim then it will drain
victim 1 FT (or EN if no fatigue) every four hours.  The wielder will
gain that as 1 FT (to their maximum) and an hour of rest, so they
avoid needing to sleep.  This can be done as many time as their are
spikes (currently four).  The range of connection is limited to same
plane.

However the spikes are brittle and the act of driving them may damage
them (wielder must make 2xMD or the spike will shatter).  Additional
the victim can make a magic resistance vs Necromantic Conjurations
once per 24 hours.  Should they success they will overcome the magic,
causing the spike to crumble to dust.

## Lantern of Truelight

This Fairy Light is a inch cube, held in a brass cage approximately a
foot cube.  It gives out a cool white light (effectively Rank 15 at
source).  Anything disguised or hidden by magic means will be
reveiled, including all forms of shapeshifting and polymorph.  The
lantern is somewhat unreliable and is prone to not work half the time
when activated.  It can be coaxed into working by tapping it but it is
fragile and moving or hitting the lantern will break it (and the Light)
should the wielder fail an 70%+MD check.

## Potion of Berserker

This potion will cause the drinker to enrage into a blood lust.  They
gain +30 SC, +2 DM, +5 PS and +1 TMR.  They cannot be stunned and
regenerate damage at 1 EN per pulse.  However they cannot take part in
military scientist timeout, will not follow any order and will not
retreat.  The effect lasts two minutes.

There are currently 6 potions.

## Potion of Energy

This potion will cause the drinker to gain 15 FT (on top of their
normal maximum).  Additional they make convert a point of EN to FT as
a free action every pulse.  This effect lasts five minutes and at the
end will cause the drinker 15 EN in damage and reduce their FT to 0.
Their maximum FT will be reduce by 15, returning a 3 per hour.

There are currently 5 potions.

## Potion of Action

This potion will cause the drinker to act with haste.  They will gain
+15 IV, 3 TMR and an additional pass action.  This effect will stack
with Quickness and lasts one minute.  However the drinker will then
suffer chronic fatigue for the next 15 minutes, unable to act every
second pulse (similar to Slowness).

There are currently 3 potions.

## Runestaff of Garnliness

This heavy staff is 7 feet in length and weights a hefty 10lb.  It is
made from ancient blackroot oak and requires 16 PS [but only 10 MD] to
wield as weapon.  It is a magic weapon with a base chance of 90% and
D+14 damage as it imbued with magic of Runeweapon.  Only hill giants
or larger can use it single handed.  The staff will also provide
defence of 3% / Rank while being used as a weapon.

The staff can also be used to Smite.  It contains a single charge
of Smite but can be recharged by ritual casting of a Rank 10 Smite
spell into the staff.

When an entity is Smited [successful strike check] they must make 1xPS
check or be thrown back 5 feet and knocked prone, causing an extra
5 damage.  Should an object be Smited the object may shatter, depending
on the size.  An ordinary wooden door will shatter into fragments
while the walls or gates of a city will not even notice.  It is
up to the GM as to its effectiveness.  Using the Runestaff to 
Smite has its risks and it will break on 70%+MD.

## Scimitar of Serration

This weapon is a poorly made single edged weapon of low quality metal.
However its cutting edge has many tiny bone fragments embedded into
it.  It can be used with any singled edge 1h weapon skill and has a
50% SC and D+6 damage.  Any successful strike, if it causes at least
one damage, will cause a gashing wound, bleeding 2 EN / pulse.  An
Endurance hit will cause 3 EN / pulse bleeder while an specific
grievous blow will always result (no roll on the table) the victim to
be eviscerated, causing an immediate 5 EN damage extra and 4 EN /
pulse bleeder.  The wound requires a Rank 6 Healer a week to repair,
although a Rank 3 can stop the bleeding.

There are 7 scimitars currently.

## Potion of Lightness of Being

The drinker is transformed into a being of pure light.  While a being
of light they are immune to all physical and elemental damage, may
fly anywhere light may travel and move at the speed of light.  They
cannot think or act any faster so complex movement will require time.
As light they do not radiate heat but anything that would take damage
from sunlight will be affected.

The drinker can cast magic however Earth, Dark or Shadow Celestial, Water,
Ice or Air Magics do not work.  They can speak and be heard, their
voices like the shimmering of crystal.

The effect of the potion lasts for five minutes.

## Potion of Sun Shadow

The drinker can teleport to the edge of any shadow made by direct
sunlight within 1000 miles, provided the drinker can see the shadow
(or know it exists).  As such crystals of vision or similar would
work, or telepathy or distance telepresence.

The effect is instant (appearing the following pulse) upon drinking.

## Staff of Solar Radiance

This staff is ten feet long and hair width thick, completely rigid and
made from a material of stupendous weight.  It is embedded into simple
hard metal tube a foot long at one end, the tube coming with covered
handles.  In total it weights around 100lb and requires PS 20 to
effectively use.

Once triggered the far end will burn with the light and heat of a
minute sun, doing effectively unlimited damage (similar to Light
Sphere) to anything it touches.  Anybody looking at the light must
either having Protection from Light or be blinded (no save).  It also
radiates searing heat, causing 5d10 damage to anything in a megahex
around it (-1d10 per 4 ranks of Protection from Light).

Triggering it will also trigger a Rank 20 Protection from Light on the
wielder.  The duration of the Radiance is an hour, the staff consuming
itself during that time, so that only the metal tube is left.

Contact with a Dark Sphere will result in a cataclysmic release of
energy and should be avoided at all costs.

## Sunflashes

These glass marbles shine with a bright light [similar to a bright
lantern], but no heat.  They are solid and require a point of damage
to break.  Upon breaking they will release a Rank 15 Flash of Light
(as per the Illusion Spell, save against Solar [Celestial]).

A handful (however big that is) can be used at once.  There
are two bags, each containing 30.

## Tent of Scry Protection

This beautiful, and rather ornate, silk tent holds up to five people,
standing.  Provided it is fully closed those inside are protected from
all forms of direct scrying.  This will not protect against Astrology
but does include Telepathy and ESP.  It is somewhat cumbersome as the
poles are solid ash and takes 30 minutes to unpack and put up, and
another 30 minutes to take down and pack again.

The magic of the tent is permanent and can be used many times as
wanted but the material is fragile and flammable.  Should the material
be cut or damaged there is roughly a damage% chance the magic will be
destroyed (so a 8 point cut from a sword would require less than 92 on
a save roll).  Damage is cumulative but the tent can be repaired
by a Rank 8 or higher artisan of the appropriate skill, costing
100sp per point of damage.

## Potion of Shapeshift

This potion will transform the drinker into a creature no smaller than
a mouse and no larger than an elephant for up to 24 hours.  They keep
their mental abilities, EN & FT.  They may cast magic if the creature
has the necessary physiology for speech and appropriate gestures.
Unless subject to Ancient Divination they will appear as that
creature.  Should they creature be sentient (for example shapeshifting
to drow) they will keep their college etc.  Otherwise they will show
up exactly as a normal creature of that type would.
