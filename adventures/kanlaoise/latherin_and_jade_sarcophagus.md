Turf finds a card in his pocket saying \"Opps opps opps\", it is from
[Baccarat](Baccarat "wikilink") and has Rank 20 counterspells for Mind
special, Celestial special and general, Fire special and general. Turf
gets us all together and we talk to Baccarat. An animated magical
sentient object/artefact (NOT daemonic) has got loose (it was provoked
and attacked and is now retaliating) and is burning/destroying cities on
[Kanlaoise](Kanlaoise "wikilink"). It produces lots of flashing light,
perhaps is solar item (re solar elves) and Baccarat has had a nasty
premonition of it kicking his butt.

We go to the graveyard where the \"portal\" tree that young [Varenthia
Simbelyn](Varenthia_Simbelyn "wikilink") gave us has been planted and go
through to [Kanlaoise](Kanlaoise "wikilink"). Tulip takes a nice big
sack of leaf mould for the ents who look after the forest where the
portal trees reside. We take a tree to the forest near Baccarat\'s
manor. He provides us with an \"avoid fate\" card each and
[Delerium](Delerium "wikilink") gives us each an \"true form\" invested.

Background
: The four key fractions of
  the [Kijaand Empire](Kijaand_Empire "wikilink") are upping the
  anti. [Regent\'s](Kosiva_Zaorich "wikilink") party holds the throne
  and the regent wants to be empress. The [Church](Shahdad "wikilink")
  party supports the imperial family. The Emperor is or is-not dead
  but is very well hidden, the family is weakened and in hiding. The
  Non-aligned are hedging their bets and supporting whoever appears to
  be weakest to try and support the balance of power. There is general
  unrest, the economy is running down and there is a low level civil
  war running between the Church and the Regent, and an all out war on
  the horizon. Artefacts are appearing, there are two other powerful
  artefacts that have appeared recently, the goddess Shahdad
  interfered directly to take one, the others whereabouts is unknown.

## Lasilae

We find out the artefact is celestial, produces white fire (it is
nuking the city) and can change the local gravity around it. Scrying
breaks down in its vicinity. We travel by maze
to [Lasilae](Lasilae "wikilink"). We see a continual blue-white light
and as we approach the wind is gale force and the temperature is
45Â°. Death aspect is working but in a perverted way, it seems souls
are being trapped and not passing on as they should. Aura\'s are
warped, and the ground has tainted earth mana. A white sphere heads
straight for us and then stops we talk to it, it doesn't converse but
says "step into my world".

## The Inbetween {#the_inbetween}

We determine it is not an avatar, but it is a portal (destination
"between worlds") and we all step in to find ourselves standing in a
square and on black and white tiles. There is a perfect image of turf
which we do DA as an avatar of the plane, origin Kanloaise and its
purpose is "liberation, deactivation and entrapment". We ask what it
is trying to do? It replies "Destroy what holds life to death, enter if
you wish", and two door appear. It says "You will face that which
destroys, the white door leads back and the black door leads forward."

## And back? {#and_back}

We go through the black door and arrive in a featureless stone
courtyard, with stairs up to a wooden door on the right. The light is
grey and all pervading (there are no shadows). We battle 3 wraiths which
are tough, Tulip is hamstrung. We make it to the doors, which are of
petrified wood and have base relief worked into them, there is an
imperial like sigil but it is not identical to the one we know from
Kanleash.

Inside is a palace we first come upon a man in black armour with red
glowing eyes sits who commands the wraiths. We kill him and take his
armour (it is in pieces). We then navigate through various rooms to
arrive at a long ball room with a throne at one end, on which sits a
pallid middle aged elf in mitheral chain and winged helm. We all drool
over the armour.

The elf is undead necromancer named Latherin. He tells us we need to
find the vaults and that we will have to fight him for the key. We go
at him but magic seems to bounce off him so Turf is doing the most
damage. Things are all a bit fishy as he is being helpful, and seems
to be directing the fight in a certain direction. He appears to be
geased (and wants to be free)? playing with us?

He tells us we must take the key from his cold dead hand and "directs"
us toward a study and down some spiral stairs to a crypt with a
sarcophagus. Each time Turf manages a spec greiv on Lathering there
are flashes of light and the light becomes more intense in general. In
the end, they play act a fight and Turf taking the key. We are not
sure if we should use the key or not, if we don't he remains trapped
and white sphere / artefact will just continue to rampage. If we do
use the key he can raise and lead an army of undead, but the sphere
will be stopped.

We decide to use the key, it makes part of one wall opaque and we can
see into a room of white marble with a finely crafted jade sarcophagus
with delicate detail and elven writing on it. Latherin walks through and
he disappears leaving his armour and clothing in a pile, we gather them
up! There is a magical helm (thaumaturgy), mitheral shirt, with armoured
shoes and grieves (partial plate) his weapons are main gauche, and
scimitar and we are also left with the key as well as some fine elven
robes.

We go into the room to investigate the jade coffin. The writing states
"Those who rest here shall rest alone", inside is Latherin's body. The
light is now blinding and all of the walls become transparent.  This
is an earth place of power. After half an hour the light disappears
and the darkness of a natural evening envelops us. We are sitting in
the ruins of the city. We ask Baccerat what he has seen.
