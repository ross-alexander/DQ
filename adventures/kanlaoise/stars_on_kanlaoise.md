## Date: 05/04/08

A Norn (ice elf) turns up at the Guild and tells Uzi (ie he has no
choice) to organise a party to find path from
[Kanlaoise](Kanlaoise "wikilink") to [Alusia](Alusia "wikilink") taken
by the inscrutable sun-elf who recently talked to Blitzkrieg and hired
the high level party. Uzi collects Sebastian and Belladonna. The Norn
provides Uzi with a device that will locate the "passage to Alusia" when
activated on Kanloise, we get the guild to check it out, they say it OK.
We have time to fly up to the village below the Wok-master's Monastery,
we stay the night.

## Date: 06/04/08

Fly up to the Monastery, talk to the monks and then go on to tower which
is no-longer encased in ice so we can easily fly in and land. There are
Norns waiting who tell us that there have been people have been
investigating from the other side, and a sun-elf team tried to come
through about 10 months ago but were repulsed. Currently there is a
tense stand-off. We plan to go through mid-day here which is mid-night
there. We power up, the Norns offer enchantments (resist cold, ice
traversal, feather fall, vapour breathing) then we open the door and try
to fire-walk through. A lot of our magic switches off (wings, shadow
form, all fire magics), although we still have resist cold and vapour
breathing. It seems to be some kind of "hibernation ward". We recast
wings and fly down to a previously known area where we met some goblins,
we again meet goblins and trounce them. Then we fly following the rough
location of the locator device, we land and rest during the day. While
resting we see a patrol on horse back in the distance. When the sunsets
we fly again, then fire-run until morning.

## Date: 07/04/08

We rest for the day and then fly or fire run during the night.

## Date: 08/04/08

We rest for the day and then fly during the night.

## Date: 09/04/08

We rest for the day and then fly during the night, we reach the coast
and a very unpleasant storm rolls in.

## Date: 10/04/08

We rest for the day although we are pretty miserable as we cannot find
good cover from the storm. Then we fly during the night, and reach a
small forest of very old hardwood trees, we enter and rest.

## Date: 11/04/08

Part way through the day we are roused by dogs barking close by and we
find out, that we are in the ancient hunting preserve of the Imperial
House, we depart as stealthily as we can. We fly for the night reaching
a very large lake. We determine that the gateway is on an island in the
lake which stands just off shore of a sun-elf city of
[Mazarathin](Mazarathin "wikilink") (it is very well light!). We
investigate along the shore and then fly to the island, we find a path
leading one way to a forest of sentient trees occupied by nymphs and the
other toward a bridge. We decide to leave the Norns device carefully
hidden before taking the path, as the device also tracks us and we don't
want to give away secrets from this plane which would give them an
unfair advantage.

The bridge seems contract space/planes and leads to park created by the
star elves. In the park are many of their peculiar water fountains and
pools that capture and reflect starlight, be careful, if you look into
or touch the water you will become mesmerised.

The park is edged by a hedge which is magical (abjuration, barrier)
and there is a fantastically well crafted gate made from mitheral and
gems. We do an astrology reading, and read the night sky "speak with
the golden wonder, but tread carefully". We go through (ie we don't
open!) the starlight gate and become astral. The gate then appears as
an immensely strong presence on the astral plane. On the real plane,
the other side of the gate is the Imperial palace of the sun-elf city,
the gate is guarded by two imperial guards who wear many enchantments
and so stream brightly on the astral plane.

We are insubstantial and can move very quickly through the sun-elf
city. We locate [Orthostopheles](Orthostopheles "wikilink") (the
golden one) and chat, he may have work for us soon. However he is
still establishing his presence on this plane. We return to the park
and go back through the star-gate. We experience the stars in
different ways, and each one of us is changed in some small
way. Sebastian as an astrologer seems to have a more intense
experience and seems a little unhinged after the event, gabbling about
seeing "everything".

We then go back along the bridge, this time we see an orchid at the
forest (island) end of the path, we determine that the trees are
portals to different planes. A very
young [Varenthia](Varenthia_Simbelyn "wikilink") comes out of the
trees and offers us an oak sapling to take back to Alucia. We recover
the Norn item, step back onto the path and use one of the orchid trees
to get back to Alucia.

## Date: 12/04/08

We give the sapling to [Callas](Callas "wikilink"), and meet the Norn at
the guild. The Norn gives us 6,000sp each and ice crystal of "life
preservation" each, which of course also is a location beacon for the
Norn. We also each gain some effect from going through the star-gate.
