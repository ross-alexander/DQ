## Date: 01/03/09 (day 1)

Dark-skinned Elf from the Imperial Court of Kanlesh wants us to
deliver invitations to various highly placed and extremely dangerous
individuals who are for the most part the proven enemies of the court.
The invitations are of heavy card with ornate gold/silver writing, and
they are highly magica.  They are magically protected and can only be
opened by the recipient.  They will change colour in the local of the
recipient and turn gold on being placed in the recipients hands.  If
answered, a message will be returned to the imperial court elves.
They should be delivered within the next 100 days, she will pay 500sp
for the first message and an amount increasing by 500sp per
invitation.  She gives us symbols that will identify us as Imperial
Messengers.

-	Bulich of Highvale (Orc leader, male, Highvale)
-	Corisova (1/2 elf mind mage, female, Unknowable)
-	Grampian Wrought Iron (Dwarf, retired leader, male, Wrought Iron holdings)
-	Tinkermeister Tune-up (Gnome, male, Blackstone dwarven holdings)
-	Varenthia Symbelion (Elf, close to ascension, female, Ice Tower)
-	Valerie Longmeadow (Hobbit, Mayor of Longmeadow, female, Longmeadow)
-	Norion Sweptsands (Human, Leader, male, Sweptsands)
-	D'Urzi Drad Ziamen (Ice Elf, male, Ice Tower)
-	Morgan the Grey (Human, wicca, male, Elven Tower at Sernoyia)

She provides a general warning that flying is unsafe, ice drakes
patrol the mountains and are very possessive of airspace, elven guards
patrol settled areas.  She gives us two binder items to aid in travel
and a third which will help answer our questions.  We are also given a
"word of recall" which when uttered will return us to the Temple of
the Sun in the city of Yue'Palan, but this should not be used lightly.
We test the items before departing (some of the following information
was obtained during the mission).  Incense burner & 10 lots of incense
oil

- drip the incense on the burner to activate (1 pulse)
- creates a wind funnel of ≈60miles/hr
- takes wielder and those selected in the immediately surrounding hexes
- check against 3*WP to change direction
- takes 1 pulses to power up and then will last for 5min, it will go clear 1 pulse before it stops
- very dangerous

Shadow shifter
- allows wielder to step between sharply delineated shadows "within sight"
- can do 10's miles, maybe more
- it possible to target from a crystal of vision
- takes 1min to open the portal, and the portal remains open for 30sec
- can travel both ways through the portal while it is open
- shadows must be sharp

Solar spark
- flying spark of light, semi-sentient
- we also believe it is a spying device and that the elves can gain information from it
- answers simple questions from limited database of knowledge
- rudimentary direction sense and positioning
- able to act as a limited guard device (but very local only 20 ft)
- can become dim or very bright

We arrange to be summoned to the city of Yue'Palan at the beginning of
the 6th day from now at midnight.  We prepare clothing for both very
warm and very cold climates.

## Date: 02-05/03/09 (days 2-5)

Fly to Brasta where Sebastian outfits Mirage with some ranked weapons
and armour.

## Date: 06/03/09 (day 6)

We appear in dense pillars of light within one of a number or alcoves
off a very large room (cathedral?) that is a Sun place of power.
There are very sharp shadows created and priestesses obviously using
these for magical tasks, we can identify scrying.  Spark leads us to
another column we can see in the light: a city spanning many islands
on a wide river delta, there is a large bridge spanning the whole
delta (it has foundations on a number of islands which behave like
stepping stones).  This is the city of Yue'Palan.  Some of the islands
only have water access, other islands have small bridges.  The city
appears partly elven-made in the sense that channels have been dug out
to create islands and improve passage.

We pass into this pillar of light and appear in a small stone
courtyard outside an Imperial Compound on one of the larger islands.
We make our way to the main bridge, hale a passing hobbit caravan and
gather information, they identify where Longmeadow is, and then they
take us with them to visit a dwarven island, where we speak to the
dwarves who have information on Grampian.

Sebastian trades for some gems, we arrange to take messages to the
Wrought Iron Dwarves, and are given some dwarven supplies (Rum (very
sweet), Bread (very sweet) and Cram (toffee with nuts and dried
fruit)) The Star thinks Tinkemeister is in Yue'Palan and we obtain
directions to the Gnomish island.  When we visit, Sebastian tests out
a jet-pack, and we find that Tinkermeister is working for the
Blackstone Dwarves.  We take accommodation for the night.  We quiz the
Spark about all the personages, and Sebastian marks those that we can
on a map he has.

## Date: 07/03/09 (day 7)

We pick up letters and supplies from the dwarves, walk out of the
city, cast wings and fly along the river towards the mountain range.
Soon we leave the settled farm lands behind and enter a rain-forest.
Along the river are palisade areas for the elven boats to stop,
obviously the territory is unsafe.  We land in an empty one for the
night and are attacked by ninja goblins.  Defeat the goblins, loot the
bodies.

## Date: 08/03/09 (day 8)

We sleep late into the morning.  Fly up to the head of the river, this
land is settled by a number of elven houses, there are two forts and
some elves fly out and question us.  The also give us information on
the dwarves, we fly over to the "Lower Entrance" of the dwarven clan
holdings, give our messages over and spend the rest of the day
climbing the escarpment, since Grampian lives at the top.  We get most
of the way there but need to stop for weakling hobbit to rest the
night.

## Date: 09/03/09 (day 9)

We reach the "New Hold" in the morning and take a lift the rest of the
way to the top.  Our guides Mac and Cameron then take us out to
Grampians stone house.  We give him his invitation (500sp), and ask
him for information on the other personages.  He is clearly a high
ranked Astrologer, but very old now.  Spend the rest of the day
training, and the evening drinking with the Dwarves.

## Date: 10-14/03/09 (days 10-14)

Fly around the mountains to the Hobbit area of Longmeadow.

## Date: 15/03/09 (day 15)

We meet armed Hobbits on the road, and then are escorted to visit
Valerie, she seems an extremely capable wicca, but she hasn't a clue
otherwise.  We give her the invitation (1000sp).  Sebastian gets some
hot hobbit action, and wangles an invitation to be Valerie's partner
at the coronation.  Hobbits party into the night.

## Date: 16/03/09 (day 16)

We obtain more info on the other personages, and say good-bye to the
Hobbits, and start our long flight round to the eastern side of the
mountains.

## Date: 17-22/03/09 (days 17-22)

Fly around the mountains into the area where we believe Morgan the
Grey's tower to be.

## Date: 23/03/09 (day 23)

Cannot find the tower, we camp for the night and are attacked by some
bandits.  Sin is poisoned.  We interrogate (and loot) the one we
manage to capture and then fly to the tower.  It is a white stone and
of elven design.  Morgan obviously controls flocks (murders) of crows,
and we are hassled by his raven familiar IBite.  Sin is turned briefly
into a sparrow.  We see Morgan and give him his invitation (1500sp).
He offers to get IBite to take a message to Corisova … she will find
us if she wants the invitation.  We fly south along the mountain range
towards the Sweptsands

## Date: 24/03/09 (day 24)

We fly south along the mountain range towards the Sweptsands

## Date: 25/03/09 (day 25)

We fly south along the mountain range towards the Sweptsands.  In the evening Sebastian does an Astrology reading:
Swift as the swift
To the hear sea
From the sun to the set
As it's high in the sky
Sin valiantly guards the sleeping party ALL NIGHT.

## Date: 25/03/09 (day 25)

In the morning Sin sleeps while the Hobbit and Elf laze about.  Midday we fly east in formation searching over the sweptsands.  The country is of sandy dunes with water collecting between each huge dune.  In the evening we land and camp near water.  Sebastian reads the night sky … we should travel perpendicular to the sun ie fly south

## Date: 26/03/09 (day 26)

We get up very early and fly again searching for the tribe of Norion.  We catch sight of a caravan moving across the dunes in the distance and make our presence known.  They approach us, but it turns out they are setting up an attack on Norion and so don't want to let us go until they are ready, we play along with this as the two leaders (an old man (Celestial) and woman (Necromancer) seem very powerful, it is all very sinister.  They assure us we will be able to deliver the message and take us on our word not to ruin their arrangements.  We spend the day hanging around the camp.  

## Date: 27/03/09 (day 27)

We spend the day moving with the caravan, we can see many scouts
coming and going, and at times feel a sinister dark presence (we
figure out later that it is IBite homing in on the fun).  We find out
that Norion is a bully and thug and very very unpleasant.  The best
way to stay alive is to pander to his vanity.  We are encouraged to
"take our message" into Norion's camp (as a diversion) in the early
morning by the offer of magical items, cloth armour for the others and
a protection from heat cloak for Sin.  We power up and go in.

We make a grand entrance as Imperial messengers but Norion won't
personally take the message.  We try to leave using subterfuge, we
pretend the incense burner is a gift, we pour the incense on and try
to escape.  However there follows a string of very bad luck.  Norion
jumps on Mirage and fractures his skull, Mirage is now unconscious on
the ground with Norion's hand around his and hence the incense burner.
Sebastian fumbles at grabbing the sensor, and by this time there are 4
bandits surrounding and attacking Sin who is hitting Norion.
Sebastian manages to touch the burner and make his willpower check,
and we finally manage to lift off.  But Norion and 2 of his bandits
are in the area with us and are taken along too.  Sebastian misses the
smoke hole and Sin only just manages to cut an opening before we get
caught up.  Sebastian concentrates on rejecting the unwanted party (we
think they can be not-included in the items field using a WP check).
Norion attacks Sebastian and Sin attacks Norion and the bandits attack
Sin.  Sin dies heroically protecting the party and Sebastian manages
to aim a boom-stick at Norion who lets go and falls.  IBite catches
him squawking that "it is not his time to die, he must die slowly".
Sebastian lands us near the camp, and IBite leaves Norion with us.
The caravans attack has started and without Norion the battle is won
more easily.  It seems not only this tribe are involved, many others
are present.

We are allowed to give Norion his invitation (2000sp) as he is
tortured almost to death, he is forced to accept the invitation, then
petimorted and skin changed into a snake.  We are to take him back to
the Imperial Court as their reply to the invitation.  We get the
weapons and armour of the two bandits we killed.

## Date: 28-04/04/09 (days 28-34)

We have to stay a week while a herbalist is found and Sin is
resurrected.

## Date: 05/04/09 (day 35)

We fly south and west towards the mountain range towards Bulich and
Highvale.

## Date: 06/04/09 (day 36)

We fly into the foot-hills of the mountains, but cannot find the Orc
hold.  We make camp and Sebastian takes a flight a bit further up to
see if he can see the Vale.  It starts to snow and we hunker down
under a small overhang, Sin unseen and Sebastian hiding in one of
Mirages' rocks.  An ice drake turns up and watches for a while, and
then approaches.  It seems curious but not aggressive (yet).  As the
only visible entity Mirage asks about the ice elf D'Urzi, and the
drake agrees to go and see if he wants the invitation, the drake
returns and says D'Urzi will see us at highvale soon.  The drake makes
it very clear there is to be no flying.  We rest for what remains of
the night.

## Date: 07/04/09 (day 37)

We use the shadow shifting device to advance up the mountain.  We find
the entrance to Bulich's vale but it is late in the evening and so we
camp and rest.  The main keep is wooden with a surrounding palisade
and well above the lower wooded portions of the vale where the main
orc village is situated.  We estimate a population of several hundred
Orcs, and we will need to go through the village to get to the keep!

## Date: 08/04/09 (day 38)

We use the shadow shifting device to reach the entrance to the vale
and bribe our way in past the first set of guards.  On the other side
a drake and rider swoop down to us.  It is the curious drake from the
other day and D'Urzi.  He is extremely pale and has armour that looks
very icy, we give him his invitation (2500sp).  Mirage chats with the
drake, and D'Urzi says he is going into the keep with us (good!).  The
orcs all clear before D'Urzi and we walk unmolested into the keep.  We
find Bulich in his "throne room", he is very old and obviously weak
but attempting to put up a good appearance, which is failing.  He
greets D'Urzi with animosity, it is clear that things are about to
happen (probably the overthrow and killing of Bulich).  We give him
his invitation (3000sp) and take up an offer of accommodation, we leav
the Orc chieftain and elf to their politics. On reaching the offered
accommodation, we notice Corisova's letter is glowing, it turns out
she is the serving woman who has showed us the way.  We give her, her
invitation (3500sp) and are very happy when she departs.

## Date: 09/04/09 (day 39)

We are woken in the morning by the drake scratching at the shutters,
we open them and she tells us we should get going.  Bulichs last stand
has happened.  She offers to give us a ride down to the Blackstone
dwarves!  We forgo breakfast and climb out of the window and onto her
back.  Riding the drake obviously involves some semi-magical form of
transportation as we become faintly insubstantial.  On approaching
Blackstone she becomes insubstantial and leaves us feather falling
onto the mountain top.  We are greeted by Blackstone Dwarves on guard
and told that Tinkermeister is indeed working for them, but in the
lower holds, and we will have to go down.  Sebastian is sick so we
leave him behind to be hauled down by the dwarves in a day and make
our way down the very narrow but well made path to Tinkermeisters
workshops.  We give him his invitation (4000sp)

## Date: 10/04/09 (day 40)

We find accommodation and wait for a day, as the dwarves are changing
guard and they will bring Sebastian down in the afternoon.  Sin has a
days training in unarmed combat.

## Date: 11/04/09 (day 41)

In the morning we prepare to depart, but just before we go Sebastian
holds up the last invitation and says "last chance Varentia", we wait
a minute and then there is a tug of a breese on the invitation,
Sebastian lets it go and it drifts out in front of us in a most
unnatural fashion.  Then, we all feel a gentle tug of air and we
follow the invitation into the trees.  Very shortly we arrive at a
clearing with an exquisite elven fountain, the grass is very green,
the sky is very blue (with high wispy clouds), and the air feels of
spring.  Even worse the ground is consecrated.  Sin puts a finger in
the fountain, and it starts itching, so she wipes her hand on the
grass, then her whole hand starts itching, so she pours dwarven sweet
rum on it and licks the rum off.  Her hand stops itching.  Varenthia
turns up, is mysterious and cryptic and takes her invitation (4500sp),
she then touches the water and both the fountain and her fade away.
We all back away.

We use the recall word, and find ourselves in a column of light within
the Sun Temple.  We are held there for some 15 minutes and a priestess
arrives, we give her the Norian/snake and she gives us our payment
(cold hard cash!).  Then we appear in Brasta, it is just before dawn
on the 12th.
