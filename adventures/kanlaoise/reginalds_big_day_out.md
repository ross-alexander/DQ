# Diary of Events

## 12 Frost - Winter {#frost___winter}

Following a message with [Kanlaoise](Kanlaoise "wikilink") breed slaves
we meet with a pair of Sun Elves. A strong rebel army is causing trouble
in the eastern part of the continent. Their organised, funding and
abilities are well beyond what they expect from a rebel army. Our
employer would like us to identify who is supporting the party and, if
possible, kill the leader.

The evening we are summoned to [Kanlaoise](Kanlaoise "wikilink"), via
an unpleasant ritual and pentagrams, to the basement of a small but
well build building. We are on the eastern coast of the continent on
the edge of the desert. Its hot, really hot. Thank goodness we're
wearing silk garments, tailored by Fizgig. The building resides in a
small bustling coastal town with an unnaturally large stone dock and
small fort.

We fly our that evening, deciding to take a shortcut across the
desert.  With Reginald with us, a county hobbit, we're confident we
wont get lost.

## We hate the Desert (13th Frost) {#we_hate_the_desert_13th_frost}

We land early that morning, unable to locate the oasis marked on the
map. Reginald tried hard, but his rangering skills are failing. We
shelter during the day, suffering the unbearable heat. A block of
darkness helps stop some of the heat, but we spend an uncomfortable
day awaiting the cool of the evening before we continue our journey.

We find ourselves close enough to the edge of the desert and decide to
continue out flight to escape the accursed desert.

## New Friends (14th Frost) {#new_friends_14th_frost}

We land close to a small river and wash away the desert sands. We all
agree not to travel through the desert ever again, or until Reginald
learns more about Rangering.

Were approached by the local malita. They're armed and mounted humans
with not an elf in sight, a very unusual sight for this plane. After
some posturing we agree too escort us back to their village, a small
village with inhabitants living in abodes cut from the hills. We spend
the afternoon on the edge of the river, enjoying the cooling waters
with the locals. I manage to see my bejewelled rapier.

That evening we depart, less a weapon - required for tax, flying along
the north along the edge of the mountain for the evening.

## Travellers (15th Frost) {#travellers_15th_frost}

From our camp sight we shop a few groups moving in the same direction
into the mountains. This is sufficiently suspicious to gain our
interest and we follow for the rest of the day.

The next morning its snowing. Hard. First unbearable heat, now snow -
why did we leaving the city. Another day of following reveals more
groups heading in the same direction and that afternoon we arrive at a
pass guarded by rebel troops. We avoid the troops and make our way
over the pass into the valley and find ourselves faced with an army of
troops, around 20K of all nature of races.

Following a few hours of hunting we locate a vantage point that
overlooks the valley. We settle in and watch.

## The Plan (16th Frost) {#the_plan_16th_frost}

We're all in agreement the Sun Elves are vile people and if we hurt the
army we will make the, more powerful. We decided to try and make contact
with the army organisers. Fizgig and I mingle with the troops and drop a
message into the pockets into those that appear to be senior members of
the army asking them to meet with us that evening.

That evening an unnaturally wild storm rolls in. Howling winds, sleet
and driving rain are our companions for the remainder of the day.
Something is up

## Bad News (17th Frost) {#bad_news_17th_frost}

Much paranoia ensure and we finally meet representatives of the army. We
reveal the presence of spies within their army and make some suggests on
how to send back misinformation. Unfortunately we make no meeting of
minds as the representatives are paranoid and the Sun elves are very
difficult to deceive.

Things fall apart and we flee the valley on shadow wings, with a large
burly orc in pursuit.

## Tourist Trip (17th Frost) {#tourist_trip_17th_frost}

We spend the next three days flying south to the coast and another five
along the coast to the costal town that we began our journey. It's a
longer trip than the desert, but infinitely more plesant.

## Frosty Reception (25th Frost) {#frosty_reception_25th_frost}

Our meeting with the Sun Elves does not go well. We are banished home.

Following a number of divinations we find ourselves each the new owners
of a divine Names that can be used to summon us.
