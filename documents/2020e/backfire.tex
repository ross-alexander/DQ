\begin{Chapter}{Backfire Table}

Extra Fatigue The following effects result in the 
Adept losing extra Fatigue in order to contain the 
Backfire effect. If no Fatigue was expended during 
the cast then there will be no apparent effect. If the 
Adept has insufficient Fatigue, then they lose all 
remaining Fatigue and re-roll on this table for each 
Fatigue point they were unable to expend, with any 
further rolls of Fatigue loss taken as damage due to 
internal injuries.

pended. 

10–16   Fatigue loss equal to twice that already 

expended.

expended.

25  

expended. 
Fatigue loss equal to 5 times that already 
expended.

outcome, since in many cases there will be no 
apparent effect.
