Weight  of  Load  (lbs)  The  mximum  weight,  in  pounds,  that  a  character  can 
carry (excluding clothing worn), to fall into that category. Note:  A mount can 
carry weight for a character while they are riding. 

Max The maximum load, in pounds, that a character can carry for a sustained 
period of time. 

Fatigue  loss  from  Exercise  Tiredness  Fatigue  loss  per  hour  of  encumbered 
exercise, see §4.4. 

Agility  Points  Lost  The  temporary  Agility  Point  loss  suffered  by  a  character 
toting  the  given  weight  in  combat.  Use  the  procedure  in  rule  §4.4  to  use  this 
chart.

The number before the slash indicates movement in miles per day on foot; the number following the slash 
indicates mounted movement (assuming horses). Rates for other animal types must be adjusted by the GM. 
The day assumes a total of 8 hours marching. Effects of adverse weather must be adjudicated by the GM. 
Any paths or roads negative the effect of other terrain, and the Plain movement rates are used. 

(-): Movement type impossible at this exercise rate. 

* In these exercise rate categories, horses’ maximum rates will deteriorate 33% per day. They can travel at 
these rates for approximately 4 consecutive days and then they will die.
