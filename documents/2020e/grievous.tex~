51 Grievous Injury Table 

51 GRIEVOUS INJURY TABLE 

A class weapons do grievous injuries on rolls of 01 
through 20.  
B class weapons do grievous injuries on rolls of 21 
through 80.  
C class weapons do grievous injuries on rolls of 70 
through 00. 
01–05   Congratulations! It’s a bleeder in your 

primary arm! Take 1 Damage Point from 
Endurance immediately and 1 per pulse 
thereafter until the flow is staunched by a 
Healer of Rank 0 or above or you die. 
06–07   Oh no! Your opponent’s weapon has 

08  

entered your secondary arm’s elbow joint 
and the tip has broken off. Take 2 Dam-
age Points immediately from Endurance 
and that arm is useless until the sliver has 
been removed by a Healer of Rank 3 or 
above. Also, increase the chance of infec-
tion by 30. 
A vicious puncture wound in your groin! 
Take 3 Damage Points immediately from 
Endurance and reduce your TMR by 2 
until fully recovered, which will take two 
months. In addition, add 30 to your 
chance of being infected (assuming you 
live long enough for such things to mat-
ter). 

12  

11  

09–10   You have been stabbed in your secondary 
arm. Drop whatever you were holding in 
it and take 2 Damage Points immediately 
from Endurance. It will take a full week 
for the arm to be of any use to you what-
soever. 
Your aorta is severed and you are quite 
dead. Rest assured your companions will 
do their best to console your widow(er). 
A stomach puncture. Nasty. You suffer 3 
Damage Points immediately from Endur-
ance and lose 2 from your TMR until 
fully recovered, which will take two 
months. Also, you are automatically 
stunned for the next pulse (if you aren’t 
already), after which you may recover. 
Add 20 to the chance to be infected. 
Your opponent’s weapon has entered your 
eye. Roll D10. On a roll of 1, the weapon 
has entered your brain and you are dead. 
On a roll of 2–5, your left eye is blinded. 
On a roll of 6–10, your right eye is 
blinded. If you are lucky enough to be 
blinded instead of killed, you have suf-
fered 2 Damage Points to Endurance. In 
addition, a figure who is blind in one eye 
suffers the following subtractions: -1 from 
MD, -2 from PB, -4 from Perception. A 
figure blinded in one eye reduces their 
base chance with any missile or thrown 
weapon by 30. 

13  

14–18   Tsk, tsk. A wound of the solid viscera. 
Usually fatal. Take 3 Damage Points to 
Endurance immediately and 1 per pulse 
thereafter until the bleeding is stopped by 
a Healer of Rank 2 or above or you die. 
Add 30 to the chance of infection. 

19–20   Take a stab in the leg (your choice as to 

which one) resulting in a deep puncture of 
the thigh muscle. Suffer 1 Damage Point 
to Endurance immediately and reduce 
your TMR by 1 until you heal, which will 
take 4 weeks. 

21–25   A chest wound. Take 2 Damage Points to 
Endurance immediately and reduce your 
TMR by 1 until recovered (about 2 
months). Look on the bright side, though. 
Your attacker’s weapon is caught in your 
rib cage and has been wrenched from 
their grasp. 

26–27   Bad luck! Your secondary hand has been 

75–80   A massive chest wound accompanied by 

severed at the wrist. Take 2 Damage 
Points to Endurance immediately and 1 
point per pulse from Fatigue thereafter 
(Endurance when Fatigue is exhausted) 
until you are dead or the bleeding is 
staunched by a Healer of Rank 0 or 
above. If you live, reduce your MD by 2. 
28–30   Worst luck! Your primary hand has been 

severed. See result 26–27 for effects. 
31–34   A minor wound. Your face is slashed 

open, ruining your boyish good looks and 
causing blood to spurt into your eyes. 
Reduce your PB by 4 permanently. 
Your secondary arm is sliced off at the 
shoulder. Take 5 Damage Points immedi-
ately from Endurance and 1 per pulse 
thereafter from Fatigue (Endurance when 
Fatigue is exhausted) until you are dead 
or the bleeding is staunched by a Healer 
of Rank 1 or above. Reduce your MD by 
2 and your AG by 1. 
The same as 35, except it’s your good 
primary arm that has been lopped off. 

35  

36  

37–40   You have been eviscerated! Take 4 Dam-
age Points immediately from Endurance 
and 1 point per pulse from Fatigue there-
after (Endurance when Fatigue is ex-
hausted) until you are unconscious. In-
crease your chance of infection by 40. 

broken ribs and crushed tissues. Very 
ugly, this. Take 5 Damage Points imme-
diately from Endurance. Reduce your MD 
and AG by 3 each until this wound heals 
(which should take about 4 months). 
Increase your chance of infection by 10. 
81–84   A crushing blow smashes tissue and pro-

duces internal injuries. You suffer 2 
Damage Points immediately to Endurance 
and 1 per pulse thereafter to Fatigue (En-
durance when Fatigue is exhausted) until 
unconscious or you receive the attention 
of a Healer of Rank 2 or above. 

85–87   A jarring blow to your primary shoulder 
inflicts 2 Damage Points immediately to 
Endurance. Roll D10; the result is the 
number of pulses the arm is useless. You 
immediately drop anything held in that 
hand. 

88–89   Similar to 85–87 except it is your secon-

dary shoulder. 

90–92   Your right hip is smashed horribly. Take 
5 Damage Points immediately to Endur-
ance and fall prone. You will be unable to 
walk until the damage has healed (which 
should take about 6 months). Good fun. 
When healed, you will still have a limp 
which will reduce your TMR by 1 and 
your AG by 2. 

41–42   A glancing blow lays open your scalp and 

93–94   The same as 90–92 except it is your left 

hip that is smashed. 

95–97   Your opponent’s weapon has come crash-
ing down on your head and fractured your 
skull. You fall prone and are unconscious, 
and take 8 Damage Points to Endurance. 
If you survive, you lose 2 from AG, 2 
from MD and 2 from Perception. It will 
take a year in bed to recover. 
Crushing blow to your pelvis breaks bone 
and tears tissue. Take 7 Damage Points 
immediately to Endurance and fall prone. 
Make a WP check to avoid falling uncon-
scious. If you survive, you will be unable 
to move for D10 months. 

98–
100  

Notes 

The  suggested  recovery  times  are  a  guideline  for 
the GM to use in determining how long characters 
should be kept out of action. The actions of a com-
petent  Healer  may  alter  these  times  in  some  in-
stances. 

These  Grievous  Injuries  are  designed  for  combat 
between  human-sized  opponents;  any 
injuries 
sustained  involving  larger  monsters  should  be 
applied judiciously by the GM, taking into account 
size  and  mass  differences,  etc.  In  some  situations, 
the  GM  may  have  to disallow  the  Grievous  Injury 
or change its effects. 

 

 

43  

severs one ear (your choice as to which 
one). Take 2 Damage Points immediately 
from Endurance. Reduce your Perception 
by 2. 
A savage slash rips open your cheek and 
jaw. Take an automatic pass action next 
pulse due to the shock of the blow. Your 
PB is increased by 1, since your disfig-
urement will bring out the mater-
nal/paternal instincts in the opposite gen-
der. 

44–50   A slash along one arm, and it’s a bleeder! 
Take 2 Damage Points immediately from 
Endurance and lose 1 point from Fatigue 
(Endurance when Fatigue is exhausted) 
each pulse until the bleeding is stopped by 
a Healer of Rank 1 or above or you die. 

51–52   Hamstrung! Roll D10. On a roll of 1–4, it 
is your left leg. On a roll of 5–10 it is your 
right. Take 4 Damage Points immediately 
from Endurance and fall prone. You may 
not stand unassisted until the wound is 
healed (which should take three months). 
Reduce your AG by 3 permanently. 

53–60   Your primary arm is crippled by a wicked 
slash! Take 2 damage Points immediately 
to Endurance and drop anything you have 
in your primary hand. The arm is unus-
able until healed, which should take 2 
months. 

61–67   Your secondary arm is crippled; see 53–

60 for details. 

68–69   A nasty slash in the region of the shoulder 
and neck. Roll D10. On a roll of 1–3, your 
head is severed and your corpse tumbles 
to the ground. On a roll of 4–6, your 
secondary collar bone is crushed; on a roll 
of 7–10 your primary collar bone is 
crushed. If your collar bone is crushed, 
the results are identical to 53–60, except 
you suffer 4 Damage Points to Endurance. 
70–74   A crushing blow smashes your helmet and 

causes a concussion. Take 3 Damage 
Points from Endurance and suffer a reduc-
tion of 4 in both MD and AG lasting for 3 
days.

52 FUMBLE TABLES 

52 Fumble Tables 

When an attacker fumbles, they lose 10 from their 
Initiative  Value  until  the  end  of  the  next  pulse. 
Then they make a totally unmodified D100 roll.  If 
that roll is under their current Initiative Value, they 
suffer  no  further  penalty  for  their  slight  fumble;  if 
it  is  not under  their  current  Initiative  Value,  apply 
the corresponding result from the appropriate table 
below. See (§6.10). 

52.1 Consequences 
A  broken  weapon  is  useless until  repaired;  a  shat-
tered weapon is useless until reforged. Any combat 
spell on a broken or shattered weapon is dissipated. 

A  damaged  weapon  is  bent,  dented,  nicked,  or 
similarly  flawed.  You  may  still  use  the  damaged 
weapon but it does 1–2 points less damage and has 
0–20 penalty to its strike chance (GM decides these 
figures), until repaired. 

A damaged magical weapon must be repaired by a 
Weaponsmith  of  at  least  Rank  6.  A  damaged 
weaponsmithed  weapon  loses  all  its  weaponsmith 
bonuses  to  Strike  chance  and/or  Damage,  until 
repaired. 

Any  self-inflicted  damage  ignores  your  armour 
(including  magic);  it  usually  represents  bruising, 
minor  strains,  etc.  Naturally,  take  EN  damage  if 
you  have  no  FT  available.  If  a  specific  injury  is 
stated (e.g. pulled groin muscle, or broken bones), 
then healing requires a lot of time or the appropri-
ate minimum rank of Healer. 

52.2 Special cases 

An innately magical weapon  

• ignores asterisked results (*).  
• does not break.  
• may shatter or be damaged, but less often.  
• does not include any non-magical weapon merely 
under the effects of magic. 

Unarmed Combat  

•  “Shattered” = broken bone(s); lose 2 EN; useless 
in combat until healed.  
•  “Broken” = Seriously bruised; lose 2 FT; may be 
used  in  combat,  but  (until  healed)  each  successful 
blow does 2 damage points less to opponent and 2 
FT to yourself.  
•    “Damaged”  =  Ouch!  Lose  2  FT;  no  further  ef-
fect. 

Strike Chance over 100 

If  the  fumble  indicates  a  broken  or  damaged 
weapon, but your modified Strike Chance was over 
100, you have also struck your opponent; roll [Fa-
tigue] damage as normal. 

52.3 Bows and Crossbows only 

01–12  Bowstring snaps and lashes you; lose 2 EN. 

13   Bowstring snaps and lashes you in the eye; 
lose 2 EN; you are blinded in one eye for 3 
weeks or until cured by a Rank 7 Healer. A 
figure who is blind in one eye suffers the 
following subtractions: 1 from MD, 2 from 
PB, 4 from Perception and reduces their 
base chance with any missile or thrown 
weapon by 30. 

14–29  Bowstring snaps; no further penalty. 

30   Traditional Hunting accident. Clumsy re-

lease causes arrow / quarrel to fly towards a 
random “friendly” back in approximately 
the same direction as you were aiming: 
Strike Chance = Weapon BC + weapon 
bonuses + 30 - target’s defence. 

31–33  Clumsy release; bolt/arrow flies wide miss-

ing friends and foes. 

34–36  Brief twinge of pain in your arm or back; 

Lose 1 EN. 

37–39  as per 34-36, but lose 2 EN. 

51–52  Your vigorous swing causes a slight twinge. 

40–59  Dropped bolt or quarrel. 

60–99  Bowstring snaps; no further damage. 

Make 3 × EN or lose 2 FT. 

53   Make 3 × EN or pull a groin muscle, lose 2 

FT and have half Base TMR until healed. 

00   Bowstring snaps and lashes you; lose 2 EN. 

54–55  as per 51–52, but make 2 × EN. 

52.4 All Other Weapons 
The  following  results  are  generalised.  Therefore 
the  GM  is  free  to  ignore  or  downgrade  any  result 
which  is  inapplicable  to  a  specific  case.  Some 
outcomes are avoidable through a successful char-
acteristic check. 

01–09  Shattered weapon. 

10  

Shattered weapon; some slivers fly at you, 
potentially causing you a grievous injury — 
roll on the Grievous Injury Table (§51), but 
ignore any result over 13. 

11–12  Shattered weapon, flying splinters; you and 

13  

your opponent(s) lose 1 EN each. 
Playing the Roman fool? You just did your-
self an Endurance blow; fortunately you 
rolled minimum damage (but don’t forget 
the extra damage from poison, magic, etc). 

14–16  Your wild swing possibly connects with 

someone other than your intended target or 
yourself – immediately make a strike check 
at your new victim, the nearest being in 
range other than you or your intended target. 
Hope you weren’t mounted. 

17–18  Lose 1 EN. Feels as if you pulled some-

thing. 

56  

as per 53, but make 2 × EN. 

57–58  as per 51-52, but make 1 × EN. 

59  

as per 53, but make 1 × EN. 

60   No effect unless you used a A or B-class 
melee weapon against an opponent with a 
non-magical shield. In which case, you have 
spectacularly wedged you weapon into their 
shield. Make 1 × PS to immediately wrench 
your weapon out, or it will be torn from 
your grasp in the fracas. Don’t worry if you 
fail — perhaps their shield is now useless? 

61–62  Your melee weapon is stuck, caught, or 

entangled in your opponent’s armour or gear 
(and you didn’t even hurt them). Make 3 × 
PS to immediately disengage your weapon, 
or it will be yanked from your grasp in the 
fracas. 

63   You palpably hit a tree, rock, wall-hanging, 
furniture, or some other adjacent “scenery”. 
Make 3 × PS to immediately disen-
gage/extract your weapon. You may try 
again, as a future action; but perhaps you 
should prepare a new weapon instead. 

64–65  as per 61-62, but make 2 × PS. 

66  

as per 63, but make 2 × PS. 

19   Lose 2 EN. You really pulled something. 

67–68  as per 61-62, but make 1 × PS. 

20   Oops! You’ve flung your weapon in a high 
parabolic arc. Normally a flung or dropped 
weapon falls without hurting anyone — 
however, in this case, it falls on a random 
target, possibly even you, and maybe hurts 
them: Strike Chance = [Weapon’s BC] + 
[magical / weaponsmith bonuses] - [random 
target’s defence]. 

21–26  Butterfingers! Make 3 × MD to avoid your 
weapon flying 2–3 hexes in a random direc-
tion. 

27–28  Klutz! Make 3 × MD to avoid dropping your 

weapon in your hex. 

29   Whoops! You’ve caught your weapon in 

your own armour or gear. You may choose 
to automatically free it in the next pulse, in 
which case you may not attack or cast magic 
until after the end of the next pulse. Or else 
you may wish to prepare another weapon in 
your next action. 

30   Overly enthusiastic lunge. GM moves you to 
an unoccupied forward hex (make 3 × AG to 
choose your new facing) — but if no empty 
hex is available, you just tried to close on an 
opponent, who gets a free chance to keep 
you out of close. If you did close, you don’t 
have to drop any non-close weapon, but it 
may not be used to attack effectively. 

31–32  Poor balance; make 3 × AG or no offensive 

action until after the end of the next pulse. 
Stumble; make 3 × AG or fall prone. 

33  

34–35  as per 31–32, but make 2 × AG. 

36  

as per 33, but make 2 × AG. 

37–38  as per 31–32, but make 1 × AG. 

39  

as per 33, but make 1 × AG. 

40   Broken weapon. 

41–49  Damaged weapon. 

50   Momentary dizziness; make 3 × EN or you 
may not attack or cast magic until after the 
end of next pulse. 

69  

as per 63, but make 1 × PS. 

70*   Shattered weapon, if it is not at least Rank 1 

71–
73*  

weaponsmithed. 
Your weapon breaks unless you roll under 
its weaponsmith rank on D10. Indeed it 
shattered if you failed the roll by 5 or more. 

74–77  Twinge of pain. Take (D10 - rank in 

weapon) FT damage. 

78–79  as per 74–77, but also you may not attack or 

cast magic for remainder of the pulse. 

80   Your weapon flies from your grasp. You 

may choose to drop whatever is in your 
other hand; in which case, make 3 × MD to 
catch the weapon in that other hand. 

81–82  Butterfingers! Make 3 × MD to avoid your 
weapon flying 2–3 hexes in a random direc-
tion. 

83   Klutz! Make 3 × MD to avoid dropping your 

weapon in your hex. 

84–85  as per 81-82, but make 2 × MD. 

86  

as per 83, but make 2 × MD. 

87–88  as per 81–82, but make 1 × MD. 

89  

as per 83, but make 1 × MD. 

90   Broken weapon. 

91–99  Damaged weapon. 

00   Your bizarre but highly spectacular fumble 

is mistaken for an obscure martial technique. 
All engaged melee opponents hastily elect to 
neither attack or cast magic as their next 
action. If you have another action before 
they actually perform their next action, you 
may choose to run away (retreat up to full 
TMR) as your action without the need for a 
Withdrawal manoeuvre — you are no longer 
engaged with those particular opponents.
