\Chapter{Ranking}

Experience  points  are  required  to  advance  in  any-
thing.  Time  spent  training  is  required  to  increase 
proficiency  in  spells,  skills  and  weapons.  Adven-
turing time is required to advance in characteristics 
and talents. 

EP is spent as per below but note the following.  

•  Talents  may  be  ranked  only  once  per  game  ad-
venturing week.  

•  Weapon  skills  take  1  week  of  training  to  reach 
Rank  0,  and  2  weeks  ×  (rank  to  be  achieved)  to 
improve.  

• Skill ranks 8, 9, and 10 must be ratified by a GM 
and in general required significant use of the skill.  

•  The  character  may  rank  any  combination  of  two 
things  at  the  same  time,  providing  the  character 
does  not  rank  magic  (i.e.  spells  or  rituals)  at  the 
same time as non-magic (i.e. weapons or skills).  

•  Time  spent  training  for  a  particular  rank  of  an 
ability may be interrupted by other activity (includ-
ing  being  on  adventure).  However  training  for  a 
given  rank  must  be  resumed  within  6  months  of 
starting training for that rank.  

•  Namers  may  rank  1  name  in  addition  to  other 
forms of ranking. They may also substitute ranking 
names  for  ranking  any  single  magical  or  non-
magical ability; ie Namers may rank 1 name while 
learning  two  related  abilities,  2  names  with  one 
ability  or,  if  doing  no  other  ranking,  3  names  at 
once. 

All adventurers can learn any skill or weapon, and 
any magic within their college. Learning costs EP, 
time  and  money.  The  following  can  be  ranked: 
Skills,  Weapons,  Spells,  and  Languages,  Names, 
Rituals, Talents, Adventuring Skills and Character-
istics. 

3.1 Characteristics 
A Characteristic may only be raised by five points 
over its starting value to a maximum of 25 (modi-
fied  by  racial bonuses  / penalties),  except  Fatigue, 
and Physical Beauty (which cannot be raised). The 
exception to this is Perception, which can be raised 
to racial maximum. 

To  calculate  the  maximum  for  Fatigue,  take  the 
racial maximum for Endurance and find the maxi-
mum  Fatigue  (see  table  §1.1).  For  example,  orcs 
have +1 to EN so their maximum EN is 26, hence 
their maximum FT is 24 from the chart. Then apply 
any additional racial modifiers to FT. For example, 
orcs  gain  +2  to  FT  so  their  maximum is  24  + 2  = 
26. 

A  characteristic  may  only  be  increased  once  per 
adventuring  session  (if  a  session  took  more  than 
the normal session length, then this rule should be 
applied appropriately). If a character did not adven-
ture  during  a  session  then  they  cannot  raise  any 
characteristics,  and  if  they  participated  on  more 
than  one  adventure  during  the  session,  then  they 
can  still  only  raise  a  characteristic  by  one.  Any  or 
all  of  the  characteristics  may  be  raised  simultane-
ously if permissible. 

If  a  character  has  lost  characteristic points  for  any 
reason, they may buy back as many points as they 
wish in addition to any 

normal increase. The cost of buying a characteristic 
point back is the same as buying an extra point (see 
table §55.3). 

3.2 Talents 
For each week of actual, out in the field, adventur-
ing,  you  can  rank  each  of  your  talents  once.  No 
training  time  is  required  to  rank  Talents.  Like 
Spells and Rituals, each Talent has an EM. No MA 
discounts apply to any Talents. 

3.3 Spells 
If you are an Adept (i.e. cast magic), you can rank 
your  spells.  Each  spell  has  an  EM,  or  Experience 
Multiplier. This is multiplied by the Rank that you 
wish  to  achieve,  to  give  a  total  EP  cost.  If  the 
Adept  has  MA  >  15,  (MA  -  15)  ×  5%  of  the  EP 
cost of General Spells may be discounted. Training 
time  for  spells  is  (Rank  to  be  achieved)  days. 
Learning  a  new  spell  to  Rank  0  takes  (EM  /  100 
rounded  up  +  1)  weeks,  but  no  experience  points. 
See  the  Players  Guide  for  availability  of  special 
knowledge  spells.  You  cannot  have  more  spells 
and rituals below rank 6 than your MA characteris-
tic. Rank 20 is the Maximum Rank achievable with 
any Spell. 

3.4 Rituals 
Rituals are learnt and ranked just like spells, except 
that Ranking time is (Rank to be achieved)  weeks, 
rather  than  days.  MA  discount  applies  to  General 
Knowledge Rituals. 

3.5 Skills 
All  skills  are  assumed  to  be  unranked  (i.e.  un-
known)  initially.  The  first  level  of  competence  is 
Rank  0,  and  will  take  eight  weeks  to  learn.  Each 
subsequent rank will take that number of weeks to 
reach (eg. to get to Rank 7 from Rank 6 will take 7 
weeks). The EP cost for ranking each Skill is listed 
in table §55.2. Some skills require minimum Char-
acteristic  requirements  to  Rank,  or  impose  EP 
penalties  (or  discounts)  for  exceptional  Character-
istics. 

If  the  character  is  taught  by  someone  of  greater 
Rank  in  the  skill,  decrease  any  Experience  Point 
cost  by  10%.  If  the  character  learns  from  a  book 
(the availability of  which is up to the GM), verbal 
descriptions or practices with someone of equal or 
lesser Rank in the skill, any Experience Point cost 
is  unmodified.  If  the  character  practices  with  no 
useful  outside  assistance,  any  Experience  Point 
cost is increased by 25%. If training is done at the 
Guild,  it  costs  150sp  ×  (Rank  to  be  achieved, 
minimum 1). 

Some  skills  include  specific  abilities  (subskills) 
which  are  learnt  when  increasing  your  rank  in  the 
skill. It is possible in some skills to learn subskills 
by  spending  time  and  EP  without  increasing  your 
rank. Knowledge has a one-off cost. In both cases, 
see table §55.2 and each skill concerned. 

Achieving Ranks 8, 9 and 10 is difficult. You must 
find  and  complete  a  special  task  relating  to  your 
skill (although of less stature in the case of Artisan 
skills),  with  the  assistance  of  a  GM,  for  each  of 
these  Ranks.  Rank  10  is  the  maximum  achievable 
Rank in all Skills. 

3.6 Adventuring Skills 
Adventuring  Skills  are  skills  used  every  day  by 
adventurers  to  survive,  and  thus  are  continually 
honed.  These  skills  include  Horsemanship,  Swim-
ming, Flying, Stealth and Climbing. 

If  you  have  extensively  used  an  adventuring  skill 
while on adventure, you may rank this skill without 
any time requirements. Otherwise, Ranking time is 
as per normal skills. 

Adventurers  are  assumed  to  start  off  with  Rank  0 
or  more  in  all  these  skills,  unless  specifically  told 
otherwise. The EP cost for ranking each Adventur-
ing  Skill  is  listed  in  table  §55.2.  The  maximum 
rank in each of these Skills is 10. No special task is 
required for Rank 8 and above. 

3.7 Languages 
Languages  have  the  same  time  requirement  as 
normal skills, except that the time for Rank 0 in a 
language  is  only  1  week,  and  no  special  task  is 
required for Rank 8 and above. 

The  undiscounted  EP  costs  are  set  out  in  Table 
§55.2.  Note  that  knowing  related  languages  or  the 
Philosopher  Skill  may  grant  an  EP  discount.  The 
maximum  total  EP  discount  applicable  is  50%, 
regardless  of  how  many  individual  discounts  are 
available to the character. 

3.8 Weapons 
All  weapons  are  assumed to  be  unranked initially. 
Rank 0 in a weapon takes 1 week. All higher ranks 
take  2  ×  Rank  weeks.  Weapons  have  individual 
maximum  Ranks.  EP  costs  are  detailed  in  55.1 
Weapons.  All  Weapons  require  minimum  PS  and 
MD  Characteristics.  If  you  do  not  fulfil  both  re-
quirements, you may not rank a weapon. You may 
not get an EP discount for training, but if no trainer 
is  available,  you  may  not  increase  in  Rank.  The 
cost of a trainer is 10 × Rank squared (minimum 

1) silver pennies. 

3.9 Names 
Anyone  can  learn  Names,  but  only  Namers  can 
Rank  them  beyond  Rank  0.  Once  acquired,  an 
Individual  or  Generic  Name  may  be  studied  and 
fully  learnt.  For  Ranking  Names  beyond  Rank  0 
see the College of Naming Incantations (§17.3).  

•  Learning  a  Name  replaces  ranking  any  other 
single magical or non-magical ability.  

•  Generic  Names  take  one  day  of  study  to  be 
learned (i.e. Rank 0).  

•  Individual  Names  take  one  week  of  study  to  be 
learned.
