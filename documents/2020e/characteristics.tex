\begin{Chapter}{Explanation of Characteristics}

This  section  is  an  explanation  of  a  character’s 
characteristics and how they are used in the game. 

All  characteristics  are  calculated  when  the  charac-
ter  is  generated  but  Adventurers  in  a  world  of 
magic  can  expect  them  to  change  from  time  to 
time.  A  “temporary”  change  indicates  an  increase 
or  decrease  of  limited  duration  to  the  value  of  a 
characteristic;  a  “permanent”  change  indicates  an 
increase  or  decrease  of  indefinite  duration  to  the 
value of a characteristic. 

The first six characteristics are the primary charac-
teristics.  These  can  be  increased  temporarily  by 
magic  or  permanently  by  training  (expenditure  of 
experience points), and can be decreased temporar-
ily by magic or injury, or permanently by injury to 
the  character.  These  primary  characteristics  can 
never  be  trained  more  than  5  above  their  starting 
value, and never above racial maximum, except by 
unusual magical means. 

All other characteristics are secondary characteris-
tics. The manner in which a secondary characteris-
tic can be changed will be covered in the appropri-
ate explanation. 

Generally,  a  high  characteristic  value  indicates  a 
character’s  ability  to  perform  a  certain  task  well, 
while a  low value indicates a relative lack of such 
ability.  A  characteristic’s  effect  is  almost  always 
translated into numerical terms for the purposes of 
resolving action during play. Adventurers generally 
have  higher  characteristics  than  normal  people  in 
the world, that is what makes them heroes after all. 

Effects of Characteristics 

A  character  develops  specific  skills  during  the 
game, and their characteristics influence their base 
chances  with  these  skills.  However  there  are  also 
many  feasible  tasks  that  a  character  may  wish  to 
perform  without  having  a  specific  skill  to  do  so. 
The  GM then uses the most appropriate character-
istic to generate a base chance to perform that task. 

Difficulty Factors (Characteristic Multipliers) 

When  a  player  declares  that  their  character  will 
attempt  a  task  which  the  GM  acknowledges  as 
dependent upon a particular characteristic, the GM 
assigns  the  task  a  difficulty  factor.  This  difficulty 
factor will be a number from 1/2 through to 5. 

The greater the difficulty factor value, the easier a 
task will be to perform. 

The  player  multiplies  the  difficulty  factor  by  the 
appropriate  characteristic,  arriving  at  the  percent-
age  chance  of  the  character  performing  the  task. 
The maximum base chance is (70 + characteristic + 
difficulty  factor)%.  The  player  then  rolls  D100, 
and if the roll is less than or equal to the percentage 
then  the  character  has  successfully  performed  the 
task.  If  the  roll  is  greater  than  the  percentage,  the 
character has failed.  If the roll fails  by at least the 
value of the characteristic or exceeds the maximum 
base chance, the character has failed miserably and 
may  have  injured  themselves.  The  GM  may  wish 
to determine the extent of the injury by how much 
the roll exceeds the percentage plus the characteris-
tic. 

2.1 Strength (PS) 
Physical  Strength  is  a  measure  of  a  character’s 
muscle  coordination  and  strength.  The  Physical 
Strength  characteristic  represents  the  brute  force  a 
character  can  exert  from  the  thews  of  their  arms, 
the  thrusting  power  of  their  leg  muscles,  and their 
lift and weight capacity. 

Specific Influences  

• Effects of weight carried  

• Minimum PS requirement for weapons  

• Damage 

Generic Uses  

• Breaking objects  

• Lifting heavy or awkward objects 

Example 
Consider  the  sturdiness  of  the  object  and 
the  implement  being  used  to  break  it  for  the  former,  and 
consider  the  weight  and  bulk  of  the  object  plus  the  pur-
chase afforded the character for the latter. 

2.2 Manual Dexterity (MD) 
Manual  Dexterity  is  a  measure  of  a  character’s 
control  with  their  hands.  The  Manual  Dexterity 
characteristic  represents  the  character’s  hand-to-
eye co-ordination, the speed at which the character 
can  perform  a  complex  task  with  their  hands,  and 
the ability to manipulate their hands. 

Specific Influences  

• Minimum MD requirement for weapons  

• Thievery  

• Strike Chance in Combat 

Generic Uses  

• Handling dangerous substances  

• Fine handicrafts \& other delicate tasks. 

Example 
Consider  the  delicacy  of  the  task  when  a 
character seeks the careful  manipulation or removal of an 
object. 

2.3 Agility (AG) 
Agility  is  a  measure  of  a  character’s  ability  to 
manoeuvre  their  whole  body  and  their  speed  of 
movement.  The  Agility  characteristic  represents 
the  character’s  litheness  of  body,  the  speed  at 
which  the  character  can  run,  and  their  ability  to 
dodge with or contort their body. 

Specific Influences  

• Tactical Movement Rate  

• Speed in combat  

• Defence  

• Most physical skills 

Generic Uses  

• Manoeuvring 

Example 
Consider  speed,  distance,  and  complexity 
of the manoeuvre, as well as the nature of any obstacles or 
features they are using. 

2.4 Magical Aptitude (MA) 
Magic Aptitude is a measure of a character’s abil-
ity  to  harness  and  direct  magical  energies.  The 
Magic  Aptitude  characteristic  represents  the  char-
acter’s  control  over  the  flow  of  mana  (the  stuff  of 
magic),  and  their  ability  to  remember  spells  and 
rituals. 

Specific Influences  

•  Magic  Colleges  have  a  minimum  MA  require-
ment  

• Cost of training magic  

• Base chances of magical skills 

Generic Uses  

• Noticing arcane mana effects 

2.5 Willpower (WP) 
Willpower is a measure of a character’s self control 
of mind and body, especially in stressful situations. 
The  Willpower  characteristic  represents  a  charac-
ter’s ability to concentrate, their ability to resist the 
imposition  of  another’s  will  upon  their  own,  and 
the  degree  to  which  their  will  can  be  used  to 
counter  their  instincts  (when,  for  instance,  the 
character  might  be  attempting  an  action  which 
could be suicidal). 

Specific Influences  

• Magic resistance  

• Fear resistance  

• Concentration checks to perform magic  

• Recovering from being stunned

Generic Uses  

• Resisting suffering  

• Persevering with boring or dangerous tasks 

2.6 Endurance (EN) 
Endurance  is  a  measure  of  the  punishment  a char-
acter’s  body  can  absorb  before  the  character  be-
comes  unconscious,  sustains  mortal  wounds,  or 
dies.  The  Endurance  characteristic  represents  the 
character’s  capacity  to  withstand  wounds,  their 
resistance to disease and infection and their rate of 
recovery  from  same,  and  directly  affects  their 
ability to over-exert themselves. 

Specific Influences  

• Starting Fatigue  

• Damage capacity  

• Stunning from damage 

Generic Uses  

• Resisting poison, infection \& disease 

2.7 Fatigue (FT) 
Fatigue  is  a  measure  of  a  character’s  physical  and 
mental  fitness.  The  Fatigue  characteristic  repre-
sents  the  degree  to  which  the  character  can  exert 
themselves  before  becoming  exhausted,  the  num-
ber of minor cuts and bruises they can take before 
their  abilities  are  affected,  and  the  mental  energy 
that  can  be  used  to  cast  spells.  This  characteristic 
directly reflects a character’s current level of tired-
ness as it is reduced temporarily with any strenuous 
activity  and  restored  to  normal  with  rest.  Fatigue 
may  be  permanently  increased  by  training  up  to  5 
points or to racial maximum. 

Specific Influences  

• Sustained activity  

• Minor damage capacity  

• Spell casting energy 

Generic Uses  

• Ignoring cold  

• Coping with missing meals or sleep 

2.8 Physical Beauty (PB) 
Physical Beauty is a measure of a character’s exte-
rior  attractiveness  (or  repulsiveness)  as  perceived 
by  the  humanoid  races.  Physical  Beauty  is  a  char-
acteristic  representing  a  character’s  appearance 
compared  to  the  aesthetic  standards  of  the  main 
sentient  races.  It  is  in  no  way  a  reflection  of  a 
character’s  personality.  Specific  reactions  to  PB 
are  also  influenced  by  the  observer’s  race  and 
gender.  The  Physical  Beauty  values  for  monsters 
describe  how  that  monster  appears  to  a  character, 
and not to another monster of the same race. Physi-
cal Beauty can be increased or decreased temporar-
ily by magic, and decreased permanently by disfig-
urement. It cannot be increased by training. 

Specific Influences  

• Reaction rolls 

Generic Uses  

• Influencing NPCs 

2.9 Perception (PC) 
Perception  is  a  measure  of  a  character’s  intuition 
developed as a result of their experience. The Per-
ception  characteristic  represents  the  character’s 
ability  to  note  peculiarities  in  a  given  situation, 
their ability to deduce a person’s habits or customs 
from  scant  information,  and  their  general  knowl-
edge of the world. 

The Perception value can be increased or decreased 
temporarily,  and  can  be  increased  permanently 
through  training  up  to  racial  maximum.  Magic, 
certain  natural  or  alchemical  preparations,  and  the 
character’s  condition  can  cause  a  temporary  in-
crease or decrease in the Perception value. 

Specific Influences  

• Detecting ambushes or traps  

• Detecting hidden things  

• Initiative 

Generic Uses  

•  Picking  up  information  from  conversation  or 
observation  

• Peripheral vision  

• Noticing things out of the ordinary  

• Remembering vague information  

•  Making  connections  between  new  clues  and 
previous knowledge 

2.10 Tactical Movement Rate (TMR) 
The Tactical Movement Rate is the fastest speed a 
character can move in combat. A character’s Tacti-
cal  Movement  Rate  (TMR)  characteristic  is  based 
on  their  Agility  and  influenced  by  any  weight 
carried or restricting clothing. It may be temporar-
