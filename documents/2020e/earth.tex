\begin{Chapter}{The College of Earth Magics (Ver 1.2)}

The College of Earth Magics is concerned with the shaping of the
powers of the earth itself and of those entities and things that are
rooted in the earth or in contact with it.

There are two distinct branches of this College, and 
a  practitioner  of  Earth  Magic  college  can  be  a 
member  of  only  one  branch  at  a  time.  They  may 
alter  their affiliation, but  are  treated as  if  they  had 
quit their original branch and lost all knowledge of 
Earth  Magic  until  such  time  as  they  has  spent  six 
months in study and meditation to relearn the Gen-
eral Knowledge of the College in a new form. The 
two divisions of this College are: 

Pacifistic  Earth  Magic  Usually  practiced  by  wild 
people who live in isolation in the wilderness,  this 
type  of  Earth  Magic  is  very  powerful,  but  entirely 
defensive in nature. An adherent of this division of 
Earth Magic will never attack without provocation 
(i.e.  unless  attacked  themselves  or  unless  they  see 
animals or plants attacked). They are unaffected by 
counterspells  of  their  College  cast  over  an  area 
they  which  occupy  while  attempting  to  work  the 
magic  of  their  College.  In  addition,  the  counter-
spells  of  their  College  give  only  half  the  normal 
benefit  to  characters  attempting  to  resist  their 
magic.  However,  they  may  never  participate  in 
rituals  of  this College  which involve  human  sacri-
fice. 

Druidic  Earth  Magic  This  form  of  Earth  Magic  is 
practiced by strong-willed individuals who have no 
objection  to  the  taking  of  human  life  to  further 
their magic. It is often practiced communally since 
it  is  in  part  ritual  magic.  Many  of  the  rituals  in-
volve courting the darker sides of earth by provid-
ing blood to quench its thirst. 

20.1 Restrictions 
Practitioners  of  the  College  of  Earth  Magics  must 
always  be  in  contact  with  the  earth  to  perform 
magic of this College. 

A  practitioner  of  this  College  is  considered  in 
contact with the earth if they are in contact with an 
item which is, itself, rooted in the earth (tree, plant, 
foundation of a house, etc.). They  would not be in 
contact with earth if they were in the air or in water 
where they could not touch bottom, or if they were 
atop a  piece  of  furniture  or  an  animal  as  these  are 
not  rooted  in  the  ground.  An  Adept  in  a  person’s 
arms is not in contact with the earth. 

The MA requirement of this College is 15. 

20.2 Base Chance Modifiers 
The  following  numbers  are  added  to  the  Base 
Chance  of  performing  any  talent,  spell  or  ritual  of 
the College of Earth Magics. 

+5 
-20 

Adept is wearing a sprig of fresh mistletoe 
Adept is in contact with earth, but beneath 
water† 
Adept is in a manmade dwelling without an 
earthen floor 
Adept occupies a place of power‡ 
+20 
†For example, beneath the ocean, if the Adept can 
find  a  way  of  breathing  in  such  a  situation,  the 
Adept’s BC would always be reduced by 20. 

-5 

‡These  can  be  any  places  frequented  by  worship-
pers of earth. Examples from mythology and litera-
ture  might  include:  Stonehenge,  Finn  McCool’s 
Seat, The Hill of Tara, etc. If the Place of Power is 
used  for  ritual  sacrifice,  the  practitioners  of  Paci-
fistic Earth Magic would receive no benefit. 

All modifiers are cumulative. They are in addition 
to the modifiers listed in §7.4. 

20.3 Talents  

Detect Aura (T-1)  

Range: Special 
Experience Multiple: 75 
Base Chance: PC + 5% / Rank 
Resist: Active 

Target: Entity, Object, Area, Volume 
Effects:  The  Base  Chance  is  reduced  by  1%  for 
every foot after the first five feet the target is from 
the Adept. The results of this talent are the same as 
given in §9.1. 

20.4 General Knowledge Spells 

Converse with Animals (G-1) 

Range: 10 feet + 10 / Rank 
Duration: 3 hours + 3 hours / Rank 
Experience Multiple: 50 
Base Chance: 45% 
Resist: None 
Storage: Potion 
Target: Self 
Effects:  The  Adept  may  communicate  with  fauna 
(whether  verbally  or  symbolically,  and  to  what 
extent, are left up to the GM’s discretion). Physical 
contact  between  the  animal  and  the  Adept  in-
creases  the  Base  Chance  of  successfully  casting 
this  spell  by  5.  This  spell  does  not  include  avians 
or fish and has to be recast for each type of animal, 
for  example  talking  to  wolves  does  not  allow  the 
Adept to talk to tigers. 

Converse with Plants (G-2) 

Range: 10 feet + 10 / Rank 
Duration: 3 hours + 3 / Rank 
Experience Multiple: 50 
Base Chance: 25% 
Resist: None 
Storage: Potion 
Target: Self 
Effects:  The  Adept  can  communicate  with  flora 
with which they are familiar. The mode and extent 
of communication is up to the GM’s discretion. 

Controlling Animals (G-3) 

Range: 10 feet + 10 / Rank 
Duration: Concentration: no maximum 
Experience Multiple: 100 
Base Chance: 20% 
Resist: Passive 
Storage: Investment 
Target: Animal 
Effects:  The  Adept  controls  the  actions  of  any 
animal  that  does  not  successfully  resist.  It  will 
serve them so long as they continue to concentrate. 
If  they  release  the  animal  or  their  concentration  is 
broken,  it  may  attack  them  or  flee.  The  chance  to 
cast this spell is reduced by 5% if the Adept cannot 
speak to the animal. If the Adept cannot make eye 
contact, the Base Chance is reduced another 5%. 

Blending (G-4) 

Range: 15 feet + 1 / Rank 
Duration: 1 hour + 1 / Rank 
Experience Multiple: 50 
Base Chance: 60% 
Resist: None 
Storage: Investment, Potion, Ward 
Target: Entity 
Effects:  Once  this  spell  is  cast,  the  target  must 
remain  still  in  order  for  it  to  have  effect.  While 
remaining still, the target is not able to be seen by 
non-magical  means  (i.e.  as  for  invisibility).  If  the 
target moves, the spell ceases to work. However, if 
the target becomes still again during the duration of 
the  spell,  it  will  resume  its  effect.  The  duration  of 
the  spell  refers  to  the  time  since  casting,  not  the 
time  that  the  spell  is  actually  in  effect  (i.e.  while 
the target is still). 

Keeping still will require (as a minimum) a 4 × WP 
check  every  hour.  The  target  may  be  required  to 
make  additional  willpower  checks  at  the  GM’s 
discretion. 

The spell only has effect while the target is “still”. 
This means that the target is unable to move any of 
its external surfaces, with limited exceptions. Mov-
ing  an  external  surface  encompasses  such  actions 
as  moving  a  limb,  or  opening  and  closing  the 
mouth.  Blinking  and  normal  bodily  movement 

67 

20 COLLEGE OF EARTH MAGICS 

caused  by  normal  breathing  will  not  constitute 
moving  for  the  purposes  of  this  spell.  The  follow-
ing  actions  will  automatically  cause  the  spell  to 
cease  working:  talking,  spellcasting,  triggering 
(subject  to  any  revision  of  the  Investment  ritual), 
readying  a  weapon,  altering  facing  in  a  hex,  mov-
ing from the hex, using a silent language, or indeed 
any  Action  other  than  a  Pass  action  (and  Pass  ac-
tions  being  restricted  as  outlined).  Note  that  it  is 
not  relevant  if  an  observer  would  see  the  move-
ment  for  the  spell  to  cease  working  (e.g.  moving 
hands  behind  back,  or  talking  behind  hand  will 
both cause the spell to cease having an effect). 

Walking Unseen (G-5) 

Range: 1 foot + 1 / Rank 
Duration: 1 hour + 1 / Rank 
Experience Multiple: 100 
Base Chance: 50% 
Resist: None 
Storage: Investment, Potion, Ward 
Target: Entity 
Effects:  The  target  of  this  spell  may  move  unno-
ticed,  not  invisible.  This  means  that  it  will  not 
transmit light. As a consequence the target will cast 
a  shadow  (which  may  or  may  not  be  noticed  de-
pending on the lighting etc — even if noticed may 
not  be  connected  to  the  target)  and  have  a  reflec-
tion  in  a  mirror  (or  any  reflective  surface).  How-
ever  the  target  may  not be noticed  even  if  another 
entity  is  looking  directly  at  him/her.  It  should  be 
noted  that  a  crystal  of  vision  or  similar  would 
count  as  looking  directly  at  the  target,  not  as  a 
reflection.  An  entity  will  get  a  perception check if 
the target becomes invasive on that entity’s senses 
(e.g. standing in a frontal adjacent hex, or standing 
behind  the  entity  with  the  target’s  hands  over 
his/her eyes). Although the target is not invisible, it 
may  be  detected  using  any  magical  means  for 
detecting invisible entities (e.g. witchsight). 

If  the  target  of  the  spell  be  touched  by  another 
entity, or that entity’s possessions, then the spell is 
broken.  The  target  of  the  spell  may  not  break  it 
voluntarily  (other  than  by,  for  example,  touching 
another  entity).  Once  broken  the  spell  must  be 
recast.

due  to  disease  or  injury.  The  spell  takes  about  5 
minutes to cast.

20 COLLEGE OF EARTH MAGICS 

to  detect  poison.  When  the  wand  is  touched  to  an 
object  or  substance  for  5  seconds,  the  wand  will 
momentarily  turn  black  if  poison  is  present.  The 
wand  may  be  used  to  check  up  to  1  (+  1  /  Rank) 
objects  or  substances. By  the  shading  and patterns 
of  the  wand,  further  information  may  be  deter-
mined about the poison based on rank: 

Origin (Mineral, Plant, Animal, Magic) 

Rank 8+  Type (Alchemical or Natural) 
Rank

on every percentile dice roll in which the character 
is directly involved. This spell cannot be cast over 
oneself.  The  duration  of  the  enchantment  is  as 
follows: Ranks 1–10 = a fortnight, Ranks 11–19 =

Experience Multiple: 75 
Base Chance: 25% 
Resist: None 
Storage: Potion

the  duration  of  the  spell.  It  also  increases  their 
chance  of  finding  herbs  (as  per  the  Herbalist  or

already  ranked  in  Herbalist  or  Ranger,  then  they 
gain an additional +10%.

Each hand is 7 feet tall and all must be contiguous 
to each other. They may clutch anything that enters 
the  hex  they  occupy  and  will  continue  to  do  so 
until  they  have  caught  something.  Any  entity 
standing  on  a  spot  where  a  hand  materialises  will 
be  snatched  up  if  they  fail  to  resist,  otherwise  the 
hand  appears  next  to  them  within  the  hex.  Any 
entity caught will still be able to wield a weapon or 
cast if they roll under 2 × MD. Entities (or combi-
nation  of  entities)  with  a  combined  PS  +  target’s 
AG greater than 40 (+ 2 / Rank) may attempt a 1 ×

Duration: 1 day + 1 / Rank 
Experience Multiple: 225 
Base Chance: 15% 
Resist: None 
Storage: Investment, Ward 
Target: Plant 
Effects: This spell may impart partial mobility to a 
number  of  plants  (including  trees)  equal  to  the 
Adept’s  Rank.  The  plants  may  not  uproot  them-
selves,  but  may  move  their  branches  and  leaves 
while  remaining  in  the  same  spot.  The  plant’s 
actions  are  always  under  the  control  of  the  Adept 
so  long  as  they  maintain  their  concentration.  If 
their  concentration  is  broken,  voluntarily  or  other-

will last until broken by the animal or dispelled by 
magic. Any animal subject to this spell makes one 
check per week against its Willpower to determine 
if  the  spell  is  broken.  This  only  works  on  land 
animals, it will not work on avians or aquatics.

tal  with  a  combined  Fatigue  and  Endurance  of  15 
(+  5  /  Rank)  appears  within  20  feet  of  the  Adept. 
The  Adept  automatically  casts  a  Spell  of  Control-
ling  Earth  Elemental  to  see  if  they  control  the 
Elemental. The Control spell is a separate spell and 
requires  additional  fatigue  to  cast,  but  does  not 
require  any  preparation  and  is  cast  in  conjunction 
with this spell. 

Controlling Earth Elemental (S-11) 

Range: 20 feet 
Duration: Concentration: no maximum 
Experience Multiple: 225 
Base Chance: 20%

Effects: The  Adept may attempt to control an Ele-
mental  they  have  just  summoned.  The  Elemental 
does  not  get  to  resist.  If  successful  in  establishing 
control  over  the  Elemental,  the  Adept  maintains 
control  until  their  concentration  is  broken  or  they 
banish  the  Elemental  with  a  counterspell.  If  they 
fail to gain control of the Elemental or gain control, 
but have their concentration broken, the Elemental 
will  immediately  attack  them.  The  Adept  cannot 
banish an Elemental they do not control.

This spell may be used to affect multi-hex targets, 
each  hex  of  the  target  counts  as  one  human-sized

fected.

Trollskin (S-16) 

Earth Transformation (S-19) 

Range: 10 feet 
Duration: 30 seconds + 5 / Rank 
Experience Multiple: 250 
Base Chance: 20% 
Resist: None 
Storage: Investment, Potion, Ward 
Target: Entity 
Effects:  The  spell  allows  the  subject  to  regenerate 
Endurance  Points.  The  target  begins  to  regenerate 
the  pulse  after  the  spell  is  cast  and  continues  to 
regenerate  at  the  rate  of  1  Endurance  Point  per 
pulse  for  the  duration  of  the  spell.  The  spell  will 
not  help  regenerate  wounds  inflicted  by  acid  or 
fire.  An  entity  will  not  die  from  damage  while 
under  the  effects  of  a  trollskin,  even  if  they  are 
below negative half Endurance. 

Range: 10 feet + 10 / Rank

Base Chance: 10% 
Resist: Passive 
Storage: Investment, Ward 
Target: Volume 
Effects: This spell turns 3 (+ 1 / Rank) cubic feet of 
stone into mud or vice versa. An entity standing on 
a  spot  containing  a  mud  puddle  that  is  turned  to 
stone  has  an  opportunity  to  passively  resist  the 
effects  of  the  spell.  If  they  fail  to  resist,  they  will 
become  trapped  in  the  stone  that  has  taken  the 
place  of  the  mud  they  were  standing  in.  If  they 
resist,  the  mud  turns  to  stone,  but  they  are  not 
trapped. 

Smoking Magma (S-17) 

20.7 Special Knowledge Rituals

which  wells  up  from underground.  The  pool  has a 
radius of 5 feet (+1 / Rank). Any entity within the 
area covered by the pool suffers damage of [D - 5] 
(+  1  / Rank).  If  the  target  successfully  resists, this 
damage  is  halved.  Note  that  while  the  entity  is 
within  the  area  of  effect  the  damage  is  applied 
every pulse.

ber of javelins which appear is 1 (+ 1 / 2 (or frac-

Effects:  If  the  is  ritual  successful,  the  Adept  gains 
complete control over a 500 pound weight of earth 
and stone (plus an additional 500 pound weight per 
Rank).  They  can  shape  or  move  the  earth,  change 
its  consistency  or  instill  intelligence  in  it  as  they 
choose.  The  Base  Chance  to  successfully  employ 
this  ritual  is  10%.  It  can  affect  any  earth  or  stone

formed at the end of the duration, the affected earth 
becomes permanently bound (that is, it contains no 
life and blocks all earth shaping effects, for exam-
ple, Hands of Earth, Earth Elementals, Tunnelling).
