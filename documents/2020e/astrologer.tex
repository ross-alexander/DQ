\begin{Chapter}{Astrologer (Ver 1.0)}

The celestial bodies have a definite, if not entirely understood,
effect upon the lives of the inhabitants of a DragonQuest world. These
Great Powers seem to impose predestination upon all but the
strongwilled, and determine the aspect of each being. The Sun, the
Moon, and the Planets regularly cause perturbations in the flow of
mana; the mighty Stars affect a world across the vast reaches of space
by their positions relative to it.  The study of the purpose and
method of the Powers is the science of astrology.

An astrologer’s main talent is a limited ability to predict and shape
the future. An astrologer will be able to make clear, general
assertions, but will only be able to give obscure clues when asked for
specific details.

\section{Restrictions}

An astrologer must be able to read and write in one language at Rank 8
if they wish to advance beyond Rank 0.

\subsubsection{An astrologer may not make a general prediction or ask a specific
question concerning only themselves.}

One must consult another astrologer in these weighty matters.

\subsubsection{An astrologer may only try once to answer a particular question or to
forecast the outcome of an event.}

Once an astrologer has made a reading (i.e. a determination about the
future), they may not seek to change or influence the reading through
their art.  Other astrologers who attempt to read the same future will
receive the same information that the first astrologer did. A second
astrologer may, however, receive some clarification about the
first’s reading.

\subsubsection{The results of a reading will affect the pertinent course of events.}

The GM is expected to modify the outcome of an adventure or happening
in their world to conform with a determination made by an astrologer
or by an astrologer at the behest of a character.  The determination
does not preclude the characters’ actions from affecting the outcome
of the adventure or event: to the contrary, the GM must interpret the
reading as they see fit, and alter a few of the random dice-rolls
engendered by the characters’ actions accordingly.

A prophecy cannot be avoided by the affected character(s) changing
their plans.  The doom (which may be good) will follow them to the
undertaking they substitute for that which was pre- dicted.  However,
if a character asks a specific question predicated upon a given
action, the prophecy need not come to pass unless and until that
action is taken.

\section{Benefits}

\subsubsection{An astrologer’s Rank determines how many beings they can directly
affect with a single prediction.}

A being is directly affected by an astrologer’s art when the GM
modifies the result of an action taken by the being due to a prophecy.

An astrologer can directly affect up to (5 + 10 × Rank) beings with a
single prophecy. If an astrolo- ger attempts a prediction which would
directly affect more beings than their Rank allows, they receive no
answer.

\subsubsection{An astrologer may make (and possibly modify) a general prediction
during a reading.}

When an astrologer wishes to make a general prediction about a
particular venture or being, the player (or the GM) actually uses a
divinatory technique at their disposal.  Such a technique could be
reading the tarot, casting the I Ching, or any mutually agreed upon
method.

The result of the divination becomes the astrologer’s prediction.  If
the astrologer does not wish to make the prediction, they may
immediately attempt to change it.  The GM rolls percentile dice, and
if the roll is less than or equal to (5 × Willpower + 4 × Rank - 30),
the astrologer makes a second divination (which may not be changed).
If the roll is greater than the success percentage, the astrologer is
stuck with their first prediction.

\subsubsection{An astrologer may seek to answer up to Rank specific questions per
month.}

When a being poses a specific question to an astrologer willing to
attempt an answer, the GM rolls percentile dice. If the roll is equal
to or less than (6 × Rank + 4 × Perception), the astrologer is able to
give a correct answer. If the roll is greater than the success
percentage, they mutter meaningless gibberish.

All answers given to specific questions must be, at the very least,
obscure. The GM may respond with cryptic poetry, much like the Oracle
at Delphi, or may choose to have the astrologer supply a riddle
(though the Player of the astrologer does not know the answer
themselves).

\subsubsection{An astrologer can determine the aspect of a being after observing
them.}

After an astrologer has spent (60 - Rank) consecutive minutes
observing a being, the GM informs the astrologer of the being’s
aspect.

An astrologer expends Fatigue points when practicing their art.
