\begin{Chapter}{Ranger (Ver 2.1)}

Rangers are trained to survive, and perhaps thrive, 
in  wilderness.  They  can  feed  themselves,  shelter 
from  the  elements,  choose  the  best  way  to  travel 
and  identify  natural  dangers.  Rangers’  general 
training  is  useful  in any  outdoors  environment but 
they  benefit  further  from  learning  the  specifics  of 
particular environments. 

45.1 Benefits 

Primary Environment 

A  ranger  knows  far  more  about  the  environment 
with  which  they  are  most  familiar.  While  in  this 
primary environment the ranger’s base chances and 
formulas  should  be  calculated  as  if  they  were  2 
Ranks  higher.  A  ranger’s  initial  primary  environ-
ment is that in which they learnt the skill. A ranger 
may  later  choose  to  change  their  primary  environ-
ment during ranking. 

The ranger must train in the new environment, the 
ranking  time  is  increased  by  1  week  and  the  EP 
cost  for  this  rank  is  increased  by  50%  (to  maxi-
mum  of  +3000  EP).  To  return  to  a  previously 
learnt  primary  environment  the  ranger  must  spend 
500 EP and 2 weeks in the environment. After rank 
10 a ranger may learn a new environment by train-
ing for 4 weeks in the new environment and spend-
ing 3000 EP. 

Stealth Bonus 

While  using  any  of  the  abilities  in  this  skill  a 
ranger  gains  a  bonus  to  stealth  of  +  3  /  Rank.  No 
other skill bonuses to stealth may be applied at the 
same time as this bonus. 

Finding Food 

Foraging  A  ranger  knows  how  to  find  water,  edi-
ble plants, and animals suitable for the pot. Forag-
ing  includes  finding  plants,  setting  snares,  hunting 
small  animals,  fishing  etc.  Snares  should  be  left 
overnight (or even days) to be successful. A ranger 
does not need to make an attack roll but may auto-
matically  kill  small  animals  that  were  caught  dur-
ing foraging. 

In  an  average  area  in  one  hour  a  ranger  can  find 
enough  food  to  feed  one  person  for  a  day  (+  30 
minutes  per  extra  person).  The  volume  of  food 
available is dependent on fertility and season so the 
GM should adjust the time to suit the environment. 
If a ranger wants to hunt larger animals they should 
use  the  Tracking  ability  to  locate  game  and  then 
use  an  appropriate  hunting  weapon  to  kill  it  (i.e. 
ranged  weapons,  spear).  If  they  make  a  successful 
attack  then  their  quarry  is  immediately  killed.  If 
they  miss the  animal  will  flee.  If  a  ranger  is  hunt-
ing predators, extremely large animals or sentients 
they must use the combat rules to kill their quarry. 
A  ranger  and  mechanician  may  combine  their 
abilities  to  build  and  conceal  large  traps,  pit  falls, 
etc at the GM’s discretion. 

Identify  and  Find  Plants  and  Animals  A  ranger 
can  recognise  common  plants  and  animals.  They 
have  a  (Perception  +  10  /  Rank)%  chance  of  re-
solving  whether  a  strange  plant  or  animal  is  suit-
able  for  food.  If  they  roll  10%  or  less  than  their 
success chance  they  may  also  notice  other  proper-
ties of the item (e.g. poisonous, valuable etc). 

A ranger can identify the types of entities living in 
an  area  from  the  traces  they  leave  behind  (tracks, 
game  paths,  grazing  signs, prey  remains  etc).  This 
takes  about  15  minutes  and  gives  them  an  idea  of 
the variety of animals in the area (e.g. the primary 
carnivore is a wolf pack; there is a large herd of red 
deer and a flock of pigeons). 

A ranger may search for a specific plant or animal 
(including  herbs  required  in  the  First  Aid  ability), 
provided it is native to the region. The base chance 
is  2  ×  PC  +  5  /  Rank  (-  0  if  common,  -  25  if  un-
common and - 75 if rare). This roll should be made 
once per hour of searching. 

Tracking  A  ranger  can  follow  the  tracks  left  by 
entities  moving  on  the  ground.  In  calm  weather, 
tracks normally last around 10 days but the clarity 
and  duration  of  tracks  will  be  enhanced  by  the 
number of entities, or soft ground, and reduced by 
hard  ground,  rough  weather,  or  if  the  entity  is 
trying  to  hide  their  tracks.  The  base  chance  of 
following  tracks  is  Perception  (+  5  /  Rank)  (+2  / 
entity in group) (4 / Rank of quarry’s ability to hide 
tracks).  If  a  ranger  is  following  a  fresh  track  they 
will  be  aware  when  they  are  close  enough  to  be 
detected. They may then use stealth to sneak up on 
their quarry and they will be able to get 25% closer 
than  a  non-ranger  before  there  is  a  possibility  of 
being detected. 

Camping 

Preparing Food A ranger knows how to get a fire 
going, gut and skin animals, and cook simple meals 
over an open fire. 

Campsites  A  ranger  knows  where  to  set  up  camp 
so  that  they  are  sheltered  from  the  elements,  close 
to water, or other by criteria they may choose (e.g. 
hidden or defensible). 

A  ranger  can  easily  erect  tents, they  can  add  extra 
comfort to a campsite by setting up tarps to protect 
from wind or water, and they can take advantage of 
nearby resources to build a crude shelter. 

Travelling 

Orientation  A  ranger  has  a  sensitivity  towards 
north. They are able to pinpoint true north to within 
(10  -  Rank)  degrees  and  from  this  they  can  work 
out the other compass directions. 

Map  Reading  A  ranger  can  read  a  simple  map  if 
they  can  relate  their  physical  surroundings  to  the 
symbols  on  that  map.  There  are  no  standard  sym-
bols  or  keys  so  interpreting  a  new  map  is  a  chal-
lenge  of  the  Ranger’s  wits  and  experience.  A 
ranger may place themselves on a map if they can 
determine the direction of two marked landmarks. 

Route  Finding  A  ranger  is  rarely  lost  and  can 
normally  back  track  to  a  known  point.  They  learn 
to  recognise  landmarks  from  unfamiliar  directions 
and  estimate  the  time  and  effort  required  to  travel 
through  various  terrain.  A  ranger  can  pick  a  route 
through  unknown  terrain  based  on  ease  of  travel, 
speed, stealth, or safety etc. The base chance of the 
ranger picking the best route for their purpose is 2 
×  Perception  (+5  /  rank)%.  The  roll  should  be 
made  by  the  GM  and  if  the  ranger  fails  then  the 
route travelled should be hard or longer or danger-
ous  as  appropriate.  This  roll  should  only  be  made 
once per day. 

After a ranger has travelled through an area several 
times they do not need to use known routes but can 
freely take shortcuts or choose better routes. 

Distance Estimates A ranger can estimate distance 
travelled  overland  to  within  (90  +  Rank)%  accu-
racy. 

Safety 

Detect  Hidden  In  a  natural  setting  a  ranger  may 
notice  hidden  entities,  or  recognise  an  ambush  or 
trap before they  walk into it. The base chance is 3 
× Perception (+ 5 / Rank) (-5 / Rank of person who 
did the hiding or set the ambush or trap). 

Hide Tracks A ranger can obscure the tracks of 1 
(+ 1 / Rank) entities moving in the same direction. 
It takes 30 (1 / Rank) minutes to obscure 100 yards 
of track. This time may be reduced if the ground is 
rocky or naturally hard. 

Hide Entities A ranger can attempt to hide 1 (+ 1 / 
Rank) entities in natural cover. The  ease of hiding 
someone is dependent on the available terrain. The 
GM  should  advise  a  modifier  based  on  the  terrain 
of 1 (e.g. flat open ground) to 10 (e.g. thick bushes 
or jungle). The base chance of hiding is (modifier × 
Rank) - 5. (NB this ability does not imply that the 
ranger can set up ambushes). 

126 

First  Aid  A  ranger  knows  simple  first  aid  to  pre-
vent  minor  accidents  in  the  wilderness  becoming 
severe. They know how to:  

• Stop external bleeding  

• Splint broken bones  

• Treat minor burns  

• Recognise the effects of common natural poisons 

They  also  know  how  to  brew  tisanes  (herbal  teas) 
which help reduce the effects of headaches, nausea, 
fevers  and  food  poisoning.  To  make  tisanes  the 
ranger  requires  fresh  common  herbs  (which  have 
been picked within 24 hours of use). 

The First Aid abilities cannot be used in combat. 

45.2 Environments 
The  environments  a  ranger  may  choose  as  their 
primary environment are dominated by similarities 
of climate, terrain and fertility. These environments 
cover  lightly  populated  areas  eg.  open  farmland, 
moors,  but do  not  include  towns,  cities,  etc.  Some 
environments overlap. 

Arctic Includes tundra, steppes, permafrost and ice 
caps  and  other  infertile  lowlands  in  cold  climates. 
Fertility:  Infertile,  Seasons:  standard,  note  that 
winter  has  no  daylight  &  summer  has  no  night 
time. 

Caverns  Includes  all  caves,  tunnels,  natural  cav-
erns,  and  other  substantial  underground  areas. 
Fertility: Infertile, Seasons: always low season. 

Coastal Includes land adjacent to saltwater, estuar-
ies, coastal marshes etc. Fertility: Average or poor, 
Seasons: standard. 

Highlands  Includes  hills  and  mountains,  moors, 
high  plateaus.  Also  includes  evergreen  forests  on 
steep ground. These areas are fertile in summer but 
snow or ice covered and hostile in winter. Fertility: 
Poor, Seasons: standard. 

Jungle  Includes  hot  climate  forests  of  any  sort. 
They  are  particularly  characterised  by  heavy  un-
dergrowth  and  high  rainfall.  Fertility:  Rich,  Sea-
sons: wet/dry. 

Plains  Includes  grasslands,  plains, pampas,  savan-
nah, prairie, veldt, and other more or less open and 
flat or rolling terrain. May include low hills where 
the  land  is  open  and  not  wooded.  Fertility:  Poor, 
Seasons: standard. 

Rural  Generally  mild  climate  cultivated  terrain, 
lightly inhabited. Includes cultivated fields, grazing 
lands,  vineyards,  heaths,  etc.  Fertility:  Average, 
Seasons: standard. 

Waste  Includes  all  deserts,  wastelands,  salt  flats, 
and other infertile lowlands in mild to hot climates. 
Fertility:  Infertile,  Seasons:  Reversed  in  hot  re-
gions  as  the  most  fertile  period  is  autumn  and  the 
least fertile summer. 

(freshwater) 

Includes  marshes  & 
Wetlands 
swamps,  and  land  adjacent  to  freshwater  rivers, 
lakes  &  ponds,  etc.  Fertility:  Rich,  Seasons:  stan-
dard. 

Woods  Includes mild climate deciduous and ever-
green  forests  or  large  wooded  areas  with  few  sen-
tient inhabitants, in mild to cold climates. Fertility: 
Average, Seasons: standard.
