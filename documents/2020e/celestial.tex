\begin{College}[1.3]{celestial}{Celestial Magics}{CE}

The College of Celestial Magics is concerned with the practice of
those magic arts having to do with the elements of light and dark and
their contrasts.  There are four distinct divisions of the College of
Celestial Magics, each of which is concerned with a different
combination of light and dark.

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={XX}}
Solar Mages	& Light \\
Star Mages	& Light within Dark \\
Shadow Weaving	& Dark within Light \\
Dark Mages	& Dark  \\
\end{dqtblr}

Solar \& Star Mages use the element of Light; Shadow Weavers and Dark
Mages use the element of Darkness.

All members of the college must be associated with only one division
of this College, and may only change divisions by forsaking their
present division, and relearning the new division as if it were a
different college.

Most entities are aligned with either Light or Dark, and Celestial
Magics will often only affect entities of the opposed aspect.
Entities’ fear of their opposing element gives this College special
power.  Whether an entity is Light aspected, Dark aspected, or has
neither aspect, is determined per the rules given in Light and Dark
Aspect (§19.8).

\subsection{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Celestial Magics may not practise their arts
in an area where their element is not present.

A Magical Aptitude of 14 is required to learn this College. Note also
that certain spells of this college may only be learnt by specific
divisions (as listed after the Spell Number).

\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}

The Base Chance of performing any talent, spell, or ritual of the
College of Celestial Magics is modified by the following numbers,
based on the division to which the adept belongs.

\subsubsection{Aspect Modifiers}

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={Xr}}
Solar Mage with a Solar Aspect	& +1\% \\
Solar Mage with a Lunar Aspect	& -1\% \\
Dark Mage with a Solar Aspect	& -1\% \\
Dark Mage with a Lunar Aspect	& +1\% \\
\end{dqtblr}

\subsubsection{Lighting Condition Modifiers}

An Adept of Celestial Magics is affected greatly by the lighting
conditions in their vicinity.  The bonuses and penalties gained in
this section apply only to non-magical forms of Light and Dark.
Magical forms of the elements may at best neutralise any penalties
suffered due to the natural elements.  For the purposes of these
modifiers, the vicinity is deemed to be any bounded area around the
Adept (such as a room) or, if the Adept is in the open, the area
within 30’ of the Adept.

Shadow Weavers must be within a shadow that has a defined edge within
the vicinity (the shadow must be large enough to contain the Adept,
and cannot be generated from the Adept’s possessions), and Star Mages
must be in direct light from point sources (eg. casting a shadow),
otherwise the lighting condition modifier is -25\\%.

The lighting modifiers are in the Celestial Lighting Modifiers table
(§19.9).


\section{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Speak to Creatures of Light/Darkness}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{50}
\resist{None}
\begin{effects}
This talent allows the adept to communicate in a limited fashion with
non-sentient creatures.  A Solar Mage or Star mage may communicate
with those creatures who are light aspected, whereas a Shadow Weaver
or Dark Mage may communicate with those creatures who are dark
aspected.  The talent is limited to a range of 10’ (+ 10’ / Rank), and
the communication is equivalent to a language skill of 1 (+ 1 for
every 5 full Ranks).  The communication is a combination of spoken and
sign language.  If either vision or sound is not possible then the
talent operates at half its actual Rank (round down).  Moreover, if
neither of these senses are available then the talent cannot function
at all.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Night Vision}

\range{50 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Always active}
\multiple{100}
\begin{effects}
This talent allows the adept to see in the dark with vision similar to
that of a cat. Everything will appear monochromatic (i.e.  shades of
grey) and it is difficult to accurately estimate distance.  The higher
the Rank, the less of a problem this will be. Because the vision is
monochromatic it cannot be used to do a Detect Aura.  Note that some
amount of light must be present before any sort of vision is possible.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-3]{Detect Aura}

\range{Special}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{Perception + 5\% / Rank}
\resist{Active}
\begin{effects}
 The effects of this talent are described in §9.1.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}


\section{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Blending}

\range{15 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{50}
\basechance{60\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Once this spell is cast, the target must remain still in order for it
to have effect.  While remaining still the target is not able to be
seen by non-magical means (i.e.  as for invisibility).  If the target
moves, the spell ceases to work. However, if the target becomes still
again during the duration of the spell, it will resume its effect.
The duration of the spell refers to the time since casting, not the
time that the spell is actually in effect (i.e.  while the target is
still).

Keeping still will require (as a minimum) a 4 × WP check every hour.
The target may be required to make additional willpower checks at the
GM’s discretion.

The spell only has effect while the target is “still”.  This means
that the target is unable to move any of its external surfaces, with
limited exceptions. Moving an external surface encompasses such
actions as moving a limb, or opening and closing the mouth.  Blinking
and normal bodily movement caused by normal breathing will not
constitute moving for the purposes of this spell.  The following
actions will automatically cause the spell to cease working: talking,
spell casting, triggering (subject to any revision of the Investment
ritual) readying a weapon, altering facing in a hex, moving from the
hex, using a silent language, or indeed any Action other than a Pass
action (and Pass actions being restricted as outlined).  Note that it
is not relevant if an observer would see the movement for the spell to
cease working (e.g.  moving hands behind back, or talking behind hand
will both cause the spell to cease having an effect).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Light}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{15 minutes × [D - 5] × [Rank]}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a volume in which non-magical darkness is partially
suppressed.  The volume will be 1000 (+ 500 / Rank) cubic feet, and
may be in any one contiguous area the Adept desires, provided that no
dimension is smaller than one foot.  The entire volume must be visible
and within range at time of casting, and may not be moved.  For
visibility purposes, the Spell will in-crease Lighting levels within
the volume to 60\% + 2\% / Rank.  Rank 20 Light may not be seen
through.  It will not aid in providing bonuses for casting purposes,
though it will neutralise penalties due to natural darkness, to a
maximum of 5\% + 1\% / Rank.  The volume counts as direct light for
Star \& Shadow Mages.  If the lighting conditions are higher than that
provided by the spell, no effect will be apparent.  Note that because
darkness is being suppressed, no light is generated, so any area
outside the volume will not be lit.  This spell can engender
silhouettes, though not create shadows. If it is not possible to see
into a lit volume, then objects within the volume are not visible.
Any of this volume may be overridden by a higher ranked Spell of
Darkness, or neutralised (back to original conditions) by an equal
rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Darkness}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{15 minutes × [D - 5] × [Rank]}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a volume in which non-magical light is partially
suppressed.  The volume will be 1000 (+ 500 / Rank) cubic feet, and
may be in any one contiguous area the Adept desires, provided that no
dimension is smaller than one foot.  The entire volume must be visible
and within range at time of casting, and may not be moved.  For
visibility purposes, the Spell will increase Darkness levels within
the volume to 60\% + 2\% / Rank.  Rank 20 Darkness may not be seen
through. It will not aid in providing bonuses for casting purposes,
though it will neutralise penalties due to natural light, to a maximum
of 5\% + 1\% / Rank.  The volume counts as direct shadow for Star \&
Shadow Mages.  If the lighting conditions are lower than that provided
by the spell, no effect will be apparent.  Note that because light is
only being suppressed, it may still pass through, and no shadows are
generated outside the volume. If it is possible to see through a
Darkness, everything beyond it is normally visible.  This spell can
engender silhouettes of lit objects against the darkness, though not
create shadows.  Any of this volume may be overridden by a higher
ranked Spell of Light, or neutralised (back to original conditions) by
an equal rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Shadow Form / Coruscade}

\range{15 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell is enveloped in a confusing pattern of either
shadows (for Dark and Shadow) or coruscating light (for Solar and
Star), which increases their defence versus physical Melee or Ranged
attacks by 2 (+ 2 / Rank).  In Close combat only 1 (+ 1 / Rank) is
gained.  No form of magical vision will aid in avoiding the defence
bonus produced as a result of this spell, but any attack made without
using the sense of sight (e.g. by a blind entity, a trample attack)
will not be affected. It is usually quite apparent when an entity is
under the effect of this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\begin{spell}[G-5]{Wall of Starlight}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
Creates a 10’ high, 1’ thick, 20’ long wall of light, or a 10’ high,
l’ thick, 5’ internal radius ring of light, or a 15’ high, 5’ diameter
pillar of light.

The adept may increase any dimension by 1’ / Rank. The wall cannot be
cast so as to include any entity within it, other than the Adept.  Any
entity who is dark aspected must passively resist or suffer [D - 5] (
+ 1 / Rank) damage each time they come within contact with the wall
(not per pulse).  Any entity damaged by the wall must roll on the
fright table.  The wall created banishes darkness from within its
bounds in the same manner as a Spell of Light of the same Rank.  The
entirety of one edge must be affixed to a surface. This means that a
wall can be created with a smaller dimension than would otherwise be
possible. For example, casting a wall of light on a stepping stone
that is 3’ square will result in a wall which is only 3’ long.  Any
edge may be affixed but, for the purposes of this spell, this does not
include either face.  For example, a wall could not be placed flat
on a large open surface.  The surface or surfaces that the Wall of
Light is affixed to do not need to be flat, but the length of the wall
is measured from the deepest depression on the surface that the wall
fills.  For example, a circularly concave wall of 5’ radius, with a
rank 0 wall affixed to it will end in a flit edge 15’ beyond the end
of the curvature.  The entire anchoring edge must be visible to the
Adept.  The wall itself cannot be moved.  Should an entire
cross-section of the last remaining anchoring edge be removed then the
wall will immediately dissipate.

\begin{example} 
An Adept casts a wall 1’ off the ground, attached to a door. As soon
as the door is opened the wall is dissipated.  If, however, the adept
had cast it so that it overlapped the door frame, and it projected
slightly above the top of the door, then it would not have been
dissipated because no entire cross-section of the anchoring edge has
been removed. In this case somebody with a sharp implement (and quite
a bit of patience) could scratch away at the stone wall until they had
created a groove through the entire cross-section of the Wall of
Starlight in order to make it dissipate.
\end{example}

Note that this spell will not be affected by a Spell of Darkness
except to reduce its lighting effect.

Solar and Star mages get a reduction to the Experience Multiple of 50
(to 100) and +5\% to base chance.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Wall of Darkness}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell works similarly to the Wall of Starlight Spell, except that
light aspected creatures are affected by it, and it banishes light in
the same manner as a Spell of Darkness of the same Rank.

Shadow and Dark mages get a reduction to the Experience Multiple of 50
(to 100) and +5\% to base chance.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Witchsight}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may see objects or entities which are invisible and they
appear to have a slight blue sheen around them.  If the invisibility
effect (excluding Walking Unseen) is of a higher Rank than the
Witchsight, the object or entity may not be clearly identified or
directly magically targeted.  The Adept may also see in the dark as a
Human does on a cloudy day, with an effective range of vision of 150
feet under the open sky, and 75 feet elsewhere.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Walking Unseen}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not invisible.  This
means that it will not transmit light. As a consequence the target
will cast a shadow (which may or may not be noticed depending on the
lighting etc — even if noticed may not be connected to the target) and
have a reflection in a mirror (or any reflective surface).  However
the target may not be noticed even if another entity is looking
directly at him/her.  It should be noted that a crystal of vision or
similar would count as looking directly at the target, not as a
reflection.  An entity will get a perception check if the target
becomes invasive on that entity’s senses (e.g. standing in a frontal
adjacent hex, or standing behind the entity with the target’s hands
over his/her eyes). Although the target is not invisible, it may be
detected using any magical means for detecting invisible entities
(e.g. witchsight).

If the target of the spell, or the target’s possessions, are touched
by another entity, or that entity’s possessions, then the spell is
broken. The target of the spell may not break it voluntarily (other
than by, for example, touching another entity). Once broken the spell
must be recast.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9 Solar]{Resistance to Light}

\range{Self}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
While under the effects of this spell, an adept gains 2\% (+ 2 / Rank)
to the chance of resisting magical, light-based attacks.  This
includes Flash of Light, Wall of Starlight, Bolt of Starfire, Web of
Light, Solar Flare and Whitefire. The target will also become fully
protected from damage caused by non-magical light (e.g.  sunburn,
snowblindness), with the exception that it will not protect Greater
Undead from sunlight.  In addition, it allows vision in a Rank 20
Light Spell. Only Solar Mages may learn this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9 Star]{Illumination}

\range{15 feet}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Object or area}
\begin{effects}
This spell causes a 1 inch circle on any non-living surface to radiate
light. The intensity of light is determined by Rank: at Ranks 0–5 it
is merely a glow; at Ranks 6–10 it is equivalent to the light of a
candle; at Ranks 11–15 it is equivalent to the light of a torch; and
at 16–20 it is equivalent to that of a lantern.  Only Star Mages may
learn this spell.  It will not aid in providing bonuses for casting
purposes.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9 Shadow]{Charismatic Aura}

\range{Self}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
This spell allows the adept to use shadows advantageously to influence
reaction rolls.  The adept can choose one of three different effects
at the time of casting.  These are: to appear imposing or threatening,
to appear alluring or seductive, or to appear helpless and in need of
protection.  When used in appropriate circumstances these effects
modify reaction rolls by 5\% (+ 1 / Rank).  For example, when dealing
with an Orc Chief the first of the effects would probably be most
beneficial. It is very difficult to perceive that the spell is in
effect.  Only Shadow Weavers may learn this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\begin{spell}[G-9 Dark]{Strength of Darkness}

\range{15 feet}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target’s Physical Strength is increased by 1 (+ 1 for every 2 (or
fraction) Ranks) for the duration of the spell.  This spell may only
be cast by Dark Mages when they are in an area of at least 60\%
Darkness.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\section{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Reading the Night Sky}

\multiple{150}
\basechance{MA + 4\% / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may read something of the future by performing this ritual.
The ritual may only be performed from a vantage point with a clear
view of the sky (not indoors or in a hollow), and it must be a clear
night.  The GM rolls for success or failure.  The GM provides the
answers writ in the stars in the form of generalised statements.  If a
successful roll occurs the statements should be generally accurate.
If a failure occurs then nothing is read.  If a backfire occurs then
the statements should be misleading.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}


\begin{ritual}[Q-2]{Summoning and Binding Creatures of Light / Darkness}

\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\% + 4\% / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\begin{effects}
The adept may summon and bind 1 (+1 for every 5 or fraction Ranks)
non-sentient creature whose aspect is the same as the aspect of the
division of the college to which the Adept belongs.  Any creature
summoned must be native to the area.  If the ritual succeeds, the
creature will arrive bound to the Adept.  In this state the creature
will try to protect and aid the adept to the utmost of its ability
(but it does not automatically know what the adept wishes it to do).
If the ritual backfires then the creature will arrive and immediately
attack the adept.  The creature will arrive after (20 - D10 - Rank)
minutes (minimum of 0).  Bound creatures will continue to serve the
Adept as long as passive concentration is maintained (the Adept stays
conscious and does not attempt any other spell that requires
concentration).  If the Adept is stunned, a 3 × Willpower ( + 2 /
Rank) Willpower check is required to maintain concentration.  If the
concentration is broken the creature will immediately attack the
Adept.  The Adept may at any time release any of the creatures, in
which case the creature concerned will immediately flee from the
Adept’s presence.

Creatures that may be summoned using this ritual are those
appropriately aspected, non-sentient beings from the following
categories: 66.2 Felines, 66.4 Small Land Mammals, 67.1 Common Avians,
69.1 Lizards and Kindred (except Hydras), 69.2 Snakes, 69.3 Insects
and Spiders, and 72 Creatures of Night and Shadow.  Note: Weres can
only be affected by this ritual while they are in their beast form.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}


\section{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Healing}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Cures 1 point of Endurance or Fatigue ( + 1 / every 2 or fraction
Ranks).  This spell will not cure specific Grievous Injuries and the
extra endurance points associated with any Grievous Injury, nor will
it “cure” tiredness fatigue (including that lost due to spell
casting).  However, this spell can cure as if the curing was attempted
by a healer of Rank equivalent to the Rank of the spell / 5 (round
down).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Creating Light/Dark Sword}
\range{15 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cause any sword (as listed on the weapons chart) within
range to become a sword of the Adept’s element (i.e. light for Solar
or Star Mages, and Dark for Shadow Weavers or Dark Mages).  The sword
will then have its Strike Chance increased by 1\% (+ 1 / Rank) and its
Damage increased by 1 (+ 1 / every 3 or fraction Ranks) whenever it is
used against a creature of the opposite element (i.e. dark aspected
for a Light Sword and light aspected for a Dark Sword).  Light Swords
sparkle with small white sparks, and dark swords appear blacker than
black.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Bolt of Starfire}

\range{40 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity, object or volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept casts a bolt of starfire towards any target within range.
The target may be a volume of air.  The first entity or object that
the bolt hits along its flight path suffers [D - 4] (+ 1 / Rank)
damage unless the target successfully resists.  If fired at figures in
Close Combat the bolt will hit a random target (based on their
relative sizes).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Meteorite Shower}

\range{60 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Delayed effect}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The adept calls down from the heavens a meteorite shower which peppers
a given area that was entirely within the Adept’s range at the time of
casting.  The meteorite shower is targeted to hit a specific hex and
takes 2 minutes (-10 seconds / Rank) to arrive (minimum of the end of
the following pulse).  Any entities within a vertical column that is
25 feet in diameter (centred on the target hex), with a height equal
to the spell’s range) must resist or suffer [D - 4] (+1 / Rank)
damage.  The Adept may counterspell this spell at any time prior to
the meteorite shower arriving by casting the appropriate counterspell
at the targeted hex.  The targeted hex will have a magical aura until
the meteorite shower arrives (or is counterspelled by the Adept).
This spell will have no effect if it is targeted on a hex which is
already a target of this spell.  Note that a solid surface (such as
10’ of earth) will prevent the meteorite shower from reaching its
target hex.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Star / Shadow Wings}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Sentient Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell receives wings comprising of the element of
the Adept (i.e.  Light if a Solar or Star Mage, and Dark if a Shadow
Weaver or Dark Mage). These wings will carry the target, and anything
that the target can carry, at a speed of 30 (+1 / Rank) miles per
hour.  (NB : 1 mph approximately 1.5’ / sec = 1.5 hexes / pulse.
During a takeoff or landing half that distance will be travelled).
The wings have a wingspan of 30’ and are insubstantial. If the wings
come in contact with an object they will cease to work until they can
once more spread unhindered (e.g. 30’ of open ground is usually
necessary in order to start using them).  Note that normal
precipitation (i.e.  rain, mist, snow and hail) will not cause the
wings to cease functioning.  The Wings will not become invisible or
unseen if the wearer does.  Star Wings are clearly visible at night
and barely visible during the day, and Shadow Wings are clearly
visible during the day and barely visible at night.  During the last 5
seconds of the duration of the wings they will automatically try to
land.  There is no earlier warning of the end of duration of the
wings. Only sentient creatures can control the wings.

Since shadow wings are made of shadow they are clearly insubstantial
and hence can be worn in confined spaces.  However, for them to be
able to be used, they require to be properly and fully extended, that
is shaped, and will fly at full speed or not at all. It requires 1
pulse to start and 1 pulse to stop.  They will only fly a humanoid
character and characters of human size.  That is taken to mean
characters of 3 hexes or less.  They will carry a character plus the
character’s normal encumbrance.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Web of Light / Darkness}

\range{30 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{ Concentration  (Maximum  of  15  minute + 15 / Rank)}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
A five foot wide web of the element of the Adept is projected from the
finger tips to a target hex, object or entity.  Any entities not
aspected to the element of the web, and all objects, are ensnared by
the web.  The web may only ensnare a number of entities equal to the
Adepts rank, so it will stop at the hex at which this limit is reached
(or at maximum range).  Entities ensnared in the web suffer [D - 2]
(+1 / Rank) damage (halved if they successfully resist) each pulse
that they remain in the web after the first. The damage is done at the
end of each pulse. Any ensnared entity must roll 1 × Physical Strength
(2 × if they successfully resisted) in order to move themselves to an
adjacent hex (which may be free of the web), or to perform an action
within the web. A similar check is required for any entity (regardless
of aspect) attempting to remove an object from the web. If an entity
receives aid in removing themselves from the web, the PS of the aiding
character may be combined with their own.  Five or more points damage
from a single blow from a B-class weapon will destroy the entire web.
Treat the web’s defence as being equal to its Rank.  Entities of the
same aspect as the element of the web may ignore its effects, but
consequently may not affect the web.  They may aid other character in
getting free of the web.  Any dropped object will become ensnared by
the web, as will any entity not aspected to the element of the web who
comes into contact with it (up to the limit of the web).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Fear}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{15 seconds + 15 / Rank}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell is seized by uncontrollable fear and must
roll on the Fright table.  At the time of casting, the Adept may
choose to modify the Fright Table roll up or down by an amount up to
the rank of the spell.  On a double or triple effect this modification
may be doubled or tripled respectively.

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Increased Gravity}

\range{60 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: maximum 1 minute + 1 /}
Rank 
\multiple{450}
\basechance{2\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell causes a target of the Adept’s choice which is within range
to suffer the effects of an increase in gravity unless they
successfully resist.  This increase in gravity subtracts 2 (+2 / Rank)
from the target’s strength and 1 for every 2 Ranks (or fraction) from
the target’s TMR.  The target must roll under 3 × strength each pulse
or become immediately prone. Once prone, a roll of 1 × modified
strength is required in order to stand up.  If the target’s strength
is reduced to less than zero, the target suffers the negative amount
as damage each pulse and must roll under Willpower + current Endurance
in order to remain conscious.  If the target and Adept become
separated by a distance greater than the range of the spell then the
spell immediately ceases to work.  If the target is under (or comes
under) the effect of a flying spell, the following applies:

• If the rank of the flying spell is greater than the rank of the
Increased Gravity then the target may be able to fly.  However, twice
the rank of the Increased Gravity is subtracted from the rank of the
flying spell for purposes of determining speed and lift of the flying
spell. This may make it a negative modifier which may reduce the speed
to 0 or less, in which case the target may not fly but may stand.

• If the rank of the flying spell is less than or equal to the rank of
the Increasing Gravity, then the target may not fly.  However, half
the rank of the flying spell is subtracted from the rank of the
Increased Gravity for purposes of determining the strength and TMR
reductions.

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Whitefire}

\range{30 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell must resist or be instantaneously subjected
to the heat of the interior of a star, causing death.  The target’s
body is a blackened husk, their skin needs to be regenerated and their
chance of resurrection is reduced by 2\% / Rank.  If the target’s
Willpower is greater than or equal to the cast chance then the target
will not be affected. Protection from magical fire will not help
against this spell.
\end{effects}

\begin{spell}[S-10 solar]{Solar Flare}

\range{75 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Delayed effect}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept calls down an incandescent lance of sunlight which blasts an
area of 1 hex (+ 2 hexes / 4 full ranks) in diameter.  All
non-sentient flora is immediately withered and charred.  Any entities
within the area must resist or suffer [D + 10] damage (+ 1 / 2 or
fraction ranks).  The flare takes 60 seconds (-5 / Rank) to arrive
(minimum of 5 seconds). The flare will always arrive at the end of a
pulse and during that pulse the area will be brightly illuminated
(that is 99\% Light). This spell may only be cast when the sun is in
the sky. Only Solar Mages may learn this spell.
\end{effects}

\begin{spell}[S-10 Star]{Falling Star}

\range{75 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Delayed effect}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept calls from the sky a meteor which crashes into a given area
that was within the Adept’s range at the time of casting. The meteor
is targeted to hit a specific hex and takes 5 minutes (20 seconds /
Rank) to arrive (minimum of 5 seconds). The meteor will always arrive
at the end of the pulse and will be preceded during that pulse by a
high-pitched whistle in the general area.  Any entities within the
target hex suffer [D + 12] (+ 4 / Rank) damage.  Entities within
adjacent hexes suffer [D + 2] (+ 1 / Rank) damage.  If an entity
successfully resists it suffers only half damage (round up).  The
Adept may counterspell this spell at any time prior to the meteor
arriving by casting the appropriate counterspell at the targeted hex.
The targeted hex will have a magical aura until the meteor arrives (or
is counterspelled by the Adept).  This spell will have no effect if it
is targeted on a hex which is already a target of this spell.  Only
Star Mages may cast this spell.

\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
From the Adept’s fingertips erupts a column of black flames which
travel to the extent of the spell’s range, and is 5 feet wide.  The
Adept may increase the width by one foot per rank.  All entities
occupying hexes through which the fire passes must resist or suffer [D
  - 2] ( + 1 per Rank) damage.  Entities who are damaged by this spell
have their base chance of infection increased by 20 (+ 2 / Rank). Any
entities wholly within the area of the fire must also roll under 1 ×
Willpower (2 × Willpower if they successfully resisted) or suffer the
effects of a roll on the fright table.  Protection from magical fires
will not help against this spell.  Only Dark Mages may learn this
spell.

\begin{effects}
The Adept may instantly teleport from within one shadow to another
shadow. The destination must be within sight or must have been
carefully memorised beforehand.  The destination may be up to 5 miles
(+ 1 / Rank) distant. Only Shadow Weavers may cast this spell.

\section{Special Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[R-1]{Conjuring and Controlling Light / Dark Sphere}

\duration{Concentration: Maximum 5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{1\% + 3\% / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon a 12” (+ 1” / Rank) diameter sphere comprised of
the element of their division of the college. Solar and Star Mages
summon a Light Sphere which is as bright as the sun and coruscates
with sparks of light.  Dark Mages and Shadow Weavers create a Dark
Sphere which is inky black and seems to suck light into it.  If the
ritual is successful the sphere will appear within 15’ of the Adept
under the Adept’s control.  Active concentration is required to move
the sphere, which may move at up to 6 (+ 1 / 4 full Ranks) TMR. Once
the Adept stops concentrating, or the duration of 5 minutes (+ 5 /
Rank) is reached, the sphere will return to its own dimension.  If the
Adept fails to summon the sphere, nothing happens.  If a backfire
results (the Cast Check is more than 30 above the Cast Chance), the
sphere appears, but is not under control so will move randomly about
at maximum TMR.  Anything that comes into contact with a Dark Sphere
must resist or be immediately sucked into oblivion.  Anything that
comes into contact with a Light Sphere must resist or be immediately
reduced to a pile of ashes.  An entity that resists simply suffers D10
damage and is thrown to the ground by the shock of contact.  It is
believed that if a Light Sphere comes in contact with a Dark Sphere a
cataclysmic explosion results (however there are no known witnesses to
such an event).

\end{ritual}


\section{Light and Dark Aspect}

Most creatures are either Light or Dark aspected, depending on whether
they are nocturnal or diurnal (active during the day). There is no
direct connection between the possession of a Light or Dark aspect and
the self-styled “Powers of Light and Darkness”.  Entities of Light
aspect are not necessarily “good” nor entities of Dark aspect “evil”.
The aspect refers only to the Entity’s position with regard to the
Elements of Light and Dark. It is also differs from an entity’s
astrological Aspect (see §1.4), but may be influenced by it.

To determine if an Entity is aspected with either of the elements of
Light or Dark, follow these rules:

• If the entity is a Celestial Mage then this determines their
aspect: Solar and Star Mages are Light aspected; Shadow and Dark Mages
are Dark aspected.

• If the entity is not a Celestial Mage, and is Lunar aspected, then
they are Dark aspected.  Note that Shapechangers are Lunar aspected.

• If the entity is not a Celestial Mage, and is Solar aspected, they
are Light aspected.

• If none of the above applies, then an entity’s race or type may mean
that they are aspected with either Light or Dark.  Races or creatures
that are nocturnal, crepuscular (active at twilight) or live
predominantly underground are Dark aspected (Alusian examples:
Dwarves, Orcs, most cats, bats, wolves).  Races and creatures that are
diurnal, and who do not live underground are Light aspected.  Golems,
Elementals, and Beings of Mana or Spirit (or their manifestations) are
neither Light nor Dark aspected.
