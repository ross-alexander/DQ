\begin{College}[1.3]{water}{Water Magics}{WA}

The College of Water Magics is concerned with the shaping of the
element of water.  Water Mages, as Adepts of this college are known,
have difficulty in practising their magics on land without an abundant
source of their raw material and thus the col- lege has fallen
somewhat into disuse in many locales.  The typical vision people have
of Water Mages is of an Adept standing on the sea or guiding a ship
around reefs to a safe harbour. While it is true that some Water Mages
do perform such duties on ships, the majority either live beside large
bodies of water or in more recent times have taken to living entirely
underwater, thus spending all of their time in a different world from
that experienced by normal people.  In general, Water Mages enjoy good
relations with other colleges with the notable exceptions of the
elemental College of Fire, due to its opposing elemental nature.

\subsection{Traditional Colours}

The traditional colours worn by Water Mages have tended towards the
greens and blues that symbolise the sea.  Aquamarine and sea blue are
particularly popular amongst those who wish to advertise their
college.  The hermitic type of Water Mage who spends the majority of
their time underwater usually wear very little, a small bathing suit
at the most, as most denizens of the deep are not concerned about
nudity.

\subsection{Traditional Symbols}

Water Mage adornments are usually unique items found only upon the sea
floor such as rare shells or pieces of coral, also wave, fish and
whale motifs are popular or any animal or occurrence specific to the
sea they live in.

\section{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Water Magics may only practice their arts if
they are in contact with, or near, water.  With the exception of
Dowsing, they may never practice their arts in a vacuum or in a
totally arid place.  They may not summon water-dwelling creatures into
an area that does not contain a body of water large enough for the
water- dwelling creature to immerse itself entirely.  They may use
their magic on land (in a non-arid area) but suffer some diminution in
their abilities.  A character must have 18 MA to become a water mage.

\section{Base Chance Modifiers}

The Base Chance of performing any Talent, Spell or Ritual of this
College is modified by the addition of the following numbers.  Apply
one of the following:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={rX}}
+20	& Adept is completely immersed in water \\
+15	& Adept is in physical contact with water \\
+10	& Adept is within 25 feet of water \\
+5	& Adept is within 500 feet of water \\
+5	& Adept is surrounded by mist or fog, or is standing in the rain \\
-5	& Adept is on land and over 1 mile from water \\
-15	& Adept is on land and over 10 miles from water \\
\end{dqtblr}

This modifier may be applied in conjunction with one of the above:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={rX}}
-20	& All  water  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Adept  is frozen \\
\end{dqtblr}

\subsection{Notes}

\begin{Enumerate}
\item For the purpose of these modifiers “water” refers to a body of
  water such as a sea, lake, ocean, pond, river, stream, spring or
  other feature containing large amounts of water (1000 gallons or
  more) or existing as part of a larger system or network of
  waterways.  A barrel, bucket, or tun of water does not qualify as a
  body of water.

\item Apply the most advantageous modifier from the first group in
  conjunction with the frozen water modifier.
\end{Enumerate}


\section{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Predict Weather}

\range{10 miles (+10 / Rank)}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{MA + 5\% / Rank}
\begin{effects}
The Adept predicts with some accuracy what the weather will be like
over the ensuing three days in the area within the range of the
talent.  The Adept must be at sea (on an ocean, sea or large lake) or
within 15 miles of an ocean, sea or large lake.  If the Adept makes a
successful Predict Weather check, the GM rolls D100 and checks the
accuracy of the prediction.  The following results may occur:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={m{3em}X}}
Dice	& Accuracy \\
01--05	& Totally wrong (opposite of the prediction occurs) \\
06--10	& Generally incorrect (fairly wide divergence) \\
11--85	& Generally correct (close but not totally accurate) \\
86--100	& Almost totally accurate (say within 1 degree) \\
\end{dqtblr}

Following the dice roll the GM delivers the prediction as though it
were generally correct.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Dowsing}

\multiple{75}
\basechance{2 × MA + 4\% / Rank}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to sense the presence of water above ground, and
within 100 feet (+ 100 / Rank).  The Adept can determine the direction
and distance to the nearest source of water.  Detection of underground
water has a range of 1 feet (+ 2 / Rank).  Assessment of freshness
increases with increased Rank, e.g. Rank 3 can tell salt from fresh,
Rank 6 can tell alkali from clear, etc.  This talent may be exercised
when the Adept is in a vacuum or a totally arid place.  In general the
GM will roll to determine the success of this talent.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-3]{Aquatic Affinity}

\multiple{100}
\begin{effects}
Adepts of the College of Water Magic have a kinship with their element
which gives them the following abilities:
\begin{Enumerate}
\item The Adept may modify their swimming rolls by 4\% for every Rank
  they have achieved with this talent.

\item Above Rank 10, the Adept is considered to be an Aquatic entity
  for the purposes of calculating underwater defence.

\item Movement in water is considered to be one row less difficult on
  the Encumbrance table.  If the Adept has more than Rank 10 in this
  talent then it is two levels less difficult.

\item General knowledge of the Aquatic environment. 
\end{Enumerate}
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

The Adept summons water from deep within the earth, rising to the
surface in 100 seconds (-5 / Rank), causing the ground in an area of
100 feet (+10 / Rank) radius to become totally sodden.  Earth will
turn to mud.  Sand has a 30\% chance of turning into quicksand
(swallowing any trapped individuals in 20 seconds) and a 70\% chance
of turning into firm hard sand facilitating easy movement.  The Adept
may alter these chances by 1\% per Rank.  Wetlands will be unaffected

a small sail craft can be constructed out of available wood.  At Rank
15 or above, a large craft (40 feet or more in length) may be
constructed.  At the end of the spell’s duration, its effects are
undone; a constructed craft will fall apart (even in mid-ocean). In
addition, any craft which is affected by this spell has its chance of

aquatic life within range.  This communication usually consists of
both speech and gesture.  All members of the selected generic type of
aquatic that are within speaking range can be understood and can
understand the Adept. The Adept may have more than one spell on at
once, as long as they are for different generic types.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

eyes with a transparent film.  This allows the target to breathe and
see equally well under water as on land.  The target may cast spells
subject to the restrictions of their College. The spell does not
affect the target’s ability to operate on the surface.  This spell
allows vocal communication to a range of the target’s perception in
hexes.

\range{10 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{750}
\basechance{MA + 4\% / Rank}
\resist{Special}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can bind the element of water while maintaining their
concentration.  It takes an hour to perform this ritual.  The results
are similar to the binding of all other elements.  The Adept gains
control of all facets of the element. They can, for example, create an
intelligent water sprite (which will always have characteristics
several points lower than the Adept), however, its every action would
have to be directed by the Adept. At Rank 10 or higher, the Adept can
create a free-willed water sprite that will be loyal to them and not
require its every move be directed.  Such entities will never leave
the water.  The will not be resisted unless the area contains a Water
Elemental, which may passively and actively resist.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}


\section{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Control Aquatic Life}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Aquatic Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell allows the caster to control 1 (+ 1 / 2 Ranks) aquatic
creatures (which must be of the same generic type).  These creatures
will serve the caster so long as the caster concentrates or until they
are told to go away (move out of range of the spell).  A creature that
is no longer controlled but still in the vicinity may attack its
former master. If the target is of a particularly small, schooling
species, the Adept may be able to control the whole or part of the
school.  This spell cannot be used to control sentient creatures.
Aquatic Mammals are usually non-sentient.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Dehydration}

\range{20 feet + 20 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object, Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell must successfully resist or have all of the
water removed from their body, resulting in instant mummification.
The target’s corpse will remain preserved indefinitely (if kept dry,
since little or no tissue damage occurs). After rehydration the body
will be able to be resurrected as if it had just died.  If the target
is formerly or never living, the Adept receives +40\% on the Base
Chance. When used in this manner the spell can be used to dehydrate
such things as food for preservation, such things lasting indefinitely
if kept dry.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Flash Flood}

\range{600 feet + 600 / Rank}
\duration{30 seconds + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{2\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Watercourse}
\begin{effects}
The Adept causes a particular watercourse within range to swell and
burst its banks.  The watercourse can be a stream, dry river bed,
small or large river (i.e.  anywhere that might be subject to such an
occurrence naturally, including drains and sewers).  The flood will
occur with very little warning.  After 30 seconds of low rumblings,
the water level will suddenly rise, sweeping all before it.  The flood
will wipe out any small bridges and dams within range, wash people
away, unhorse riders, wash wagons and carts away (chance of
destruction dependent upon construction).  The effects are most
noticeable on small rivers or dry river beds. On a large river, the
flood might appear as a large wave which would look rather innocuous
at a distance but which would wreak just as much havoc.  After the
spell duration expires, the water level will drop just as quickly as
it rose.  All those caught in the flow must make a successful swimming
roll to avoid drowning.  If a person is unhorsed they must make a
horsemanship roll to stay with their horse, in which case they may use
the horse’s Rank in swimming (generally 8) to determine drowning.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Geyser}

\range{20 feet + 20 / Rank}
\duration{30 seconds + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Ground}
\begin{effects}
The Adept calls forth from the ground 1 (+ 1 / Rank) jets of hot steam
and mud. Each jet must appear in an adjacent hex to at least one other
jet.  Any Entity occupying an affected hex must resist or suffer [D -
  4] (+ 1 / 2 or fraction Ranks), half if resisted (round down),
damage, per pulse.  If a character resists they are allowed an
automatic hex of movement.  It is necessary to resist for each
separate hex passed through, however only 1 resistance check is
necessary for an individual hex regardless of the duration it is
occupied for. Magical Waterproofing or Protection from Normal Fire
will shield a character completely from any damage.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Liquid Purification}

\range{15 feet}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}

\target{Aqueous Liquid}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may turn 1 quart (+ 1 / Rank) of any aqueous liquid into
drinkable water.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Liquid Transmutation}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Potable water}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may turn 1 pint of drinkable water into any other common
liquid of their choice.  The quality of the transformed liquid is
dependent upon Rank (Rank 0, a wine might be made that was just
drinkable, Rank 10 a Silver or Gold Medal young wine, Rank 20, an
unsurpassed wine of its type).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Maelstrom}

\range{30 feet + 30 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume of Water}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a horrifying watery vortex with a diameter of 10
feet (+ 10 / Rank) which exists entirely within the spell’s range.
All objects and entities within 20 feet of the vortex must
successfully resist or they are sucked into the eye of the vortex and
down to the sea bottom. This spell will only be effective if cast over
a large body of water (sea, ocean or lake).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Rainstorm}

\range{20 feet + 20 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The caster summons a miniature rainstorm, radius 5 feet (+ 1 / Rank),
that appears over the target’s head (little dark rain cloud, tiny
lightning bolts and all). If the target fails to resist, the storm
will follow them for the duration (even inside buildings), completely
soaking everything not waterproof in 60 seconds (5 / Rank).  The
distrac- tion caused by the storm will add 2\% per Rank to any rolls
the target makes that are of a mental nature (i.e. require thought or
concentration) or 1\% per Rank to other rolls. All characters in the
area of effect will suffer these effects although the effects are
halved if they are not the actual target of the spell.  If the target
is waterproofed the effects will be minimal and if they are a Water
Mage they will suffer no ill effect, but will have their Base Chances
increased by 5\%. If the Adept chooses to cast this spell on himself
the duration is increased to 24 hours.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Storm Calling}

\range{Works at any Range}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Storm Front}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon any storm front which may exist anywhere in
sight. Upon reaching the spot occupied by the Adept at the time of
casting, the storm front will slow and finally cease moving and begin
to downpour (snow, rain, sleet, or whatever else the GM feels clouds
may contain).  Generally a storm front can be seen for 20 to 30
miles. If no front can be seen, the spell may still be cast but the
Base Chance is reduced by 20.  The storm front will take D10 × 3 (1 /
Rank) minutes to arrive.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Walk on Water}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}

\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target is able to walk on the surface of water as if it were solid
and non-slip.  They may travel at their normal TMR. Reduce TMR by 1
for every foot above 3 in wave height. In rough waters, agility rolls
may be deemed necessary (unless crawling).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Waters of Healing}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Special}
\target{Pint of water}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can turn 1 pint of water into a half pint healing potion.
This potion will immediately neutralise the effects of any venom, plus
it will cure 1 point of Endurance loss due to the venom.  Or, if there
are no venoms present, the Potion will cure [D - 5] (+ 1 / Rank)
damage (Endurance then Fatigue).  The Potion will last 2 minutes (+ 2
/ Rank). Or the Adept may spend an hour and utilise materials costing
200sp to make a Potion with the same effects that will last
indefinitely.  The ingredients are used up regardless of success or
failure.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-12]{Waters of Strength}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Special}
\target{Pint of water}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can turn 1 pint of water into a half pint strength potion.
This potion adds [D - 2] (+ 1 / Rank) to Physical Strength for 5
minutes (+ 5 / Rank).  Potions are not cumulative.  The Potion will
last 2 minutes (+ 2 / Rank). Or the Adept may spend an hour and
utilise materials costing 500sp to make a Potion with the same effects
that will last indefinitely. The ingredients are used regardless of
success or failure.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-13]{Waters of Vision}

\range{Touch}
\duration{10 seconds}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Pool of water}
\begin{effects}
The Adept must touch a pool of water with their hand.  They may then
view visions (usually precognitive in nature) concocted by the GM.  At
Rank 5 and above, they may use this technique to spy into an area to
see what is going on there. The maximum distance from the character to
the area being spied into is 5 miles (+ 15 / Rank). The point of view
of the Waters cannot be changed.  If the Adept is not able to form a
clear mental image of the location to be spied upon or command the
waters to focus on an unambiguously defined point in space, then it is
the GM’s discretion as to what will be seen
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-14]{Waterspout}
\range{60 feet + 60 / Rank}
\duration{30 seconds + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{750}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume of water}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a tornado-like formation with a radius of 5 feet (+
5 / Rank), over a body of water.  The waterspout kills anyone and
destroys anything which occupies the same space with it unless they
successfully resist.  The waterspout does [D - 1] (+ 1 / Rank) damage
to a character who resists successfully instead of inflicting enough
damage to kill them. A character need only resist the waterspout
once. Boats and ships will be affected at the GM’s discretion.  Small
boats may be broken into match sticks and will almost certainly
capsize, large ships may suffer less damage, but lose rigging, masts
etc.  If the Adept concentrates they may move the waterspout in any
direction they desire at a rate of 10 mph (+ 5 / Rank). It may never
be moved onto dry land.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-15]{Wave Riding}

\begin{effects}
This spell forms a wave of water under the target controlled by the
Adept, allowing travel up to 10 mph (+ 2 / Rank). This spell will only
form a wave on a suitably sized body of water.  Speed of current will
add/subtract to speed, wind will not.  The wave requires passive
concentration to maintain and to keep moving in the required
direction.  The wave dissipates if the Adept loses concentration.
Multiple casts of this spell may be maintained by the same passive
concentration action, thus several targets may ride the same wave (not
separate ones).

\basechance{MA +5\% / Rank +1\% WP above 15}
\resist{None}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon a Water Elemental and bind it to temporary
service by performing this ritual.  The ritual takes two hours.  It
may only be performed if the summoner is in contact with, or within 20
feet of, a large body of water (ocean, sea or lake) and the summoner
remains stationary and takes no other action during the time the
ritual is being performed. At the end of the two hour ritual, the
player makes a Cast Check.  If the ritual is successful the Elemental
is summoned and controlled.  If the ritual backfires then the
Elemental is summoned but not controlled and will attack the summoner
and their friends.

A Water Elemental always appears within 20 feet of the summoner. It
has a combined Endurance and Fatigue equal to 15 (+15 / Rank).  The
Elemental will remain until it is sent back to its own dimension by
the Adept (with a Special Knowledge Counterspell of the College of
Water Magics) or banished. If it is controlled by the summoner it will
remain controlled until the summoner’s concentration is broken.
