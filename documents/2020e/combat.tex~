Individual  Combat  is  an  inevitable  and  sometimes 
necessary  occurrence,  and  characters  should  be 
aware  of  its  dangers.  Fighting  is  a  deadly  process 
and should be avoided if at all possible. Heroes are 
made by defeating the dragon, but more graves are 
dug  than  heroes  made.  The  DragonQuest  combat 
system reflects these dangers and emphasises skills 
and smarts over brawn and brutality. 

When  combat has begun,  the  players  should place 
the  figures  representing  their  characters  on  the 
Tactical  Display,  with  the  GM  determining  their 
final position. The hostile figures are placed by the 
GM, and the Combat Sequence begins. 

Combat  time  on  the  Tactical  Display  is  divided 
into  five  second  Pulses  during  which  all  figures 
may  attempt  to  take  an  action,  depending  on  their 
position  relative  to  hostile  figures.  The  order  in 
which these actions take place is determined by the 
figures’  engaged  or  unengaged  Initiative  values. 
Attacks  are  resolved  by  comparing  the  attacker’s 
Modified  Strike  Chance  with  a  percentile  roll.  A 
successful  hit  does  D10  damage,  plus  any  bonus 
for weapon type and skill. 

When all figures on the Tactical Display are dead, 
unconscious,  incapacitated,  or  friendly  to  each 
other, the combat is finished. Combat should never 
last  longer  than  necessary  to  resolve  the  situation; 
returning  to  normal  interactive  roleplaying  will 
speed overall play. 

6.1 Definitions 
Action The movement and combat activity a figure 
may attempt during one pulse. 

Attacker  The  figure  performing  the  Action  cur-
rently being resolved. 

Attack  Zone  Any  hex  into  which  a  figure  may 
attack in Melee or at Range. 

Base  Chance  The  base  percentage  chance  of  hit-
ting with a weapon, as listed in the Weapon Chart 
(§56.1).

never part of an Attack Zone. 

Cast A Magical Action, used to Cast magic. 

in  Close  A  figure  in  the  same  hex  as  a  hostile 
figure is in Close with the opponent. 

Damage  Check  A  roll  on  a  D10  to  determine  the 
amount of damage done after a successful hit. This 
roll is modified by the weapon, the Rank or Physi-
cal  Strength  of  the  wielder,  circumstances  and 
magic. 

Damage  Points  The  number  of  points  of  damage 
done as a result of a damage check. 

Defence  The  amount  that  a  target  may  subtract 
from  an  Attacker’s  Strike  Chance,  determined  by 
Modified Agility, a shield, magic and conditions. 

6 COMBAT 

Effective  Damage  Any  Damage  Points  (to  either 
Fatigue or Endurance) that are actually inflicted on 
the  figure  hit  after  allowing  for  absorption  due  to 
armour or magic. 

Engaged A figure who is in the Melee Zone of an 
opponent, or is in Close, is engaged.

Target  The  figure  on  the  receiving  end  of  any 
Attacker’s action. 

Facing  A  figure  must  be  unambiguously  oriented

into, but through which objects may pass. 

Pass Action Any preparatory  Action that does not 
directly  affect  another  figure  and  is  not  otherwise 
covered by specific Actions. 

Preparing a Spell A type of Magical Pass Action 

Prepared  Item  Any  item  (weapon,  shield,  flask, 
etc.)  that  a  figure  has  in  their  hands  and  may  im-

opponent,  or  who  is  not  in  an  opponent’s  melee 
zone and chooses to be unengaged. 

Weapon Any item used to Strike a figure. 

6.2 Preparation for Combat 

Paperwork 

Character  Sheets  for  all  combatants  should  be 
prepared  before  the  combat.  These  contain  infor-
mation that will be used continuously during com-
bat, such as Strike Chances, Initiatives, Movement 
Rates, etc. A player is responsible for ensuring the 
completeness  and  accuracy  of  the  information  on 
their Character Sheet, while the GM should prepare 
this  information  for  all  NPCs  in  advance.  Any 
damage  or  other  losses  in  combat  should  be  re-
corded as the combat proceeds. Percentile dice and 
copies  of  all  charts  and  tables  should  be  available 
for  ready  usage.  Lead  figures  or  counters  for  all 
combatants  should  also  be  available,  as  these  add 
to the clarity and excitement of a combat. 

Surprise 

One  side  in  a  combat  may  gain  a  free  pulse  of 
activity  if  it  surprises  the  other.  If  one  side  in  a 
combat is unaware of either the opposition’s intent 
or  their  location,  they  are  surprised  unless  the 
figure  with  the  highest  effective  Perception  suc-
ceeds in making a Perception Check. This Percep-
tion  check  is  modified  by  both  Ranger  Detect 
Ambush and the Sense Danger Talent. 

Prior  to  placing  any  figures  on  the  Tactical  Dis-
play,  the  GM  should  determine  whether  surprise 
exists.  If  one  side  is  surprised,  they  should  place 
their  figures  in  a  way  that  represents  their  lack  of 
readiness.  If  no  surprise  exists,  the  players  may 
place  their  figures  as  they  choose,  then  the  GM 
places  the  opposing  figures,  with  the  GM  having 
the  final  say  on  all  placements.  As  a  guideline,  if 
there  is  surprise,  the  distance  between  the  two 
parties should not exceed 8 hexes, while if there is 
no  surprise,  the  distance  should  not be  less  than  8 
hexes. 

If surprise exists, the party with the advantage may 
have  a  free  pulse  of  activity  without  the  surprised 
party being able to respond; otherwise, the normal 
Combat Sequence starts. 

Fatigue 

After placing all the figures on the Tactical Display 
the GM must assign any Fatigue losses the figures 
may have incurred as a result of their actions prior 
to  combat.  For  player  characters,  this  should  have 
been  recorded  as  they  slept,  rested,  travelled,  cast 
magic or attempted other fatiguing actions. For all 
NPCs, the GM should make a quick estimate relat-
ing  all  presumed  activity  they  may  have  under-
taken up to the start of combat. 

6.3 Combat Sequence 
The  order  in  which  all  actions  are  attempted  in  a 
pulse  is  called  the  Combat  Sequence.  This  se-
quence should be adhered to at all times as this will 
greatly speed play. Each pulse, events occur in the 
following order: 

1.  Unengaged  Initiative  is  determined  for  each 
side. 

2.  If  any  figures  are  engaged  or  in  Close,  these 
figures  are  grouped  into  Engagements,  and  each 
Engagement is dealt with separately. 

6 COMBAT 

3.  In  each  Engagement,  engaged  Initiative  is  de-
termined, and then the figures act in order of Initia-
tive  (highest  to  lowest),  each  performing  one  Ac-
tion from the Engaged Actions list. 

4.  The  winner  of  the  unengaged  Initiative  now 
resolves the Actions (selected from the Unengaged 
Actions List) of all their unengaged figures, in any 
order  they  choose.  All  their  actions  must  be  re-
solved before any figures on the opposing side may 
act. 

5. Remaining unengaged figures may act as in Step 
4. 

6.  End  of  Pulse  activity  occurs.  This  may  include 
an additional stun recovery attempt for figures that 
were Stunned during the Pulse and any housekeep-
ing. 

Exceptions to the Combat Sequence 

Engaged  Figures  becoming  Unengaged  If  a 
figure  becomes  unengaged  before  their  engaged 
Action  is  resolved,  they  must  act  on  their  unen-
gaged  Initiative.  If  they  become  unengaged  after 
they  have  had  their  engaged  Action,  they  do  not 
gain an extra Action. 

Unengaged  Figures  becoming  Engaged  If  a 
figure  becomes  engaged  before  their  unengaged 
Action  is  resolved,  they  must  select  an  engaged 
Action on their unengaged Initiative. 

Optionally  Engaged  Figures  A  figure  who  is 
adjacent to a hostile figure, but is not in any oppo-
nent’s  Melee  Zone,  may  choose  whether  to  be 
treated  as  engaged  or  unengaged,  and  acts  on  the 
appropriate Initiative. 

Extraordinarily Agile Figures A figure who has a 
modified  Agility  of  26  or  more  may  perform  two 
Actions on their initiative. Their choice of Actions 
is restricted. See §6.8. 

Stunned Figures If a figure is Stunned before their 
Action, they may attempt to Recover from Stun as 
their  Action.  This  takes  place  when  specified  for 
Stunned figures in the Initiative Section below. If a 
figure  is  Stunned  during  the  Pulse  they  may  at-
tempt to Recover from Stun at the end of the Pulse 
in which they were Stunned, regardless of whether 
they acted or not. 

Initiative 

Engaged  Initiative  A  figure’s  engaged  Initiative 
Value is their modified Agility + Perception + their 
Rank  with  prepared  weapon  +  Warrior  bonus.  If 
the  figure  has  no  prepared  weapon,  they  may  use 
their  Unarmed  Rank.  Any  ties  indicate  simultane-
ous  combat.  In  each  Engagement,  figures  with 
faster initiative may choose to act after figures with 
lower  initiative,  but  all  engaged  Actions  must  be 
resolved  before  any  unengaged  Actions.  If  an 
engaged  figure  is  not  in  any  opponent’s  Melee 
Zone,  they  may  act  first  in  the  engagement.  If  a 
figure is Stunned they act last in their Engagement. 

Unengaged  Initiative  A  side’s  unengaged  Initia-
tive is their leader’s Perception + D10. If the leader 
is  a  Military  Scientist,  they  gain  a  bonus  to  this 
roll. Any ties are re-rolled. The leader may choose 
to  have  their  entire  party  act  after  a  slower  side. 
This  decision  is  made  before  any  engaged  actions 
are resolved. If a side’s leader is engaged, Stunned 
or  otherwise  incapacitated  at  this  point,  another 
character may assume this role. All figures who are 
under  a  single  Leader  take  their  Actions  in  the 
same Initiative, in any order that they find conven-
ient. A Stunned figure always acts last in their side. 

Action Timing 

When  a  figure  chooses  an  Action,  they  are  as-
sumed to be performing that Action until they start 
a new action or are stunned. However, any Action 
which  requires  a  dice  roll  to  resolve  is  completed 
when  that  dice  roll  is  made;  the  figure  is  assumed 
to  be  engaged  in  follow-up  manoeuvres  until  their 
next  action.  After  successfully  recovering  from 
Stun,  a  figure  is  assumed  to  have  just  finished  a 
Pass  Action  until  their  next  Action,  for  all  pur-

poses, and any previously prepared shield or weap-
ons are once again prepared. 

GM Conventions 

These  are  only  conventions;  the  GM  may  modify 
these conventions to suit their own style. 

Announcements  of  Intent  When  combat  occurs 
on  the  Tactical  Display,  there  should  be  no  lapses 
of time between player announcements of character 
intentions  and  resolution  of  them.  When  it  is  a 
character’s  turn  to  take  action,  the  player  must 
announce  within  5  seconds  what  their  character 
will  do,  or  the  character  will  take  a  Pass  Action. 
The  GM  should  restrict  themselves  to  a  similar 
guideline for their NPCs. A player may change the 
action they announced for their character to a Pass 
Action  (only)  up  to  five  seconds  after  they  an-
nounce it. 

Discussions during Combat If the players wish to 
discuss  tactics  amongst  themselves,  they  must  do 
so  quietly  while  the  GM  is  determining  the  result 
of a particular action. Anything said by one charac-
ter to another during combat may be overheard. A 
Military  Scientist  character  may  allow  a  party  a 
Time-out during which they will not be overheard. 

Rule  Clarification  Any  player  may,  at  the  GM’s 
discretion, suspend the passage of time by request-
ing  a  clarification  of  a  relevant  point  by  the  GM. 
They may also appeal a decision made by the GM 
that  they  feel  to  be  arbitrarily  or  improperly  re-
solved.  The  player  has  as  much  time  as  the  GM 
may  grant.  The  GM  may  modify  or  reverse  their 
decision,  or  stand  behind  it.  The  GM’s  word  is 
always law. 

6.4 Engaged Actions 
Being  engaged  imposes  certain  limitations  on  the 
actions  that  a  figure  may  attempt.  The  primary 
restriction is that an engaged figure may not move 
out  of  the  Melee  Zone  of  an  opponent  except  in 
special  circumstances.  If  an  engaged  figure  is  in 
Close  Combat,  their  range  of  Actions  is  further 
restricted. 

The order in which the Actions of engaged figures 
is resolved is determined by each figure’s engaged 
Initiative. 

Melee Attack 

An engaged figure may move one hex and change 
facing, and then attempt a Melee Attack. They may 
not move after they have attacked. 

Close \& Grapple 

An  engaged  figure  may  attempt  to  Close  \&  Grap-
ple. If the Attacker is within the Melee Zone of the 
target,  they  may  try  to  Repulse  the  Attacker’s 
attempt  to  Close  by  rolling  less  than  or  equal  to 
their  prepared  Melee  weapon  Rank  on  a  D10. 
Multihex  figures  may  not  be  Repulsed,  but  the 
defending figure may avoid the attack by succeed-
ing in a 1 × AG check. 

A  successful  Repulse  means  that  the  target  has 
interposed  their  weapon  between  themselves  and 
the  Attacker,  and  the  action  has  failed.  If  the  Re-
pulse  is  unsuccessful,  the  Attacker  may  go  into 
Close and make a normal Grapple attack. 

Evade 

An engaged figure may move one hex and change 
facing while executing an Evade. If a Melee Attack 
is  attempted  on  a  figure  who  is  Evading  with  a 
Ranked  weapon,  they  may  be  able  to  Parry  the 
attack.  An  Evading  figure  receives  a  bonus  to 
Defence versus Melee and Ranged Attacks. 

Offensive Withdraw 

An engaged figure may make a Melee Attack with 
a  -20  penalty  to  their  Strike  Chance.  They  may 
then  move  one  hex  and  change  facing.  They  may 
freely  leave  the  Melee  Zone  of  any  opponent,  but 
may not move into that opponent’s rear hex. 

Defensive Withdraw 

An  engaged  figure  may  solely  defend,  increasing 
their defence by 20. They may then move one hex 

16 

and  change  facing.  They  may  freely  leave  the 
Melee  Zone  of  any  opponent,  but  may  not  move 
into that opponent’s rear hex. 

Flee 

An engaged figure who does not have an opponent 
in  their  Melee  Zone  may  Flee.  This  allows  them 
the same options as  

an unengaged Move.  Any  opponent able  to  Melee 
attack the figure automatically receives Initiative. 

Pass 

An engaged figure may move one hex and change 
facing while performing a Pass Action. 

Cast 

An  engaged  figure  may  change  facing  but  not 
move while attempting to Cast a Spell. Casting is a 
Magical  Action.  Like  all  other  actions,  Casting  is 
resolved on the figure’s initiative. 

Throw 

An  engaged  figure  may  change  facing  but  not 
move  while  attempting  to  Throw  a  weapon.  They 
may  only  Throw  into  their  Ranged  Zone  where 
they have a Line of Fire. 

Recover from Stun 

An  engaged  figure  who  is  stunned  may  attempt  to 
recover  from  Stun.  They  may  not  make  any 
movement or change facing. 

Leaving Melee Combat 

A figure engaged in Melee Combat may only leave 
Melee Combat by (i) executing a Close \& Grapple, 
(ii) executing a Withdraw or  Flee, or (iii) by stun-
ning or otherwise incapacitating all opponents who 
have  the  figure  in  their  Melee  Zones.  Other  Ac-
tions  may  never  take  the  figure  out  of  any  hostile 
Melee Zone. 

6.5 Close Combat Actions 
All figures in Close Combat are treated as engaged. 
However, while in Close, only close-rated weapons 
may be employed. All other weapons or items must 
be dropped immediately. Figures in Close Combat 
are treated as prone, and thus have no Melee Zone 
or facing. 

If  an  engaged  figure  is  in  Close  Combat,  their 
Action is limited to one of the following: 

Grapple 

A  figure  engaged  in  Close  Combat  may  neither 
move  nor  change  facing  while  attempting  a  Grap-
ple.  A  Grapple  is  an  attack  with  any  close-rated 
weapon (including Unarmed). 

Withdraw from Close 

A  figure  may  attempt  to  Withdraw  from  Close 
Combat. If they are successful, they may move one 
hex,  but  are  still  treated  as  prone.  A  figure  may 
Withdraw  from  Close  if  a  D10  roll  plus  any  posi-
tive  difference  in  total  Physical  Strength  between 
the friendly and hostile figures in the hex is at least 
10. 

Pass 

A  figure  engaged  in  Close  Combat  may  neither 
move  nor  change  facing  while  taking  a  Pass  Ac-
tion. They may not attempt a  Magical Pass Action 
or  Multi-Pulse  Action.  Some  other  Pass  Actions 
will be impossible, as they are effectively prone. 

Recover from Stun 

A figure engaged in Close Combat who is stunned 
may  attempt  to  recover  from  Stun  as  their  Close 
Combat Action. 

Leaving Close Combat 

A  figure  engaged  in  Close  Combat  may  leave 
Close  Combat  by  (i)  executing  a  Withdraw  from 
Close, or (ii) by stunning or otherwise incapacitat-
ing all opponents who are in Close with the figure. 

6.6 Unengaged Actions 
An unengaged figure is one that is not engaged. 

Move 

Recover from Stun 

An  unengaged  figure  may  move  any  number  of 
hexes up to their TMR. During movement, a figure 
may change facing as desired. 

An  unengaged  figure  who  is  stunned  may  attempt 
to  recover  from  Stun.  They  may  not  make  any 
movement or change facing. 

Step \& Melee Attack 

An  unengaged  figure  may  move  one  hex  and 
change  facing,  and  then  attempt  to  Melee  Attack. 
They may not move after they have attacked. 

Charge 

An  unengaged  figure  may  move  up  to  1/2  TMR 
and  attempt  to  Melee  Attack  with  a  non-pole 
weapon.  At  the  end  of  the  figure’s  movement,  if 
there  is  a  hostile  figure  in  the  Attacker’s  Melee 
Zone,  they  may  make  a  Melee  Attack  with  a  -15 
penalty  to  Strike  Chance.  The  figure  may  not 
change facing after the Melee Attack. 

Charge with Pole Weapon or Shield 

An  unengaged  figure  may  move  up  to  TMR  and 
attempt  to  Melee  Attack  with  a  pole  weapon  or 
Shield.  At  the  end  of  the  figure’s  movement,  if 
there  is  a  hostile  figure  in  the  Attacker’s  Melee 
Zone,  they  may  make  a  Melee  Attack  with  a  +20 
bonus  to  Strike  Chance.  The  figure  must  move  at 
least 2 hexes, and may not change facing after the 
Melee  Attack.  This  action  may  not  be  attempted 
with a Tower Shield or a Main Gauche. 

Charge \& Close 

An  unengaged  figure  may  move  up  to  1/2  TMR 
and  attempt  to  Close.  If  the  figure  passes  through 
the Melee Zone of the target, the target may try to 
Repulse  the  figure  in the  same  way  as  for  a Close 
\& Grapple. 

If  the  Repulse  is  successful,  the  target  has  inter-
posed  their  weapon  between  themselves  and  the 
Attacker.  If  the  Attacker  cannot  or  will  not  stop 
entering  Close,  the  target  automatically  inflicts  a 
potential Specific Grievous Injury on the Attacker. 

If the Repulse is unsuccessful, the Attacker may go 
into  Close,  and  may  attempt  a  normal  Grapple 
action or a Trample attack. 

Evade 

An  unengaged  figure  may  move  up  to  1/2  TMR 
and  change  facing  while  executing  an  Evade.  If  a 
Melee attack is attempted on a figure who is Evad-
ing  with  a  Ranked  weapon,  they  may  be  able  to 
Parry  the  attack.  An  Evading  figure  receives  a 
bonus  to  Defence  versus  Melee  and  Ranged  At-
tacks. 

Retreat 

An unengaged figure may Retreat, increasing their 
defence  by  20.  They  may  move  up  to  2  hexes 
backwards and change facing. 

Pass 

An  unengaged  figure  may  move  two  hexes  and 
change facing while performing a Pass Action. 

Cast 

An unengaged figure may not move while attempt-
ing to Cast a Spell, but may change facing. Like all 
other  actions,  Casting  is  resolved  on  the  figure’s 
initiative. Casting is a Magical Action. 

Throw 

An unengaged figure may move up to 2 hexes and 
change  facing  while  attempting 
to  Throw  a 
weapon.  They  may  only  Throw  into  their  Ranged 
Zone where they have a Line of Fire. 

Fire 

An unengaged figure may not move while attempt-
ing to Fire a missile weapon, but may change fac-
ing.  Once  a  Crossbow  is  prepared  and  loaded,  a 
figure  may  carry  it  around  and  fire whenever  they 
wish. In this instance, the figure may move up to 2 
hexes  either  before  or  after  firing.  All  missile 
weapons  need  to  be  Loaded  before  they  may  be 
Fired.  The  figure  may  only  Fire  into  their  Ranged 
Zone where they have a Line of Fire. 

6.7 Free Acts 
In  addition  to  their  normal  Action,  a  figure  may 
always drop whatever they have in their hands and, 
if not performing a Magical Action, they may say a 
short phrase during their Action. 

6.8 Action Restrictions 
Movement  may  be  restricted  by  terrain  or  other 
conditions. Figures with a modified Agility of 8 or 
less  may  have  their  movement  reduced  when  per-
forming other Actions, while those with a modified 
Agility of 22 or more may gain extra movement or 
Actions. Figures who become stunned or otherwise 
incapacitated  may  not  attempt  normal  Actions, 
except that stunned figures may attempt to recover 
from  Stun  as  their  Action.  The  type  of  Action  a 
figure may attempt is restricted by their position on 
the Tactical Display, and their visibility. The use of 
magic in combat is subject to restrictions, and may 
in some cases be impossible. 

Movement 

Any complicated turning manoeuvre  may result in 
a reduction in the figure’s movement allowance for 
that  pulse.  A  reduction  of  1  hex  is  suggested  for 
each 180◦ turn. At the end of the Action, the figure 
must  be  unambiguously  oriented  towards  one  hex 
side. 

A  figure’s  movement  allowance  assumes  a  flat 
surface  with  little  or  no  hindrance  to  movement. 
Some  terrain  is  not  conductive  to  quick  traversal, 
and  the  figure  should  suffer  a  reduction  to  move-
ment in such conditions. A figure should normally 
be able to move at least 1 hex per pulse, no matter 
what the terrain. 

If  a  figure  enters  the  Melee  Zone  of  any  hostile 
figure,  they  become  engaged,  and  must  stop 
movement,  though  they  may  change  facing.  If  the 
figure  is  performing  a  Charge  \&  Close,  they  may 
attempt  to  enter  Close,  but  the  opponent’s  hex 
counts as a hex of movement. 

If  a  figure  wishes  to  jump during  their  movement, 
they  should  have  their  movement  allowance  re-
duced, and the figure must make an Agility Check 
to land cleanly. 

Often  two  or  more  friendly  figures  will  wish  to 
pass  through  a  hex  at  the  same  time,  or  need  to 
squeeze  past  each  other  in the  same hex.  The  GM 
should  judge  whether  circumstances  permit  this, 
and if  so,  whether  the  figures  are  hindered.  If  nei-
ther  figure  is  endeavouring  to  do  more  than  move 
through  the  hex,  there  will  usually  be  little  prob-
lem,  but  more  dangerous  manoeuvres  may  reduce 
movement or require Agility Checks. 

A  figure may move backwards at half their move-
ment rate, and crawl at 1/4 rate. 

Pass Actions 

A Pass Action is any generic non-attacking action a 
figure may attempt which is not otherwise covered 
by  specific  Actions.  Typical  Pass  Actions  include: 
preparing an item or weapon, putting an item away, 
picking up a dropped item, mounting or dismount-
ing  a  steed,  loading  a  missile  weapon,  drinking 
from a flask, dropping to one knee or prone, rising 
up, etc. 

Pass Actions also include Multi-Pulse Actions and 
the following Magical Pass Actions:  
• Prepare Spell (see §7.3).  

• Actively Resist (see §7.8).  

• Concentrate (see §7.6). 

Typical 

Actions:  The  following  list  is  intended  as  a  guide 
for the GM to be able to judge how many pulses an 
attempted  Action  will  take  to  perform.  Note  that 
some  Actions  that  figures  in  combat  wish  to  at-
tempt will take far more than one pulse.

Figures with Low Agility 

Figures  with  modified  Agility  of  8  or  less  are  al-
lowed  one  less  hex  of  movement  when  executing 
any  of  the  following  Actions:  engaged  Melee  At-
tack, engaged Evade, Retreat, Pass, Fire Crossbow, 
Throw. 

Figures with High Agility 

Figures with modified Agility of 22 through 25 are 
allowed  one  extra  hex  of  movement  when  execut-
ing  any  of  the  following  Actions:  Melee  Attack, 
engaged  Evade,  Withdraw,  Retreat,  Pass,  Fire 
Crossbow, Throw. 

Figures with Extraordinary Agility 

Figures with a modified Agility of 26 or more may 
perform  an  additional  defensive  withdraw,  retreat 
or  non-magical  pass  action  except  when  Stunned. 
The  actions  are  resolved  consecutively,  in  either 
order. The figure’s total movement may not exceed 
their TMR. 

Stunned Figures 

A  figure  who  becomes  Stunned  may  only  take 
Recover  from  Stun  as  their  Action.  A  figure  who 
was  Stunned  during  the  Pulse  gets  an  additional 
attempt  to  Recover  from  Stun  at  the  end  of  that 
Pulse.  They  may  still  take  free  Acts.  The  Base 
Chance  of  Recovering  from  Stun  is  2  ×  WP  + 
current FT. A stunned figure has no Melee Zone. 

Position of Opposing Figures 

The  type  of  Action  a  figure  may  attempt  is  re-
stricted  by  the  position  of  the  nearest  opposing 
figure.  If  a  figure  is  in  the  same  hex  as  a  hostile 
figure,  they  are  in  Close,  and  may  only  select  an 
Action from §6.5. If a figure is in a hostile figure’s 
Melee Zone and is not in Close, they are engaged, 
and  may  only  select  an  Action  from  §6.4.  If  a 
figure  is  not  in  a  hostile  figure’s  Melee  Zone,  but 
has a target in their Melee Zone, they may select an 
Action from either §6.4 or §6.6, depending on how 
they  wish  to  be  treated.  Otherwise,  a  figure  is  un-
engaged, and must select an Action from §6.6. 

Visibility 

If  a  figure  is  attempting  to  perform  a  Melee  or 
Ranged  Attack  on  a  hostile  figure  who  occupies  a 
hex  that  is  obscured  (due  to  smoke,  magic,  etc.), 
they  may  be  affected  by  visibility  modifiers  (see 
§57.1).  If  they  are  attempting  to  cast  a  spell  that 
requires  targeting,  they  must  make  a  Perception 
Check.  If  the  figure  is  totally  obscured,  they  are 
treated as invisible for Strike Chances, and may not 
normally  be  targeted  by  a  target:  Entity  spell.  The 
GM  must  determine  if  a  figure  is  affected  by  an 
Area or Line of Fire spell, or Ranged Attack. 

6 COMBAT 

Disturbing Magical Actions 

If an Adept is performing a Magical Action, and is 
attacked,  they  must  make  a  Concentration  Check 
(see  §7.6)  or  their  Action  will  fail.  If  the  Adept  is 
stunned  or  has  sufficient  cold  iron  lodged  within 
them,  their  Action  will  automatically  fail.  An 
Adept may not cast while prone. 

Action Summary 

The Action Summary (§57.3) lists all valid Actions 
and their Restrictions. 

6.9 Attacking 
The order of all attacking Actions is determined by 
the Initiative procedure as detailed in §6.3. Combat 
involving  engaged  figures  is  always  resolved  be-
fore  any  combat  involving  unengaged  figures.  An 
attacker’s weapon is always assumed to be held in 
their  primary  hand  unless stated  otherwise.  Empty 
bare  hands  are  always  considered  a  prepared 
weapon. 

A hostile figure may be attacked by Ranged, Melee 
or  Close  combat  while  on  the  Tactical  Display. 
Special  types  of  attacks  are  allowed,  and  these 
include  Multi-hex  Strikes,  Multiple  Weapon 
Strikes, and attempting to Trip, Entangle, Restrain, 
Knockout, Shield Rush or Disarm. 

Ranged Attacks 

A  figure  may  attempt  to  attack  a  hostile  figure  in 
their Ranged Zone via ranged combat by executing 
a  Fire  or  Throw  Action.  The  figure  declares  their 
target, determines and applies any Ranged Combat 
modifiers (see §57.1), and executes a Strike Check. 

To Fire a missile weapon, the figure must be armed 
with  a  prepared  and  loaded  missile  weapon.  To 
Throw a  weapon, the figure must be armed with a 
prepared  weapon  rated  for  ranged  combat.  The 
figure must have a Line of Fire to the target. If the 
Line  of  Fire  contains  an  obscured  hex,  the  figure 
may not Aim, and treats the target as if invisible. 

Whenever  the  weapon  enters  a  hex  occupies  by  a 
figure or object (other than a solid obstacle that the 
missile  must hit),  there  is  a  chance  (as determined 
by  the  GM)  that  the  weapon  will  hit  the  figure  or 
object instead of continuing its flight. This must be 
resolved  for  each  figure  occupying  any  hex  along 
the Line of Fire until the weapon hits something or 
loses momentum and falls to the ground. 

A  figure  cannot  check  a  Line  of  Fire  without  exe-
cuting  an  Aim,  Fire  or  Throw  action,  whether  or 
not the weapon is actually loosed. 

Snapshooting A figure with a prepared Short Bow, 
Long  Bow,  Composite  Bow,  Giant  Bow  or  Sling, 
with  which  they  are  at  least  Rank  3,  may  prepare 
an arrow or bullet and Fire in the same Action. The 
Strike Chance is reduced by -15. Snapshooting is a 
Fire Action. 

Aiming  A  figure  with  a  prepared  and  loaded  mis-
sile  weapon  may  choose  to  take  a  Pass  Action  to 
Aim the missile weapon at a particular target. If the 
figure then Fires at that target in their next Action, 
their  Strike  Chance  is  increased  by  +20,  and  in 
addition,  the  chances  of  causing  Endurance  or 
Specific  Grievous  damage  are  increased  to  20% 
and  10%  of  the  modified  Strike  Chance,  respec-
tively. 

Melee Attacks 

A  figure  may  attempt to  Melee  Attack  any  hostile 
figure who occupies at least one hex of their Melee 
Zone.  The  figure  declares  their  target,  determines 
and  applies  any  Melee  Combat  modifiers  (see 
§57.1),  and  executes  a  Strike  Check  with  a  pre-
pared melee-rated weapon. The attacker may move 
adjacent to the target during that pulse. 

The normal Melee attack is intended to do as much 
damage to the target as possible, but other forms of 
specialised attack exist. 

Close Combat Attacks 

A  figure  may  attempt  to  attack  any  figure  who 
occupies  the  same  hex  via  Close  Combat  by  exe-

cuting  a  Grapple  Action.  The  figure  declares  their 
target,  determines  and  applies  any  Close  Combat 
modifiers (see §57.1), and executes a Strike Check 
with  a  prepared  close-rated  weapon.  The  attacker 
may  move  into  the  target’s  hex  during  the  pulse; 
this is known as closing. 

by -20. If the attack is successful, one point of EN 
is  inflicted,  and  the  target  must  roll  under  (MD  + 
Rank)  or  drop  a  weapon  or  item  of  the  attacker’s 
choice.  If  the  item is  being  held  in  two  hands, the 
check is (2 × MD + Rank). A figure may not move 
while attempting a Disarm. 

Attacking into Combat 

A  Ranged  attack  on  a  figure  in  Melee  combat  is 
resolved  normally,  bearing  in  mind  the  Line  of 
Sight  restrictions.  A  Ranged  or  Melee  attack  on  a 
figure  in Close  combat  suffers  a  penalty  of  -10.  If 
the  attack  misses,  an  additional  attack  with  the 
same  penalty  must  be  resolved  against  each  re-
maining figure in that hex (in a random order). If a 
multi-hex creature is in close with single-hex crea-
tures, it may be targeted normally. 

Special Attacks 

A figure may attempt to attack using any one of the 
following special attacks. 

Multiple  Strike  A  figure  who  is  armed  with  two 
prepared weapons (one in each hand) may attempt 
a  Multiple  Strike.  The  two  weapons  need  not  be 
targeted against the same opponent, but must be of 
the  same  type  (Ranged,  Melee  or  Close).  The 
Strike Chance of the Primary weapon is reduced by 
-10,  while  the  Strike  Chance  of  the  Secondary 
weapon  is  reduced  by  -30.  Ambidextrous  figures 
suffer a -10 penalty with each attack. A figure may 
not move while making a Multiple Strike. 

Multi-hex  Strike  A  figure  who  has  a  prepared 
two-handed B-class weapon, with which they are at 
least  Rank  4,  may  strike  up  to  three  figures  in 
adjacent  hexes  in  their  Melee  Zone.  Their  Strike 
Chance is reduced by -20 on each attack. A figure 
may not move while making a Multi-hex Strike. 

Trip A figure  with a prepared Quarterstaff, Spear, 
Halberd,  Poleaxe  or  Glaive  may  attempt  to trip an 
opponent in their Melee Zone. The Base Chance is 
reduced  to  40%,  and  the  damage  to  D10.  If  the 
attack is successful, the target must make a 3 × AG 
Check  or  fall  prone.  This  attack  may  not  be  at-
tempted  on  a  target  significantly  larger  than  the 
attacker. A figure may not move before attempting 
a Trip. 

Entangle  A  figure  with  a  prepared  Net,  Whip, 
Lasso or Bola may attempt to Entangle their oppo-
nent  during  any  attack.  If  the  attack  is  successful, 
the target must make a 3 × AG Check or fall prone. 
The  target  must  disentangle  themselves  before 
rising, requiring 2 Pass Actions. 

Restrain  A  figure  may  attempt  to  restrain  an  op-
ponent  by  pinning  them  to  the  ground.  The  Base 
Chance  is  three  times  the  difference  in total  PS  \& 
AG between the attacker(s) and their opponent. No 
damage  is  done.  A  restrained  figure  is  treated  as 
incapacitated,  and  remains  restrained  until  the 
restraint  is  broken  by  an  attack  from  outside  the 
hex  that  does  effective  damage  to  a  restrainer.  A 
Restrain may only be attempted in Close Combat. 

Knockout A figure with any prepared Melee rated 
weapon excluding entangling weapons, Lances and 
Pikes,  may  attempt  to  knock  out  their  opponent. 
The attack is successful if the Strike Check would 
normally  result  in  an  Endurance  blow  (see  §6.11). 
No  damage  is  done,  but  the  target  is  unconscious 
for  [D  +  5]  minutes.  This  attack  may  not  be  at-
tempted  on  a  target  significantly  larger  than  the 
attacker.  A  figure  may  not  move  while  attempting 
a Knockout. 

Shield Rush A figure with a prepared shield (other 
than a Main Gauche or Tower Shield) may attempt 
to Shield Rush their opponent. If the attack is suc-
cessful,  the  target  must  make  a  3  ×  AG  Check  or 
fall  prone.  This  attack  may  not  be  attempted  on  a 
target  significantly  larger  than  the  attacker.  A 
figure  must  move  at  least  one  hex  before  attempt-
ing a Shield Rush. 

Disarm  A figure may attempt to Disarm an oppo-
nent  with  any  prepared  Melee  or  Close  rated 
weapon. The Strike Chance of the attack is reduced 

18 

6.10 Resolving Attempted Attacks 
Every weapon and attack form has a Base Chance. 
The  Base  Chance  with all  modifiers applied  is  the 
Modified  Strike  Chance.  The  attacker  performs  a 
Strike  Check  by  rolling  D100;  if  the  result  is  less 
than  or  equal  to  the  Modified  Strike  Chance,  the 
attack  has  been  successful;  above  and  the  attack 
has missed. Particularly poor rolls may result in the 
weapon being broken or dropped. Once a success-
ful hit has been made, a Damage Check occurs. 

If the target is Evading, the attacker has a reduced 
strike  chance  and,  if  they  miss,  they  may  be  Dis-
armed or Riposted. 

Strike Chance 

When  attacking  with  any  Ranked  weapon,  the 
Strike  Chance  is  (Weapon  Base  Chance)  +  (Mod. 
Manual  Dexterity)  +  (4  ×  Rank).  When  attacking 
with  an  unranked  weapon,  the  Strike  Chance  is 
equal  to  the  Base  Chance.  Wild  creatures  using 
natural  attack  forms  such  as  teeth,  claws,  etc., 
always add their Manual Dexterity + (4 × Rank). 

Modified Strike Chance 

An  attacker’s  Modified  Strike  Chance  is  equal  to 
their  Strike  Chance  plus  any  modifications  for 
attack  type  and  conditions,  minus  the  target’s  cur-
rent defence. If the attacker rolls less than or equal 
to the Modified Strike Chance, a successful hit has 
occurred,  and  a  Damage  Check  is  made  (see 
§6.11). 

Attack  condition  modifiers  are  detailed  in  (§57.1 
Strike Chance Modifiers). 

Evading 

If  a  figure  evades,  their  Defence  against  Melee 
attacks increases by 10 + 4 / Rank of their prepared 
Melee  weapon,  and  their  Defence  against  Missile 
attacks increases by 20. 

If  a  figure  is  Evading,  and  an  opponent  in  their 
Melee  Zone  misses  an  attack  at  them  by  30  or 
more, they may choose to try to Parry the attack. 

The target rolls D10, adds the Rank of the prepared 
weapon  they  are  Evading  with,  and  subtracts  the 
Rank of the attacker’s weapon. If this result is 3 or 
less,  the  attack  has  been  successfully  Parried,  but 
the  target  has  been  thrown  off  balance,  and  their 
next  action  must  be  a  pass  action.  If  the  modified 
result  is  4  through  7,  the  target  may  Disarm  the 
attacker (see Disarm). If the modified result is 8 or 
above,  the  attack  has  been  Parried  and  the  target 
may  execute  a  free  Melee  Attack  on their  attacker 
as well as a Disarm. This is called a Riposte. 

A  Riposte  cannot itself  be  Parried,  and  may  occur 
as  many  times  in  the  pulse  as  the  evading  target 
was Melee Attacked. An unarmed figure may Parry 
if they are ranked in Unarmed Combat. 

Defence 

A figure’s defence is subtracted from an attacker’s 
Strike Chance.  Defence  is  equal  to modified  Agil-
ity,  plus  defence  afforded  by  a  prepared  shield, 
defensive manoeuvres and magic. 

Defensive advantages due to terrain conditions and 
visibility  modifiers  are  covered  in  §57.1  Strike 
Chance Modifiers. A figure has no defence  except 
for  that  provided  by  magic  if  they  are  stunned  or 
incapacitated. 

A  prepared  shield  provides  defence  against  all 
Melee  and  Ranged  attacks  that  pass  through  a 
figure’s  front  hexes,  if  they  have  the  Shield  skill. 
At  Rank  0  and  each  additional  Rank,  the  defence 
bonus  (2%  to  6%,  see  §56.2  Shields)  is  added  to 
defence. No bonus is given for an unranked shield. 
A  figure  may  not  attack  with their  shield  or  count 
their  shield  as  a  prepared  weapon  for  Evading 

while  retaining  the  shield  defence  bonus.  A  pre-
pared  Main  Gauche  also  provides  some  defence; 
however  defence  is  only  applied  against  Melee 
attacks, and no defence is gained at Rank 0. 

Fumbles 

An  unmodified  Strike  Check  of  00  indicates  that 
the  attacker  has  fumbled;  they  lose  10  from  their 
Initiative Value until the end of the next pulse. This 
chance  of  fumbling  is  increased  if  the  weapon  is 
made  of  a  material  other  than  cold  iron,  as  listed 
below, unless it is magical, or a Bow or  Crossbow.

time of the weapon’s creation.

2% 

When  an  attacker  fumbles,  they  make  a  totally 
unmodified  D100  roll.  If  that  roll  is  under  their 
current  Initiative  Value,  they  suffer  no  further 
penalty for their slight fumble; if it not under their 
current  Initiative  Value,  apply  the  corresponding 
result from §52.3 or §52.4 (the Fumble tables). 

6.11 Damage 
A  successful  Strike  Check  usually  results  in  a 
Damage Check being performed. Each attack has a 
damage modifier that is applied to a D10 roll, and 
the result is the number of damage points inflicted 
by the attack (minimum damage 1). There are three 
types of physical damage possible from a success-
ful  strike,  depending  on  how  successful  the  Strike 
Check  was:  Fatigue  Damage,  Endurance  Damage, 
and Specific Grievous Injuries. 

Fatigue Damage 

Physical  Damage  affecting  Fatigue  may  be  ab-
sorbed by armour. Each type of armour has a Pro-
tection  Rating  (as  listed  in  §56.3  Armour  Chart), 
which  is  subtracted  from  the  Fatigue  damage  in-
flicted.  When  a  figure’s  Fatigue  reaches  0,  any 
subsequent attacks affecting Fatigue are subtracted 
from Endurance instead. A figure normally cannot 
lose  both  Fatigue  and  Endurance  from  one  Strike 
Check. 

Endurance Damage 

A  Strike  Check  of  15%  or  less  of  the  Modified 
Strike  Chance  results  in  damage  directly  affecting 
Endurance,  and  which  is  never  absorbed  by  ar-
mour. 

Specific Grievous Injuries 

In  addition  to  Endurance  damage,  a  Specific 
Grievous  Injury  may  occur  if  the  Strike  Check  is 
5%  or  less  of  the  Modified  Strike  Chance.  If  a 
potential  Specific  Grievous  Injury  occurs,  the 
attacker  rolls  D100  and  consults  the  Grievous 
Injury Table (§51). If the roll falls within the range 
specified for the weapon class, a Specific Grievous 
Injury has occurred, and the effects of the resulting 
injury are applied in combination with any Endur-
ance damage inflicted. 

A figure who suffers a Grievous Injury while wear-
ing  armour  has  the  Protection  Rating  of  their  ar-
mour  reduced  by  two  until  repaired.  Optionally,  a 
figure who is also carrying a shield may choose to 
have  the  shield  cloven  instead.  A  cloven  shield  is 
useless. 

Magical Damage 

All  magical  damage  affects  Fatigue  unless  other-
wise states in the spell description. Spell damage is 
assumed to be nonphysical, and thus unaffected by 
armour,  unless  the  spell  explicitly  states  that  it  is 
affected  by  armour.  Magical  damage  that  is  not 
affected  by  armour  never  stuns.  Breath  weapons 
are  treated  as  magical  damage,  but  are  Passively 
Resistible for half damage. 

Additional Damage 

The damage inflicted with a particular weapon may 
be  increased  due  to  exceptional  Physical  Strength 

or  Rank.  Only  one  of  these  two  modifiers  may  be 
applied at any time. 

If a figure chooses to over-strength a weapon, they 
may inflict an additional point of damage for every 
5  full  points  of  Physical  Strength  they  have  over 
the  minimum required to use  the  weapon.  Thrown 
or  Missile  weapons  may  not  be  over-strengthed. 
See §6.14 for Unarmed Combat. 

If  a  figure  chooses  to  apply  skill  to  inflict  extra 
damage,  they  may  inflict  an  additional  point  of 
damage for every full 4 

Ranks they have in the weapon. This affects Close, 
Melee Thrown, and Missile weapons. 

6.12 Effects of Damage 

Missile Lodgement 

When  a  figure  takes  effective  Endurance  Damage 
from  an  A-class  Missile  or  Thrown  weapon,  the 
weapon has lodged itself in their body, and reduces 
the figure’s Agility by 3 (5 if a pole weapon). The 
Agility loss for multi-hex creatures will be reduced 
in  proportion  to  their  size.  The  weapon  remains 
lodged until a Pass Action is taken to remove it. A 
barbed  arrow  lodges  if  it  inflicts  any  effective 
damage, and the figure will take D-4 Fatigue dam-
age  when the barbed arrow is  removed unless it is 
removed by a Healer. Barbed arrows have a Strike 
Chance penalty of -25. 

Stunning 

Whenever a figure suffers effective damage greater 
than  one-third  their  full  Endurance,  they  become 
stunned.  

• They stop performing any existing Action.  

•  They  have  no  Melee  Zone,  but  remain  Engaged 
as long as they are in the Melee  Zone of an oppo-
nent.  

• Their Initiative changes (see §6.3)  

•  They  have  no  defence  except  that  provided  by 
magic.  

•  Any  shield  or  weapon  (including  unarmed)  be-
comes unprepared.  

•  Their  only  Action  which  they  may  attempt  is 
recover from Stun.  

•  At  the  end  of  the  Pulse  in  which  they  were 
stunned,  a  figure  may  attempt  to  Recover  from 
Stun.  

• The Base Chance to recover from Stun in 2 × WP 
+ current Fatigue.  

•  They  may  not  move  on  the  Tactical  Display,  or 
change  facing.  They  may  still  perform  Free 
Acts(see §6.7). 

6 COMBAT 

Infection 

Whenever  a  figure  has  had  Physical  Damage  in-
flicted (or some particularly nasty form of magical 
attack),  they  may  have  become  Infected.  There  is 
normally  a  10%  chance  of  any  wound  becoming 
infected.  This  is  increased  by  (20  +  Endurance 
Damage)% if any Endurance damage was inflicted. 
Bite, claw and talon attacks, hostile environmental 
conditions and poor treatment may further increase 
the chance. See §4.7 for more information. 

6.13 Weapons 
Any  instrument  used  to  inflict damage  on  a  figure 
is  called  a  weapon.  Weapons  may  include  the 
figure’s hands, feet, teeth, etc. All normal weapons 
are  listed  on  the  Weapons  Chart  along  with  their 
characteristics.  The  only  limits  to  the  number  of 
weapons  a  character  may  have  in  their  possession 
are the weight and bulk of those weapons; the GM 
should  disallow  any  odd  or  unlikely  method  of 
carrying weapons. 

Normal Weapons 

The  Weapons  Chart  (§56.1)  lists  all  the  normal 
weapons and their characteristics. 

Weight  The  weight  of  the  weapon  in  pounds  (ex-
cluding scabbards, etc.). 

Physical  Strength  The  minimum  Physical 
Strength a figure needs to wield the weapon prop-
erly;  a  figure  without  the  required  PS  does  1  less 
point  of  damage  for  each  point  of  PS  they  are 
below  the  minimum.  A  figure  may  never  achieve 
Rank in a weapon they do not have the PS to wield. 

Manual  Dexterity  The  minimum  modified  Man-
ual  Dexterity  a  figure  needs  to  manipulate  the 
weapon properly; a figure without the required MD 
has  the  Base  Chance  of  the  weapon  lowered  by  5 
for  every  point  they  are  below  the  minimum.  A 
figure  may  never  achieve  Rank  in  a  weapon  they 
do not have the MD to manipulate. 

Range  The  distance  (in  hexes)  which  the  weapon 
may be Fired or Thrown. 

Class The type of damage done by the weapon - A-
class  for  thrusting  damage,  B-class  for  slashing 
damage,  and  C-class  for  crushing  damage.  This  is 
used for determining Specific Grievous Injuries. 

Use  The  range(s)  of  attack  the  weapon  may  be 
used at: R for ranged combat, M for Melee combat, 
C for Close combat. A weapon may not be used at 
an inappropriate range. 

Cost The standard cost (in Silver Pennies) to buy a 
typical example of the weapon. 

Maximum Rank The highest Rank attainable with 
the weapon. 

Massive Damage 

Unusual Weapons 

If  a  figure  with  positive  Fatigue  suffers  effective 
Fatigue  damage  greater  than  their  combined  full 
Fatigue  and  Endurance,  they  lose  all  their  Fatigue 
and  are  reduced  to  -1  Endurance.  If  they  suffer 
more  than  their  combined  full  Fatigue  and  1.5  × 
Endurance, they are dead. 

Unconsciousness 

When a figure’s Endurance reaches 3 or less, they 
must  make  a  (current  EN)  ×  WP  check  or  fall 
unconscious;  this  WP  check  is  repeated  every 
minute.  A  figure  on  0  Endurance  is  unconscious, 
but  stable.  A  figure  on  negative  Endurance  will 
lose  one  point  of  Fatigue  (Endurance  when  no 
Fatigue remains) until the bleeding is stanched by a 
Healer, or until dead. A creature with a full Endur-
ance  of  5  or  less  does  not  make  consciousness 
checks.  They  remain  conscious until they  fall  to  0 
or less Endurance. 

Death 

When  a  figure’s  Endurance  falls  below  negative 
one-half  their  full  Endurance,  the  figure  is  dead. 
Once dead, further damage may be inflicted, but no 
more  damage  will  be  inflicted  from  poison  or 
bleeding. 

A  figure  may  attempt  to  strike  bare-handed  (see 
Unarmed Combat), but only if one hand is free.  A 
figure  may  attempt  to  use  an  item  not  normally 
used  as  a  weapon  at  the  GM’s  discretion,  who 
assigns  Base  Chances,  damage  modifiers,  and  so 
forth.  Makeshift  weapons  will  generally  be  no 
better than a Crude Club. 

Envenomed Weapons 

If  the  GM  permits,  figures  may  carry  and  use  A-
class  \&  B-class  weapons  coated  with  poison.  At 
least  one  point  of  effective  damage  must  be  done 
for the poison to affect the target. 

When  anyone  except  an  Assassin  handles  an  en-
venomed  weapon  (§33.2),  they  must  make  a  3  × 
MD  check  every  time  they  handle  the  weapon. 
This  includes  coating  the  weapon,  preparing  or 
unpreparing the weapon, and attacking. An enven-
omed  weapon  will  usually  remain  effective  for  6 
hours or until at least one point of effective damage 
has been inflicted. 

6.14 Unarmed Combat 
Any  figure  may  attempt  to  attack  a  hostile  figure 
by  using  their  natural  weapons.  For  many  crea-
tures, this is the only way they may attack. Unless 

19 

6 COMBAT 

otherwise  specified,  all  figures  receive  one  Un-
armed  attack  per  pulse  without  penalty.  Some 
creatures may be able to attack more than once (see 
Bestiary). A figure may achieve Rank with natural 
weapons just as they may with any weapon. 

The  Base  Chance  for  a  humanoid  to  strike  with 
their  primary  hand  is  their  modified  Agility  ×  2 
plus Physical Strength over 15. The damage modi-
fier  is  -4  (+  1  for  every  3  full  points  of  Physical 
Strength over 15). 

Figures  with  Rank  3  or  more  Unarmed  may  kick 
rather than striking with their hands, enabling them 
to attack with their hands full. They may attempt to 
Trip  with  their  feet;  the  normal  Unarmed  Base 
Chance  and  damage  apply.  They  may  also  use  a 
kick  as  their  secondary  weapon  for  a  Multiple 
Strike Attack. 

6.15 Multi-hex Figures 
Many  figures  will  occupy  more  than  one  hex  on 
the  tactical  display.  Their  size  necessitates  altera-
tions in the resolution of movement and combat. 

Multi-hex  figures  have  three  types  of  hexes  sur-
rounding  them:  Front,  Rear  and  Flank.  The  exact 
configuration of Front, Rear and Flank hexes varies 
with  the  size  of  the  figure.  Front  and  Rear  hexes 
function in the same way for them as for any other 
figure.  Figures  in  Flank  hexes  gain  a  bonus  to 
strike  (see  §57.1),  and  are  not  in  the  Multi-hex 
figure’s  Melee  Zone,  but  do  not  gain  the  advan-
tages of a Rear attack. 

A multi-hex figure may move in any way so that its 
head enters any Front hex, and may move up to its 
full  TMR  in  this  fashion.  At  the  end  of  its  move, 
the figure must be unambiguously oriented towards 
one  hex  vertex.  A  reduction  of  1  hex  is  suggested 
for each 120◦ turn. 

A  multi-hex  figure  may  freely  pivot  or  move  into 
any  hex  occupied  by  a  1-hex  figure.  The  smaller 
figure  is  knocked  prone  automatically  and  the 
figure  may  then  attempt  to  trample  with  a  Base 
Chance of 40%, doing (D10 + size of the monster 
in  hexes)  damage.  Trampling  is  C-class  damage. 
Subsequent  attacks  on  the  prone  figure  use  the 
Trample Base Chance and damage in the Bestiary. 
A  multi-hex  figure  in  close  with  smaller  figures 
does not automatically fall prone. 

6.16 Mounted Combat 
In mounted combat, the TMR of the figure (mount 
and rider combined) is that of the mount; the rider 
may  not  move  at  all.  A  rider  and  mount  will  oc-
cupy  the  hexes  that  the  mount  would  normally 
occupy (as specified in the Bestiary). 

Controlling  a  mount  during  combat  is  dependent 
on  the  rider’s  Horsemanship  skill.  An  inexperi-
enced  horseman  will  have  an  incredibly  difficult 
time  even  controlling  their  mount  in  a  chaotic 
melee; it would be better for them to dismount and 
fight on foot. 

Action Restrictions 

Almost  any  action  the  figure  is  capable  of  while 
standing  on  the  ground  may  be  performed  while 

mounted.  They  may  not  (1)  use  a  two-handed 
weapon,  (2)  fire  a  missile  weapon  or  throw  a 
weapon  while  moving,  (3)  use  more  than  one 
weapon  at  a  time.  These  restrictions  are  lifted 
depending on the Horsemanship Rank on the Rider 
(see  §29.2  Horsemanship).  A  figure  may  always 
use  a  shield  and  a  one-handed  weapon  while 
mounted. 

On  a  normal  mount,  the  rider  will  not  be  able  to 
attack figures directly in front of them except with 
a  spear  (or  similar  long  hafted  weapon)  or  any 
Ranged  weapon.  A  mounted  figure  may  not  at-
tempt a Shield Bash (except against other mounted 
figures).  However,  they  may  attempt  a  Mounted 
Charge.  A  rider  may  freely  mount  or  dismount 
when  the  mount  is  stationary,  by  taking  a  Pass 
Action; the difficulty of dismounting when moving 
is determined by the GM. 

Charge 

A Charge on a mount is executed in the same man-
ner  as  a  Charge  on  foot  except  the  amount  of 
movement  prior  to  the  attack  may  be  greater  and 
the  Charge  must  be  in  a  straight  line  (no  facing 
changes allowed). 

In  addition  to  the  normal  charging  options,  an 
unengaged mounted figure may attempt a Mounted 
Charge.  This  requires  the  mount  to  move  at  least 
1/2  TMR  without  changing  facing.  At  the  end  of 
the  figure’s  movement,  they  may  make  a  Melee 
Attack  with  a  +20  bonus  to  Strike  Chance.  If  the 
figure overstrengths the weapon, the Mount’s TMR 
may  be  added  to  the  rider’s  Physical  Strength.  If 
using a Lance, the Mount’s Physical Strength may 
be used for the purposes of over-strengthing (§6.11 
Additional Damage). 

Any  act  of  turning  the  mount  or  stopping  it  after 
the Charge will require a Horsemanship Check (see 
§29.2).  The  pulse  following  any  mounted  Charge, 
the  momentum will  take  the  mount past  the  target 
to  its  full  TMR.  Any  attempt  to  turn  or  stop  the 
mount  will  occur  after  that  movement  is  termi-
nated. A failed check will result in the mount con-
tinuing on its way. 

6.17 Aerial Combat 
Whenever  an  avian  (or  any  other  flying  entity)  is 
airborne, the figure’s height above the ground may 
have to be noted. 

Combat Ranges 

Hostile  figures  are  regarded  as  being  in  adjacent 
hexes  if  the  Range  between  them  is  less  than  10 
feet. Hostile figures are in Close Combat if they are 
in the same hex and the height difference is 3 feet 
or  less.  For  Ranged  \&  Magical  Combat, the  range 
of  weapons  \&  spells  may  be  calculated  using  the 
following formula: 

A2 + B2 = C2 (Pythagorean) where A is the horizon-
tal  distance  between  the  two  characters,  B  is  the 
difference  in  their  altitude,  and  C  is  the  range  be-
tween the figures. 

Close Combat 

An  airborne  figure  will  be  pulled  from the  air and 
become  prone  if  their  combined  PS  +  AG  is  less 
than  that  of  their  ground-based  opponent.  Other-
wise  the  airborne  figure  will  remain in  flight.  The 
ground-based figure may be lifted from the ground 
if  the  airborne  figure  has  sufficient  Physical 
Strength and leverage. 

An  airborne  figure  may  benefit  from  making  a 
charge attack by diving on the target. 

Casting 

If  an  Adept  is  flying  and  the  Adept  is  in  all  other 
ways eligible to cast a spell (has their hands free, is 
not  out  of  Fatigue,  etc.)  they  may  move  up  to  1/2 
(rounded  down)  of  their  TMR  and  attempt  to  cast 
the  spell  prior  to,  during  or  after  their  movement. 
This  also  applies  to  all  flying  magic-using  mon-
sters and Adepts with flying mounts. 

6.18 Aquatic Combat 
Aquatic Combat may take place between figures at 
different depths. Refer to the aerial combat section 
for guidelines. 

Defence  

•  Defence  caused  by  natural  agility  is  halved  for 
non-aquatics.  

• Non-magical defence is always halved.  

• Magical defences are unaffected. 

Weapons 

If  the  character  is  on  a  solid  surface  then  the 
following applies:  

• A class weapons are unaffected  

• B \& C class weapons have their non-magical base 
chances and damage halved. 

If the character is floating:  

•  A  class  weapons  have  their  non-magical  base 
chances  and  damage  halved.  Exceptions  are  tri-
dents, javelins, spears.  

• B \& C class weapons cannot be used. Exceptions 
are nets and garottes. 

Magical bonuses are unaffected. 

Close  combat  is  unaffected  but  the  GM  can  rule 
that certain actions are impossible. 

Bows  and  crossbows  must  be  waterproofed.  The 
effective  range  of  a  thrown  or  missile  weapon  is 
divided by 10. 

No shield rushes are possible with a standard shield 
because of water resistance. 

Evading defence bonuses are 10% + 2% / Rank for 
prepared 

B  \&  C  class  weapons.  A  class  weapons  are  unaf-
fected. 

6.19 Magical Combat
