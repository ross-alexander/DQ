\begin{Chapter}{College Magic}

\section{Introduction}

This  section  includes  those  spells  and  rituals  that 
are common to all Colleges. These spells and ritu-
als  are  still  specific  to  a  College  so  an  Adept  can 
only  learn  them  from  another  Adept  of  the  same 
College. 

\section{Counterspells}

Counterspells act to increase Magic Resistance and 
defeat  the  workings  of  other  magic.  Each  college 
has  two  of  these  spells:  a  General  Knowledge 
Counterspell,  and  a  Special  Knowledge  Counter-
spell.  These  are  specific  to  the  college  —  a  Fire 
College  Special  Counterspell  will  not  affect  the 
workings  of  any  Earth  College  spell,  nor  would  it 
affect  a  General  Knowledge  spell  of  the  Fire  Col-
lege. Adepts learn both Counterspells of their own 
college as part of their General Knowledge. 

Counterspell 

Range: 25 feet + 25 / Rank 
Duration: (D10 + 5) minutes +1 / Rank 
Experience Multiple: 
100 – General Knowledge Counterspell 

200 – Special Knowledge Counterspell 

Base Chance: 40% 
Resist: Passive 
Storage: Investment, Ward, Potion, Magical Trap 
Target: Entity, Object, Area 
Effects: There are several distinct uses for a Coun-
terspell. They are: 

1. If cast upon an entity or object the target adds 30 
(+ 3 / Rank) to their Magic Resistance when resist-
ing  the  type  of  magic  to  which  the  Counterspell 
applies. 

2.  If  cast  upon  an  area  the  Counterspell  affects  a 
space  15  feet  in  diameter.  All  targets  within  the 
area gain the magic resistance bonus detailed in #1 
above and additionally no one within the area may 
cast a spell of the type affected. A double or triple 
effect cast may increase the area of effect to 25 feet 
or 35 feet respectively. 

3.  If  a  Counterspell  of  the  appropriate  type  is  cast 
over an area under the effects of a Ward, then that 
part of the warded area is temporarily deactivated. 
When  the  duration  of  the  Counterspell  ends,  the 
Ward will become active again. 

4. An Adept may use a Counterspell to dissipate a 
spell  that  they  have  cast.  They  must  direct  the 
Counterspell  at  the  specific  spell  effect  that  they 
wish to remove.  In the case of area  effect spells it 
is  sufficient  to  cast  one  Counterspell  within  the 
area  —  the  entire  area  need  not  be  covered.  One 
Counterspell will dissipate one spell. 

5.  Some  spells  may  be  removed  by  any  Adept 
casting the appropriate Counterspell  at them. Only 
spells  that  specifically  state  that  they  may  be  re-
moved this way can be affected. One Counterspell 
will  dissipate  one  spell.  The  Adept  must  specify 
the name of the spell to  be removed at the time of 
casting. 

A target may only be under the effects of the Coun-
terspells  of  a  single  College.  The  target  may  also 
occupy  an  area  under  the  effects  of  another  Col-
lege’s  Counterspells.  Thus  the  maximum  number 
of  Counterspells  that  an  entity  or  object  may  gain 
benefit from is four: the General and Special Coun-
terspells  of  one  college  cast  upon  them,  and  the 
General  and  Special  Counterspell  of  another  col-
lege  upon  the  area  they  occupy.  Counterspells  of 
other colleges cast upon them will obey the normal 
rules  for  queuing.  A  target  may  only  benefit  from 
one Counterspell against a particular spell. If there 
is more than one appropriate Counterspell protect-
ing  a  target  the  highest  ranked  one  will  have  an 
effect. 

Characters  may  learn  Counterspells  from  colleges 
other  than  their  own,  in  which  case  they  are  con-

sidered  Special  Knowledge  spells.  The  Counter-
spells of other colleges are practised at Rank 0 and 
may not be ranked. 

10.3 General Knowledge Rituals 

Ritual Spell Preparation 

For  each  hour  spent  in  preparation,  the  Base 
Chance of a spell is increased by 3 (up to a maxi-
mum  of  30  if  10  full  hours  are  spent  in  prepara-
tion).  If,  at  any  time  during  the  preparation,  the 
Adept’s concentration is broken, the entire process 
must  be  restarted  from  scratch  or  abandoned  and 
any time previously spent in preparation is lost. An 
Adept’s  concentration  is  always  broken  if  combat 
occurs during the ritual. The Adept may engage in 
no  other  activity  while  preparing  the  spell.  The 
spell  must  be  cast  immediately  upon  completing 
the  Ritual  Preparation.  The  Spell  Preparation  Rit-
ual  is  a  General  Knowledge  Ritual.  An  Adept 
cannot achieve Rank with this Ritual. 

Purification 

Duration: 4 hours + 4 / Rank 
Experience Multiple: 200 
Base Chance: MA + WP + 3% / Rank 
Cast Time: 1 hour 
Effects: This purification ritual takes one hour and 
confers the following benefits:  

• 0 (+ 1 / 5 full Ranks) MA.  

• 0 (+ 1 / Rank) Magic Resistance. 

The additional MA does not count towards any EP 
reduction  (e.g.  ranking  general  spells  or  rituals). 
This ritual cannot backfire. 

10.4 Special Knowledge Rituals 

The Ward Ritual 

Duration: Until triggered 
Experience Multiple: 400 
Base Chance: MA + 3% / Rank 
Resist: None 
Target: Volume 
Cast Time: 1 hour 
Material: None 
Actions: Concentration 
Concentration Check: Standard 
Effects: An entity may employ Ritual Magic to set 
a Ward over an area which they occupy. 

A Ward is a spell which is activated by the entry or 
exit  of  objects  or  entities  into  the  volume  it  occu-
pies.  Whenever  an  entity  wants  to  create  a  Ward, 
they engage in one or more hours of Ritual Prepa-
ration to create the Ward. At the end of the prepa-
ration, they check to see if the Ward is set by mak-
ing  a Cast Check.  If  the  Cast  Check is  successful, 
the Ward  is  set.  If  the  Check is  not successful,  no 
Ward exists. 

It is possible to backfire from an attempt to create a 
Ward.  In  such  cases,  the  spell  being  incorporated 
into the Ward backfires immediately. This is rolled 
for  on  the  backfire  table  as  though  a  normal  Cast 
Check had resulted in the backfire. 

Once  the  Ward  is  cast,  the  entry  or  exit  of  any 
object  or  entity  in  the  area  occupied  by  the  Ward 
(determined by  the  range  of  the  spell  incorporated 
into the Ward) may trigger the Ward. The area that 
the Ward occupies and the range of the spell incor-
porated  into  the  Ward  are  identical.  This  means 
that  most  spells  (Range  15’  +  15  rank)  have  a 
minimum sized ward of 

30’  diameter  (a  sphere,  centred  on  the  caster,  of 
15’radius).  Also,  note  that  many  spells  have  an 
indefinite  range  and  hence  cannot  be  incorporated 
into  a  Ward.  This  includes  spells  with  ranges  of 
unlimited,  self,  or  touch  and  spells  that  can  only 
affect the Adept. Once a Ward has been triggered, 
it ceases to exist. It takes full effect on the entity(s) 
or object(s) that triggered it, but is dissipated there-
after. It takes full but normal effect on the target(s) 
– there is no possibility for a double or triple effect 

28 

(nor  for  failure  or  backfire).  Note  that  a  Ward  set 
up  for  triggering  by  an  entity  or  object  exiting the 
area  cannot  be  a  targeted  spell,  since  the  target 
would  no  longer  be  within  range.  The  exiting 
method of triggering is still useful for area of effect 
spells  that  don’t  have  a  specific  target.  All  Wards 
emanate from the  exact spot occupied by the indi-
vidual who cast the Ward (important for determin-
ing  range).  Note  that  there  are  a  couple  of  spells 
that can have an effect beyond their range. 

Spells that are not suitable for incorporation into a 
Ward  are  those  which  require  concentration,  or 
some  other  action  by  the  Adept.  A  Ward  always 
consists  of  only  one  spell.  More  than  one  Ward 
may not be set over a specific area. Any attempt to 
set  a  Ward  on  an  area  that  overlaps  another  Ward 
will fail. The Adept will only become aware of this 
if they would otherwise have been successful. 

Whenever  creating  a  Ward,  the  Adept  must  also 
specify  under  what  conditions  the  Ward  will  be 
triggered.  They  may  decide  not  to  limit  its  effect, 
in which case the Ward will be triggered by anyone 
or anything entering the area over which it is set, or 
they may limit it to affecting specific individuals or 
anything  in  between.  Thus,  an  Adept  could  set  a 
Ward that would only be triggered by the entry or 
exit  of  a  troll.  If  a  multi-target  spell  is  required  to 
hit  more  than  one  target  from  a  Ward,  then  the 
trigger  must  include  the  number  of  beings.  For 
example,  a  spell  which  affects  three  targets  could 
be set up to be triggered by three trolls. The instant 
that  the  third  troll  entered  the  volume  the  Ward 
would be triggered, but prior to that any number of 
lone  trolls  could  have  freely  moved  through  the 
Ward. 

A Ward, once it is successfully set, cannot be trig-
gered  until  the  caster  leaves  the  volume  of  the 
Ward.  Specifics  of  the  triggering  mechanism must 
be something intrinsic to the object or entity (simi-
lar to Detect Aura). Hence a Ward could be set up 
to be triggered by a Rank 4 or higher assassin, but 
could not be  constructed to  trigger  on  the  assassin 
known  as  Mac  the  Knife.  In  order  to  affect,  or 
exclude,  specific  entities,  those  entity’s  Individual 
True Names may be incorporated into the Ward, or 
a  sufficiently  detailed  description  so  as  to  identify 
the individual. If Individual True Names are incor-
porated then there is no possible way to determine 
what  those  names  are,  but  a  Divination  would 
reveal  the  number  of  entities  specifically  affected, 
or  excluded.  A  Ward  cannot  recognise  a  specific 
object,  but  merely  an  instance  of  an  object.  For 
example, “my sword” could not be included in the 
triggering mechanism, but a “magical sword with a 
yak-hide  grip”  could  be.  A  Ward  cannot  tell  the 
time  so  a  Ward  cannot  include  such  phrases  as 
“after  ×  minutes”  or  “at  midnight”.  Nor  does  a 
Ward have any memory, so in cannot be set up to 
be triggered by the third troll to pass. 

Once  a  Ward  is  set,  any  entity  or  object  which 
could  trigger  the  Ward  and  which  enters  the  area 
occupied  by  the  Ward  is  automatically  subject  to 
whatever  spell  was  woven  into  the  Ward.  Only 
those spells known by the caster of the Ward may 
be  woven  into  the  Ward  and  they  take  effect  ex-
actly as if the caster of the Ward were present and 
casting  at  the  spot  occupied  by  the  entity  when 
they  set  the  Ward.  All  entities  or  objects  nearby 
which would normally be affected by the spell are 
subject  to  its  effects  when  it  is  cast  as  a  result  of 
the Ward  being  triggered.  Note  that for  entities  or 
objects to be affected they must be within the vol-
ume that the Ward occupied, with the exception of 
those  spells  which  can  affect  beyond  their  range. 
Targeted  spells  can  only  affect  what  is  incorpo-
rated in the triggering mechanism. 

Wards are dispelled in one of two ways: either by a 
Namer  casting  the  appropriate  Counterspell  of  the 
same  College  incorporated  into  the  Ward,  or  by 
being  triggered  by  an  entity  or  object.  The  Adept 

10 COLLEGE MAGIC 

who  set  the  Ward  may  always  counterspell  their 
own spells, and hence they can dissipate their own 
wards by casting a counterspell into it. Wards exist 
in perpetuity until dispelled. 

The Investment Ritual (Ver 1.2) 

Experience Multiple: 300 
Base Chance: MA + 3% / Rank 
Target: Object 
Cast Time: Special 
Effects: This ritual allows an Adept to store a spell 
that they know in an object or scroll. 

Creation  of  Invested  Items  The  object  to  be  in-
vested  will  often  be  in  a  form  appropriate  to  the 
spell  that  it  is  to  contain  (e.g.  Spell  of  Opening 
invested  into  a  set  of  lock  picks,  or  Spell  of  En-
chanting  Armour  into  a  set  of  armour),  and  of  a 
size appropriate to the rank and style of that spell. 
Note that a staff engraved with the symbols  of the 
Adept’s  college  is  always  considered  to  be  appro-
priate. The item must weigh at least one ounce. 

An Investment Ritual may not be performed on an 
object which still carries charges of invested spells, 
or  a  shaped  item,  or  anything  made  of  cold  iron. 
The  Adept  may  invest  any  spell  that they  know  at 
any  rank  up  to  their  rank  in  the  spell.  The  time 
taken to perform the ritual is (Rank of Spell - Rank 
of  Investment  Ritual)  days  per  item,  minimum  1 
day.  In  this  time  the  Adept  may  invest  up  to 
Rank/2  (minimum  1)  charges,  or  they  may  de-
crease  the  charges  and  save  1  day  per  reduced 
charge (minimum of 1 day still applies). They may 

never  store  more  than  Rank/2  charges  in  an  in-
vested item. 

are applied at the moment of triggering, not invest-
ing. 

As a ritual which takes an extended period of time, 
the rules in §7.2 apply. The cost of  materials used 
in  creating  an  invested  item  is  [spell  Rank  (mini-
mum  1)  ×  charges  ×  EM  of  spell  /  2]  silver  pen-
nies. These ingredients are consumed progressively 
during  the  ritual,  with  the  last  snatch  of  incense 
being  burned  as  the  success  (or  otherwise)  of  the 
investment is determined. 

The  Adept may elect to spend more than this base 
cost  to  increase  the  chance  of  the  success  of  the 
ritual  of  investment.  For  every  200  extra  silver 
pennies  spent  on  materials  the  base  chance  of 
success with this ritual is increased by 1%. 

If  the  Investment  ritual  backfires,  then  it  is  as 
though the spell being invested has backfired. 

Creation  of  Invested  Scrolls  The  Adept  may 
instead  opt  to  prepare  a  scroll  (in  a  language  in 
which  they  have  a  minimum  of  Rank  8  literacy). 
This  takes  one  day  per  scroll,  and  costs  only  half 
the  usual  sum  to  create.  A  scroll  may  only  ever 
hold  one  charge,  and  weighs  only  two  ounces  — 
however  a  scroll  case  sufficient  to  protect  it  from 
the elements will weigh much more. 

Triggering  The  Base  Chance  to  successfully  trig-
ger an invested spell is the cast chance of the spell 
at the  moment the  adept  completes  the  investment 
ritual,  including  all  college  bonuses,  MA,  magic, 
and  environmental  conditions.  Dice  roll  modifiers 

The  effects  of  a  triggered  spell  are  as  if  the  caster 
were standing there casting the spell; the triggering 
entity is not considered the caster. 

A  spell  contained in  an  invested  item functions  as 
any pulse cast spell, with the usual chance of dou-
ble and treble effect, and of backfire. Any sentient 
entity  may  trigger  an  invested  item,  if  it  is  physi-
cally  possible  for  them  to  do  so,  and  if  they  have 
been taught how to trigger it. The  Adept who cre-
ated the item, and any Adept who has divinated it, 
know  how  to  trigger  it.  Teaching  someone  how  to 
trigger an item takes 15 minutes. 

Triggering  always  involves  speech  or  a  specific 
motion to target the item, which may be perceived 
by  a  sufficiently  alert  observer.  An  invested  item 
always takes a full five seconds to trigger. 

Triggering  a  prepared  scroll  takes  a  full  ten  sec-
onds and may only be done by someone literate in 
the  language  in  which  the  scroll  is  written.  The 
scroll  must be  read aloud  without interruption.  No 
teaching is required to trigger a scroll. 

Any  item  or  scroll  loses  a  charge  when  it  is  trig-
gered regardless of whether or not the triggering is 
successful. 

Limitations  A  Namer  casting  the  appropriate 
counterspell  may  drain  an  invested  item  of  all 
magic; refer to Namer T-2 (§17.3) for details.
