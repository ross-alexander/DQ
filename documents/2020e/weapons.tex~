56.1 Weapons 

Special Notes for Weapons 

 

Weapons  are  normally  wielded  one-handed,  and 
the  exceptions are  noted  with  a  (2)  after  the  name 
of  the  weapon.  Some  may  be  used  either  one  or 
two-handed,  and  these  are  noted  with  a  (1–2). 
When  weapons  of  this  type  are  wielded  two 
handed, increase their Damage Modifier by 1. 

- indicates that a weapon has no Class for purposes 
of  Grievous  Injuries;  when  a  possible  Grievous 
Injury  is  rolled,  only  damage  affecting  Endurance 
results. 

V indicates that the characteristic is variable. 

A  When  attacking  a  foe  whose  modified  AG  is 
between  12  and  9  (inclusive)  the  weapon  may  be 
used to attack twice in one pulse without penalty; if 
the  modified  AG  is  8  or  less,  the  weapon  may 
attack three times in a pulse. 

B Only giants can use giant weapons. 

C  A  torch  is  not  actually  a  weapon,  but  may  be 
used  as  such  in  emergencies.  Also,  brandishing  a 
burning torch in the face of an animal may cause it 
to flee. Any animal whose WP is 10 or less may be 
scared off if it fails a roll of 4 × WP. A successful 
roll indicates the animal is not impressed. No Rank 
may ever be achieved with a torch. 

D  The  sap  may  only  be  used  to  knock  out  targets 
wearing only leather, cloth or no armour. Used by 
an assassin, any hit knocks out the target; for any-
one  else,  any  hit  stuns  and  4  or  more  points  of 
effective  damage  knocks  out  the  target.  This  will 
not work on targets larger than human size. 

E  The  following  weapons  also  function  as  thrown 
weapons:  dagger,  hand  axe,  battle  axe,  giant  axe, 
crude  club,  war  club,  giant  club,  mace,  war  ham-
mer, javelin, spear, giant spear, net, bola and rock. 

F Up to three throwing darts may be thrown at one, 
two, or three targets in one action with no penalty. 

G A boomerang returns to the thrower if it does not 
hit anything during its flight. 

H  A  grenado  is  filled  with  any  substance  (manu-
factured  by  an  alchemist)  designed  to  burst  into 
flames  on  impact.  These  substances  include  greek 
fire, methane, and anything else the GM will allow. 
It  bursts  on  landing  (it  need  not  be  thrown  at  a 
particular figure), and its effects are determined by 
the substance contained within. If a “miss” is rolled 
for  the  strike  check,  the  GM  should  randomly 
determine  whether  the  grenado  landed  short,  long, 
left,  or  right  of  the  target  (or  any  combination 
thereof).

56 WEAPON, SHIELDS & ARMOUR CHARTS 

I A javelin functions as a thrown weapon unless it 
is  launched  by  a  spear  thrower,  in  which  case  the 
spear  thrower’s  characteristics  are  used  and  it 
functions as a missile weapon. 

J  A  pike  may  be  used  to  melee  attack  any  figure 
within two hexes; its melee zone extends into what 
would  normally  be  the  first  hexes  of  the  figure’s 
ranged zone. 

K A lance may be used only by a mounted figure. 

L  All  missile  weapons  must  be  loaded  before  fir-
ing;  this  action  is  in  addition  to  preparing  the 
weapon itself. A pass action must be taken in order 
to load the sling, any draw bow, the spear thrower, 
and  the  blowgun.  Two  consecutive  pass  actions 
must be taken to load a crossbow (three if using a 
cranequin). 

M Longbows may not be used while mounted, nor 
by small figures, including Dwarves & Halflings. 

N An entangling weapon may be used as a garotte 
in Close Combat. 

O The whip may be used to entangle and do dam-
age  in  the  same  pulse  to  the  same  target  in  melee 
combat.  In  close  combat,  it  functions  as  a  garotte. 
Once  the  target  is  entangled,  the  attacker  may 
choose  to  leave  them entangled  (thus  letting  go  of 
the whip), or disentangle the target themselves, and 
retain possession of the weapon. 

P  Cesti  are  worn  on  the  hands  and  need  not  be 
prepared in order to be used. 

Q  The  garotte  is  used  to  strangle  the  target  and 
may  only  be  used  against  human-sized  or  smaller 
victims.  When  used  by  a  trained  assassin,  once  a 
successful  hit  has  been  scored,  it  will  continue  to 
do  damage  every  pulse  from  then  on  until  the 
victim  is  dead  or  the  assassin  has  taken  effective 
damage from either the victim or an outside source. 
If the victim’s PS is greater than the assassin’s the 
GM may permit them to attempt to break the hold, 
similar  to  the  attempt  to  restrain.  If  the  attempt  is 
successful, the hold is broken and the assassin will 
have  to  make  another  successful  strike  check  to 
continue  the  strangulation.  Some  types  of  plate 
armour  may,  at  the  GM’s  discretion,  prevent  the 
successful  use  of  this  weapon  due  to  protection 
around  the  neck  area.  A  non-assassin  has  to  roll  a 
strike  check  every  pulse  to  see  if  any  damage  can 
be done. 

R Unarmed has a base chance of 2 × AG + PS over 
15. The damage modifier is -4 (+ 1 for every 3 full 
points of PS over 15). 

S  All  shot,  darts,  arrows,  and  quarrels  come  in 
appropriate  pouches  or  quivers  of  20;  the  weight 
and  cost  of  the  pouch  or  quiver  is  not  included  in 
the information given for the accessory. 

T  A  cranequin  is  used  to  cock  crossbows;  it  re-
quires a PS of 11 and two free hands. 

U If a blowgun dart does any effective damage, the 
damage is not scored against their victim but rather 
they suffer the effects of the substance which coats 
the tip (poison, for instance; see Alchemist §30).

Weight The weight of the shield in pounds. 
 
Defence  /  Rank  The  percentage  by  which  the 
 
figure’s defence is increased per Rank while the 
shield  is  prepared  (Rank  0  is  counted  as  a 
 
Rank†). 
 
Manual  Dexterity  Loss  The  number  of  points 
 
the  figure’s  MD  is  reduced  by  for  all  purposes 
 
while that shield is prepared. 

 
Cost  The  cost  in  Silver  Pennies  for  a  shield  of 
average workmanship. 
 

When  a  shield  is  not  prepared,  it  is  considered 
slung  on  the  back  of  the  figure  carrying  it.  All 
shields except the tower shield and main gauche 
are  constructed  of  wood  and  hides  and  do  not 
affect the flow of mana in regard to Adepts. 

†The  main  gauche  does  not  subtract  its  defence 
from  any  fire  attack,  and  cannot  make  a  shield 
rush attack. The main gauche functions both as a 
weapon  and  a  shield,  and  only  one  EP  expendi-
ture  is  used  to  rise  in  Rank  in  both.  No  defence 
bonus is gained at Rank 0.

‡As per Dragon - 3 

 
Weight  The  number  by  which  a  figure’s  size  is 
 
multiplied  to  find  the  weight  of  the  armour  in 
pounds. Size number for the character races are: 
 
Halfling (3), Dwarf (4), Elf (5), Orc (6), Human 
(6), Hill Giant (9). For all others, the multiple is 
their  height  in  feet  (round  up).  Females  should 
subtract 0.5 from the multiples. 

 

Protection  The  number  of  Damage  Points  the 
armour absorbs. 

Agility  Loss  The  number  of  points  the  figure’s 
AG is reduced for all purposes when the armour 
is worn. Does not include possible additional AG 
loss for the weight of the armour. 

Cost  The  cost  in  Silver  Pennies  for  the  armour. 
Costs  assumes  average  workmanship  and  man-
sized  armour;  larger  or  smaller  armour  should 
cost proportionally more or less. 

Stealth  Adjustment  The  amount  by  which  a 
figure  wearing  that  type  of  armour  has  their 
stealth percentage adjusted. 

Note  Cloth  armour  is  worn  underneath  all  other 
armours  and  its  protection  and  weight  are  fac-
tored into those armours. 

1.  Silvered  Armour  has  the  same  protection  – 
cost  is  +  30,000  sp.  Permits  magic  at  -10%  to 
Base Chance. 

2.  Truesilvered  Armour  has  the  same  protection 
– cost is + 180,000 sp. Permits magic at no modi-
fication to Base Chance. 

3. Bronze  Armour  has 2 points  less  protection – 
cost  is  the  same.  Permits  magic  at  no  modifica-
tion to Base Chance.
