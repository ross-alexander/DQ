\begin{Skill}[3.0]{warrior}{Warrior}

Warriors train in advanced combat and weapon techniques, and practice
the art of melee combat until it becomes a series of finely honed
instincts.  They practise on all terrains with all types of weapons
against different configurations and tactics, so that they may always
respond optimally without the need for thought.

Warriors usually join and train within one Warrior Guild (or school),
most guilds are exclusive and will not train those of other guilds,
many have strong ethical codes such as Chivalry and training is often
only available after indoctrination in the code.

\section{Restrictions}

A Warrior may never train in the Warrior skill without a training
partner of at least equal Warrior rank.

Assassin teaches a method of fighting that does not stack with
Warrior.  The benefits of Warrior OR Assassin (not both) may be
applied to any specific attack or defence.

A Warrior must have at least 3 weapons at rank 4 or higher including 1
melee rated weapon and 1 close rated weapon.

A Warrior requires various minimum weapons skills per Rank.  Before
being able to achieve any new Rank in the warrior skill, a Warrior
must achieve the Ranks summarised in table 49.5 below.

\section{Benefits}

A Warrior gains a bonus to defence in melee and close combat of 2\%
(+2\% per rank).

When using ranked melee or close rated weapons, or weapons from a
category where they have a higher ranked weapon, a Warrior:

\begin{Itemize}
\item Gains +1 Engaged IV per rank (no benefit at rank 0).
\item Gains +2\% (+2\% per rank) to Strike Chance.
\item Gains +1 damage at ranks 5 \& 10.
\item Gains +1 effective weapon rank for the Parry Calculation at ranks 4 \& 8. 
\end{Itemize}

For categories where the Warrior has a ranked weapon, they:

\begin{Itemize}

\item may use any weapon from the category at half the Rank of their
  maximum Ranked weapon in that category or at half their warrior
  Rank, whichever is lower.

\item may Rank weapons in the category without a tutor for an
  additional 10\% EP cost.

\item is treated as a merchant of their warrior Rank when attempting
  to buy or value non-magical weapons, with which they have ranks.  If
  they have a passing familiarity with the weapon (i.e.  has Ranks in
  the same category but not the actual weapon) they will act as a
  merchant of half their warrior Rank.

\end{Itemize}

A Rank 5 Warrior may start to acquire Warrior Special Abilities.

While some abilities are general combat abilities and only need to be
learned once, most are weapon specific and must be learned once per
weapon.  A warrior gains one special ability at ranks 5, 6, \& 7, two
at ranks 8, 9, \& 10.

Additional special abilities may be gained without increasing in rank
by the expenditure of 10,000 Experience Points and 8 weeks of training
per ability.  These costs are discounted by 25\% if the warrior has
reached rank 8, or by 50\% if they have reached rank 10.

  position as a free action.

\item[Solid Strike (Weapon)] Costs 1 FT per damage D10 rolled, must be
