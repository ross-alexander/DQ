\begin{Chapter}{The College of Air Magics (Ver 2.1)}

The College of Air Magics is concerned with the environment of air and
the weather.  It should be noted that there used to be a third aspect
to this college, but the Ice Mages’ increasing interest in ice and
cold (rather than air) was considered totally unacceptable and they
were expelled (to form the independent College of Ice Magics).

When trying to ascertain the effect of spells which change the
weather, especially wind, please read the notes accompanying the
Weather Table.  An area may be affected by more than one Air College
spell or ritual at the same time providing that each change affects a
different aspect of the weather.

\subsubsection{Traditional Colours}

Air Mages traditionally dress in blues and greys.  Due to their habit
of being outdoors in all weathers, Adepts of this college tend to wear
practical clothing and avoid long trailing cloaks or skirts.

\subsubsection{Traditional Symbols}

Given the ephemeral nature of their element, Air Mages have little use
for symbols, usually allowing their traditional colours to advertise
their profession.

\section{Glossary}

Totally Enclosed is defined as being surrounded by walls or earth in a
windowless area of less than 100 feet in any dimension where there is
no direct and immediate communication with the air outside.

Partially Enclosed is defined as being in a cave or building or
similar walled or earth enclosed area of greater than 100 feet in its
smallest dimension, or in a smaller area, but having means of direct
con- tact with the air outside, such as through an open window or
portal.

On top of a Mountain is defined as being within ten 
minutes  walking  distance  of  the  peak.  Mountains 
have an enormous impact on the weather patterns. 

\section{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Air Magics may only practise their arts if
they are in contact with the air.  They may never practise Air magics
while underwater or in a vacuum.  They may never summon avians into
an environment where they could not survive.

The MA requirement for this college is 13. 

\section{Base Chance Modifiers}

The following modifiers are added to the Base Chance of performing any
talent, spell or ritual of the College of Air Magics. Only one
modifier may be applied:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={Xr}}
Caster is underground or totally enclosed 		& -15 \\
Caster is only partially enclosed 			& -5 \\
Caster is flying, or otherwise not in contact with any liquid or solid surface & +5 \\
Caster is standing in natural winds of 40 mph or greater & +10 \\
Caster is more than 100’ above ground (flying or falling etc.) & +10 \\
Caster is above all landmarks within 10 miles and at least 500’ above the ground (flying or falling etc.) & +20 \\
Caster is on top of a mountain & +20 \\
\end{dqtblr}

\section{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Aerial Affinity}
\multiple{75}
\begin{effects}
Due to their close association with the environment of air, Air Mages
have the following abilities:
\begin{Enumerate}
\item The Adept can modify any flying or landing rolls by 1 step
  better per 5 full ranks.

\begin{example}
The Air Mage comes in for a landing and the GM tells the player that
they need to make a 3 × AG landing roll, but because the Air Mage has
this talent at rank 12 they need only make a 5 × AG landing roll.
\end{example}

\item They will not suffer from the effects of high altitude.  This
  talent only works up to a height of 2,000 feet per rank.

\begin{example} 
Hypothermia (at high altitudes), flying sickness, altitude sickness.
\end{example}

\item General knowledge relating to being airborne. 
\begin{example}
Safe velocities, altitude, down drafts, flight hazards.
\end{example}

\item Due to their close association with the environment, the Adept
  can modify the Force downwards and Gauge upwards on the Weather
  Scale Table by 1 per 4 ranks, for themselves.
\end{Enumerate}
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Detect Fumes}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may detect the presence of fumes and vapours and has a
chance equal to the Adept’s modified perception (+ 3 / Rank) of
accurately identifying each smell present.  The Adept must spend a
pulse sniffing the air while applying this talent.  If the Adept’s
sense of smell is not operating, for whatever reason, then this talent
may not be used.  This talent may only be attempted once per set of
smells. When new smells are intro- duced, the Adept may be able to
identify these new smells by attempting this talent again, but any
previously unidentified smells will remain so.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-3]{Predict Weather}

\multiple{50}
\basechance{30\% + 4\% / Rank}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may predict the local weather over the next day (+ 1 / 3
Ranks). The Adept must be outside or able to see the sky to use this
ability.  If the Adept has resided in an area for a length of time
they will be more familiar with the local weather. If they have lived
in the area for over one month they will receive a bonus for
predicting weather in the season they are familiar with. If they have
lived in the area for over one year they will receive a bonus in any
season.

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={lXr}}
Time 	& Familiarity		& Bonus \\
1 month & Current season	& + 5\% † \\
1 year  & Complete		& +10\% † \\
\end{dqtblr}
†only one modifier applies.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept halts all gross or extreme non-magical air movement within a
volume of 10 foot (+ 10 / Rank) cubed.  The entire volume must be
within the Adept’s range.  The air within the volume will stay fresh
and will slowly intermingle with air outside the volume. Once cast the

\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell causes the target to drift gently downwards if they fall
more than 5 feet (should the target be falling faster than 5 feet per
pulse they will undergo a magical deceleration over one pulse).  The
target will be subject to wind effects while drifting downwards.

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Mage Wind}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept causes 1 wind-driven object to be affected by a magical wind
with an effective speed of up to 5 miles per hour (+ 1 / Rank). Only
the object targeted is affected by the magical wind.  By concentrating
the Adept may alter the direction and strength of the Mage wind.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Mist}

\range{20 feet + 20 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}

\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept conjures 1000 cubic feet of mist (+ 500 / additional Rank)
of any shape entirely within the Adept’s range. The mist must be at
least 1 foot in any dimension and may have detail no finer than 1 foot
in size. The visibility in this mist is normally 30 feet (6 hexes).
If the wind is stronger than a light breeze, the Adept must ac- tively
concentrate to maintain the mist. Otherwise, while the Adept actively
concentrates, the mist may be changed in one of the following ways:
\begin{Enumerate}
\item The Adept may move the mist up to 1 hex/pulse so long as it
  remains within range.

\item The Adept may change the visibility within the mist down to a
  minimum visibility of 6 hexes (-1 / 4 full Ranks).
\end{Enumerate}
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Speak to Avians}

\multiple{75}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap, Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The spell allows the target to communicate with any one type of aerial
life within range of the spell.  This communication usually consists
of sound and gesture. If the Adept wishes to converse with several
different types of aerial life concurrently then they may cast this
spell multiple times.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Storm Calling}

\range{Special}
\duration{60 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Special}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon any storm front which may exist anywhere in
sight. If no front can be seen, the spell can still be cast but the
Base Chance is modified by -20.  Generally, a storm front can be seen
for 20 to 30 miles. Upon reaching the spot occupied by the Adept at
the time of casting, the storm front will slow and finally cease
moving and begin to downpour (snow, rain, hail, sleet or whatever else
the GM feels the clouds may contain).  The storm front will take D10 ×
3 minutes (1 / Rank) to arrive, minimum 1.  Once the duration has
lapsed the weather will gradually return to normal over a similar
amount of time.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Summon Avians}

\range{5 miles}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Avians}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon one avian per Rank (minimum 1) to their current
location.  The avians must be native to or present in the area and the
Adept must specify the species (one per spell) that is being summoned.
The Adept may summon a specific avian providing it is within line of
sight (the species need not been known in this case). The avian will
arrive by the shortest flight path and their initial reaction will be
wary. The avians must have a clear flight path to the Adept and will
spend up to 5 minutes attempting to reach the Adept.  Note that not
all avians will have a movement rate which will allow them to reach
the Adept’s loca- tion within this time. This spell may not be cast if
the Adept is totally enclosed.  If the avian being summoned is
fantastical it gains a +20\% to its base chance to resist this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Vapour Breathing}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target can breathe any gas including otherwise poisonous vapours
(e.g.  Knockout Gas, Noxious Vapours etc).  This spell will not enable
the target to breathe in a vacuum or underwater.  Also, this spell
will not protect the target from any non-gaseous contents of the
atmosphere, e.g. Sleep Dust.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9]{Wind Whistle}

\range{Special}
\duration{D10 hours + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Special}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to create a wind over an open space of up to 100
feet (+ 100 / Rank) diameter centred on the Adept.  Outside of this
area, the wind will fade back to the prevailing wind over half again
the distance. The wind will build up over D + 5 minutes (1 / Rank,
minimum 1) and the Mage must choose at the time of casting which
direction the wind will blow.  The speed of the wind is determined by
rolling a D100 roll as follows:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={m{3em}lX}}
Dice	& Force	& Speed (mph) \\
01–05	& 5	& 19–24 \\
06–15	& 4	& 13–18 \\
16–30	& 3	& 8–12	\\
31–50	& 2	& 4–7	\\
51–70	& 3	& 8–12	\\
71–85	& 4	& 13–18	\\
86–95	& 5	& 19–24	\\
96–100	& 6	& 25–31	\\
\end{dqtblr}

The Adept can choose to modify the dice roll up or down by up to 2 ×
Rank points to determine the actual wind speed once the dice have been
rolled.  The effects of this spell override any existing wind effects
including already existing Wind Whistle spells.

If the resulting wind is Force 5 or over, missile fire will be
affected, reducing base chances by (wind speed/2)\%.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\section{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Windspeak}

\range{400 feet + 400 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{2 × MA + 3\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Area}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{None}
\actions{None}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can speak with the whispering spirits of the wind, learning
what they have seen or heard and even soliciting their aid.  All winds
within a range of 300 feet (+ 300 per rank) can be communed with in
this manner.  There is no backfire.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\section{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Air Blast}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity, Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell projects a narrow and extremely strong blast of air at the
target.  The blast will impact either on the target or on the first
obstruction blocking the path from the Adept to the target.  If the
target weighs less than 100 pounds (+ 20 / Rank) they will be thrown
back 10 feet (+5 per 3 full rank). On landing the target suffers
damage of [D - 5] + 1 per 3 full ranks and must make a 1 times PS + AG
check to remain standing.  The target is thrown in an arc away from
the Adept and the highest point of the arc equals (Rank + 1) feet.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Arrow Flight}

\range{5 feet}
\duration{20 minutes + 20 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Arrows or Quarrels}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can temporarily improve the flying quality of 2 (+ 1 / 2
Ranks) arrows or quarrels.  Anyone firing arrows or quarrels affected
by this spell has their Base Chance modified by +2\% (+ 1 / Rank). At
rank 16+ the arrows are counted as magical for determining which
entities may be harmed.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Avian Control}

\range{100 feet + 100 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration:  maximum  10  minutes  +10 / Rank }
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Avian}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may control 1 (+ 1 / Rank) avian within range unless the
avian successfully resists. If the avian is fantastical, it gains
+20\% on its base chance to resist this spell. If the Adept fails to
gain control or loses control, the avian will immediately attack the
Adept.  An avian which is still controlled when the spell duration
expires, will flee the Adept’s presence.  The Adept may recast this
spell before its duration has expired without breaking concentration.
When the duration of the first casting expires the target gets another
resistance check.  The Adept may also choose to release an avian from
their control before the spell’s duration is up, whereupon it will
flee as above.  If the avian is sentient and is made to take an action
that would endanger itself, another resistance check is made.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Barrier of Wind}

\range{5 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell forms a swirling pattern of wind around the entity in all
directions.  Thrown and missile weapons passing through the barrier
have a chance of being deflected from their course, to impact
harmlessly elsewhere.  The deflection adds 5 (+ 2 / Rank) to defence
against missiles.  This spell provides a bonus of 5 (+ 1 / Rank) in
melee or close combat.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Conjuring Air}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may conjure anywhere within their range 5 cubic feet (+ 5 /
Rank) of sweet smelling breathable air in any shape or shapes of their
choice.  No dimension of the shape may be less than 1 foot.  The
volume of air will hold its shape versus any non solid intrusions for
the full duration. At the end of the duration the volume will rapidly
disperse into the surrounding area, mixing with whatever atmosphere
was already there.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Flying}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell enables the target to fly at a speed of 30 mph (+ 1 / Rank)
by walking winds and air currents.  Initially it will take [D + 10 -
  Rank] minutes for the wind currents to arrive.  After the wind
currents have arrived the target can take off and land as many times
as they desire, but to recall the winds to take off after landing will
take [D + 2] pulses.  When taking off, it takes one pulse to
accelerate to full speed.  If the target tries to land, it will take
one pulse to slow to a standstill.  The target can only travel into
places where air currents or winds are possible.  This will not nor-
mally occur inside buildings or tunnels.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Gaseous Form}

\range{Self, touch at Rank 11+}
\duration{5 seconds + 5 / 2 Ranks}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Potion, Invested, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
When this spell is cast the target (and possessions) turn into a cloud
of vapour, that appears as a heavy mist.  The target may be affected
by magic spells.  Normal or silvered weapons do not harm the target,
but magical weapons may. The target may not use any possessions such
as weapons, nor may the target cast or trigger magic.  Magical or
Racial Talents may be used however.  The target may move up to TMR 2
in any direction and pass through any opening that is not airtight.
When the duration of the spell expires, the target will reform in the
nearest hollow space large enough to accommodate the target’s body.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Gliding}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Sentient Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell enables the target to glide at an angle of approximately 1
+ Rank feet horizontally for every foot of descent.  The target’s
maximum forward speed will be approximately 80 feet / pulse (+ 1 /
Rank) and their minimum vertical speed (relative to the air around
them) will be approximately 40 feet / pulse (-2 / Rank, minimum 1)
downwards.  If the target is gliding in thermals or down-drafts, their
actual rate of descent (or ascent) may vary.  The actual rate of
descent is up to the GM.  The target must keep their arms (or equiva-
lent) outstretched until landing or they will fall downwards, although
the spell will resume if the target returns their arms to an
outstretched position.  The target flies with their body horizontal
and may turn at a rate of 30 degrees / pulse (+ 5 / Rank) while
gliding.  The spell will cause the target to automatically become
vertical when within 5 feet of a horizontal surface. The target must
then make a flying roll when landing.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Knockout Gas}

\range{30 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates a heavy cloud of knockout gas that rises 10 (+ 1 /
Rank) feet above the ground.  The area has a diameter of 15 feet (+ 5
/ Rank).  At ranks: 0 to 9 the cloud appears as a translucent mist
(i.e. does not inhibit vision) and is pungent smelling, 10 to 15 the
gas is invisible and pungent smelling, 16 and above the cloud becomes
invisible and odourless.  Any entity (including the Adept) within the
gas must resist.  If they fail to resist, they must roll under 2 × EN
each pulse or fall unconscious (not asleep) while they remain within
the gas.  Any wind over 15 mph will disperse the gas in D-Force
pulses.  Once the gas is dispersed, the duration expires, or a victim
is removed from the area, any unconscious entities will recover in 1
pulse (+ 1 / 5 full Ranks).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Lightning Bolt}

\range{60 feet}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{225}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity, Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may throw a single bolt of lightning 60 feet long from their
fingertips.  The bolt must extend the entire 60 feet and will deflect
off stone until it reaches its full extent. All targets that are in
the path of the bolt must resist or suffer [D + 5] (+ 1 / 3 Ranks)
damage (save for half damage).  In addition, any target who fails to
resist is automatically stunned.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Lightning Strike}

\range{15 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates sheets of lightning that slowly arc around the
entity’s body doing no damage.  This is extremely obvious.  The first
time the entity takes damage from a blow in combat and the attacker is
within range, a bolt will strike out at the entity’s attacker doing [D
  - 4] (+ 1 / 2 Ranks) damage (save for half damage).  The spell then
dissipates.  The Range is 5 feet (+ 5 / Rank).  At rank 10 or greater,
any attacker who fails to resist and is capable of being stunned is
automatically stunned.  This spell cannot be cast on a target if they
are already under the effect of a Lightning Strike spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-12]{Resist Cold}

\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell protects the target from the effects of cold temperature by
increasing the Gauge by 1 (+ 1 / 4 full ranks) up to a maximum of
Gauge 7 (Comfortable).  It will totally protect the target from the
effects of Hypothermia at rank 11+.  In addition, the target suffers 1
(+ 1 / 4 full ranks) less damage due to magical or non-magical cold
based attacks.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-13]{Shaping Cloud}

\range{5 miles + 1 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: maximum 1 minute + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Cloud band}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can cause some of a cloud bank (cloud degree 5+) within
range and line of sight to slowly shape a different image in it each
minute.  Each new shape will be gradually formed from the old over the
course of the minute. The shape in the clouds is recognisable up to a
range of 5 miles (+ 1 / Rank).  Measurements for this spell should be
taken from the ground (i.e. disregarding the height of the cloud
bank).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-14]{Whirlwind Vortex}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{650}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates a tornado around one human sized target for every 3
or fraction ranks (minimum 1). If the target fails to resist they are
so tossed and torn by the winds that muscles and ligaments tear,
joints dislocate, bones break, organs rupture, and they perish.  If
the target successfully resists they suffer [D - 4] (+ 1 / Rank)
damage due to excessive forces (instead of perishing).  Targets that
fail to resist may be resurrected.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-15]{Whispering Wind}

\range{100 miles + 100 / Rank}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
This spell sends a message to an entity using the winds. The Adept
must know the name of the entity and be able to pick them out from a
crowd.  The maximum length of the message is 5 words per rank. The
messages will be in the voice of the Adept at the same volume as when
spoken, and can only be heard by the target.  There is a noticeable
but minor effect of swirling air when the message is sent and
received.  The time taken for the message to reach the entity (the
duration) is 1 hour (+ 2 minutes per mile) - rank hours (minimum of 1
hour).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-16]{Windstorm}

\range{30 feet + 30 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a windstorm of Force 9 centred on the Adept and
extending out to the full range of the spell.  Once cast the Windstorm
will not move. The winds in the area of a windstorm are random and
violent, they do not prevail in a particular direction. All entities
within this area except the Adept and those in the same hex must check
against 2 × (Physical Strength + Agility) - 2 × Rank, every pulse, to
regain their feet and/or re- main upright. Every time an entity within
the area falls prone, they take [D - 2] damage. This damage is
physical.  For the duration of this spell they have their TMR halved.
All entities attempting to use missile or thrown weapons through or
inside the area of effect have their Base Chance reduced by 5 per
every 2 hexes of Windstorm travelled through.

\begin{spell}[S-17]{Wind Walking}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{30 seconds + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell (and possessions) turns into wind, keeping
their approximate size and appearance. In the first pulse, the spell’s
effect is to accelerate the target to full speed and in the last
pulse, the target will gradually slow.  The distance travelled over
the first and last pulse is half that of normal. The target moves
through the air at 50 mph (+ 5 / Rank).  The target can only pass
through an area that they could pass through normally.  The target
chooses the direction of the flight but the speed may not be altered.
The target will not collide with stationary objects during the flight,
but if rushing directly towards an object or wall, will brush along or
past it as a wind would.  If blown down a corridor to a dead end or
similar situation, the target will not stop but double back in a tight
loop.  Anything dropped by the target will go in a random direction.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-18]{Ball of Lightning}

\range{35 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity or Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates a ball of lightning which shoots from the caster to
the target.  The ball is utterly silent and moves in a straight
line. Anything standing between the caster and the target will be
struck instead.  Upon striking anything the ball explodes, in a bright
flash, causing [D - 1] (+ 1 per Rank) electrical damage.  If the
target successfully resists the damage is halved (round up), otherwise
they are also blinded for Rank / 4 pulses (round down).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-19]{Thunderclap}

\range{20 feet + 20 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{325}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept causes the air in the targeted area to violently compress
with a loud crash.  The target area has a diameter of 5’ at Ranks 0–5,
15’ at Ranks 6–12, 25’ at Ranks 13–19, and 35’ at Rank 20.  The
entirety of the affected area must be within the caster’s spell range
for the spell to be effective.  All those within the area suffer [D +
  1] (+ 1 per 2 full Ranks) concussive damage (resist for half — round
up). Those failing to resist can hear nothing except a loud ringing
for Rank pulses. On a Double or Triple effect any entities which fail
to resist are also stunned (normal stun recovery applies).  Note that
this spell can be heard from a distance as per normal thunder.

\material{None}
\actions{None}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can open a one way portal 2 feet in diameter from the
elemental plane of Air from which fresh clean air flows. The rate of
flow is 5 cubic feet (+ 5 / Rank) per second.  Additionally any
modifier for being enclosed is reduced by 5.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-2]{Conjuring Air Elemental}

\range{20 feet}
\duration{Concentration: No maximum}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{MA + 5\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Air Elemental}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{None}
\actions{None}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon an Air Elemental and bind it to temporary service
by performing this ritual. At the end of the ritual a Cast Check is
performed.  If the ritual is successful the Elemental is summoned and
controlled.  If the ritual backfires then the Elemental is summoned
but no controlled and will attack the summoner and companions.

The Air elemental will always appear within 20 feet of the summoner.
If has a combined Endurance and Fatigue equal to 15 (+ 15 / Rank).
The Elemental will remain until it is sent back to its home plane by
the Adept (with Special Knowledge Counterspell of the college of Air
Magics) or banished.  If it is controlled by the summoner it will
remain controlled until the summoner’s concentra- tion is broken.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-3]{Control Weather}

\duration{8 hours + 8 hours / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{2 × MA + 3\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Area}
\casttime{1 hour}
\actions{Dance (2 FT when unencumbered)}
\concentration{None}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may change one or more of the three components which make up
the weather by performing a ritual dance. The three components of
weather are:

• Precipitation, Degree  

• Temperature, Gauge  

• Wind, Force 

The GM should consult the weather table and advise the Adept of the
current level of each of these three components before they start
dancing.  The Adept may change the current components by a total of 1
+1 per 2 full ranks.

At rank 12, the Adept can change a Force 3 
\begin{example}
wind into a Force 10 wind or Force 3 into Force 7 and Degree 5 into
Degree 2 cloud cover.
\end{example}

All the changes may be in any direction on the table.

This ritual will not cause weather effects outside the normal climatic
range of the area (as determined by the GM).  The weather will change
gradually over (30 - 1 / Rank) minutes per level shifted on the table
and the three components will change simultaneously. The area of
effect is circular with a radius of 1 mile / Rank (minimum 1).
Casting this ritual counts as strenuous activity and the Adept will
lose fatigue. This ritual cannot back- fire.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-4]{Summon and Bind Cloud}

\range{5 miles + 5 / Rank}
\duration{5 hours + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{2 × MA + 3\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Clouds}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{None}
\actions{None}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
This ritual will summon a quantity of cirro-cumulus cloud and change
its consistency to that of packed cotton wool to provide a method of
transport.  Items will pass through the cloud after 30 seconds unless
supported by an Entity.  The cloud arrives during the last half hour
of casting and spends the first and last half hour of travel rising to
and descending from its natural travelling height.  The natural height
of cirro-cumulus clouds is between 2 and 4 miles above sea level
(10,000 to 20,000 feet). The cloud may support 1 entity (+ 1 / Rank)
and transports them in a comfortable and oxygenated environment,
although it may be slightly cold if improperly clothed.  Flying
entities may take off or land on the cloud as long as the above limit
is maintained. If more entities land on a cloud than it can carry, it
will immediately start to descend taking half an hour and dissipate
upon reaching the ground.  The cloud appears to be a normal cloud but
is sufficiently soft to prevent injury to anything that impacts it
(it’s also non-flammable). The clouds will move with the prevailing
winds or can be moved with magical winds such as Mage Wind. By
actively concentrating the Adept can cause the clouds to move at a
different speed or in a different direction to the prevailing wind.
The Adept can alter the movement of the clouds by 2 miles per hour (+
2 / Rank) in any one direction.  The altitude of the clouds may not be
controlled.  While in contact with the ground the clouds will not
move.

  association with the environment the Adept can modify the Force
  downwards, and Gauge upwards on the Weather Scale Table by 1 per 4
  rank, for themselves.

\item[S-12 Resist Cold (Air Mage Spell)] This spell protects the
  target from the effects of cold temperature by increasing the Gauge
  by 1 (+ 1 / 4 full ranks) up to a maximum of Gauge 7.

\item[R-3 Control Weather (Air Mage Ritual)] The Adept may change the
  current components by 1 + 1 per 2 full ranks. The resulting weather
