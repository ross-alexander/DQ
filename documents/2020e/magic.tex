\section{Introduction to Magic}

Magic represents the effects of the unknown forces that shape and
control the worlds. Those who have talent and knowledge can tap these
energies (known as mana) and shape them to their own ends. These
people are known as Mages. They are usually either revered or reviled
by the normal population.

There are three types of Magic: Talent, Spell, and Ritual.  Talent
Magic operates more or less immediately, while Spell and Ritual Magic
require preparation before taking effect.  Spells may be prepared in
seconds or minutes, but Rituals take hours (and sometimes many weeks)
to perform.

There are a number of separate Colleges of Magic.  Each represents a
specific type of magic, and each has a list of Spells, Rituals and
Talents available only to Adepts of that College. Most of the magic
detailed within these rules is College magic.

\subsection{Definitions:}

\begin{Description}

\item[Consecrated Ground] Any ground that has been consecrated to the
  “Powers of Light” affects the Magic Resistance of all within
  it. There is no College specifically dedicated to the Powers of
  Light, because they are, in effect, opposed to the use of magic.
  Most temples and monasteries and some graveyards will be consecrated
  ground.  Barrows, pagan temples and the dwellings of magical beings
  can never be consecrated ground.  Undead and Necromancers suffer
  special penalties on consecrated ground.

\item[Counterspell] A type of spell which helps to protect individuals
  and areas against the effects of a particular College of Magic.

\item[Fatigue Cost] The amount of energy, in the form of Fatigue, that
  a Mage must expend in order to cast a spell.

\item[General Knowledge] All Colleges of Magic have a body of Spells,
  Talents and Rituals which are classified as General Knowledge.
  These magics are taught to all Adepts of the College during their
  initial training.

\item[High Mana] An area that is rich in mana is referred to as a high
  mana area.  Such areas are rare, and include locations where human
  sacrifice is practised or where the inter-planar boundaries are
  weak, and mana leaks through.  Often mountain tops or clearings in
  jungles will contain such areas.  They are likely to be well guarded
  by beasts and individuals attracted by the mana, including a larger
  than usual proportion of fantastical beasts.  Magic is easier to
  perform in these areas.

\item[Active Resistance] A special type of Magic Resistance, where the
  entity can choose to concentrate their attention on resisting a
  magical effect, and thus reduce its Cast Chance by their Magic
  Resistance. Only some magic is actively resistible.

\item[Low Mana] An area with depleted mana is known as a low mana
  area.  Most densely populated or civilised parts of the world are
  Low Mana, as are some battle-scarred areas.  Magic is harder to cast
  in low mana areas.

\item[Adept] A member of a College of Magic is known as an Adept.

\item[Backfire] If a spell or ritual is particularly incompetently
  cast, unpredictable and often dangerous effects can occur.  This is
  colloquially known as a backfire.

\item[Branches of Magic] There are 3 branches of Magic: the
  Thaumaturgies, the theoretical branch of Magic including the Bardic,
  E \& E, Mind, Naming, Illusion and Binding Colleges; the Elementals,
  the naturalistic branch of Magic that includes the Earth, Water,
  Fire, Air, Ice and Celestial Colleges; and the Entities, the old,
  “dark” branch of Magic that includes the Necromantic, Rune,
  Summoning and Witchcraft Colleges.  The Thaumaturgies and Entities
  are opposed to each other.

\item[Cast Chance] The modified Base Chance of effectively casting a
  spell or performing a ritual.

\item[Cast Check] The game mechanic whereby a Mage’s player determines
  the result of an attempted spell or ritual.

\item[Cold Iron] All solid metals that are primarily composed of iron
  ore are termed Cold Iron.  This in- cludes both Iron and Steel. Such
  metals in a liquid state are not “cold”. Cold Iron inhibits the
  ability of Mages to use mana.

\item[College ] Most magic is divided up into numerous Colleges, each
  of which specialise in a type of magic (e.g.  Fire, Necromancy).  A
  Mage who has joined a particular College is known as an Adept of
  that College, and may not belong to another College without first
  forsaking all knowledge of their previous College.

\item[Concentration] If a spell has a concentration component in its
  duration, then the Adept must concen- trate in order to maintain the
  spell.  A Mage may only have one concentration spell in effect at
  any time.

\item[Mage] Any sentient being who can manipulate mana to produce
  (often fantastic) results (excluding racial Talents). A Mage must
  have a Magical Aptitude characteristic.

\item[Magic Resistance] All targets with a Willpower value have the
  capacity to resist some magics directed against them.  This ability
  is their Magic Resistance, and is a function of their Willpower.
  Not all magic is resistible.

\item[Magical Animates] Anything that has been animated, except
  undead, is a magical animate. Some Magical animates gain a magic
  resistance.  Only those animates that have a Magical Aptitude or
  Willpower gain a Magic Resistance.  Those animates that have
  neither MA nor WP have no resis- tance to magic, and in addition,
  may be affected by spells that affect Entities and those that affect
  objects.

\item[Mana] The type of energy that is used in all magic.  A Mage must
  draw upon mana to perform any magic.  If there is no mana present, a
  Mage cannot perform any magic.

\item[Object] An item wholly composed of never living or formerly
  living matter, or some combination thereof.  Objects do not have a
  Magic Resistance except when they are Possessions or Magical
  Animates.

\item[Passive Resistance] This is the default Magic Resistance made by
  all targets with willpower and operates automatically against all
  spells that may be passively resisted.  It is possible to stop
  passively resisting temporarily.

\item[Place of Power] Certain places aid the practise of magic.  The
  most well known places are Earth places of power, but they exist for
  all the Elemental and Entity Colleges (excluding Rune). Such places
  are rare, and often co-exist with High Mana areas.

\item[Possessions] Possessions are those objects held, carried or
  otherwise within the personal area of an Entity. They are affected
  by those spells that affect the Entity, and are entitled to the
  Entity’s Magic Resistance.

\item[Resistance Check] The game mechanic which determines whether a
  resisting entity is fully affected by a magical effect.

\item[Ritual Magic] Complex procedures and techniques that require the
  Mage to spend large amounts of preparation time (and often
  ingredients) to complete successfully.

\item[Special Knowledge] All Colleges of Magic have a body of complex
  or specialised spells and rituals which are not taught to mere
  apprentices, but which are gained with time and effort after the
  Adepts prove themselves worthy. These magics are termed Special
  Knowledge.

\item[Spell Magic] Codified magical formulae that take anywhere from a
  few seconds to a minute to perform, require energy from the Mage,
  and which result in specific alterations to Natural Law.

\item[Talent Magic] Magical abilities that require mana, but no energy
  and minimal time from the user.  Many species have racial Talents.

\end{Description}

\section{How Magic Works}

There are three types of Magic: Talent, Spell and Ritual Magic.

\begin{Description}
  
\item[Talent Magic] is broken into Racial and College Talents.
  Talents are common to all members of a Race or College of which they
  are a characteristic part and may never be learned or forgotten,
  though they often may be “ranked”.  Talents require no preparation,
  take a maximum of 5 seconds to utilise, and require no expenditure
  of energy.  All Talents can be classified as either active or
  passive.  Passive Talents are always in effect. Active Talents
  require a Pass Action to utilise, and often require rolls to see if
  they succeed.  Racial Talents are described in Character
  Generation. College Talents are discussed in the individual
  Colleges.

\item[Spell Magic] constitutes the great majority of the magic
  utilised by Mages.  Unless otherwise stated, all magic mentioned in
  these rules is Spell Magic.  All Spell Magic has the following
  characteristics in common:

  Each individual Spell has a defined range, duration, base chance and
  effect. Spells must usually be prepared by the Mage through a
  process of incantation to draw mana to activate the Spell.  Spells
  are unstable in their workings, and if cast ineptly, may fail
  entirely or have unexpected effects on the vicinity. The casting of
  a Spell drains energy from the caster in the form of tiredness
  Fatigue.

\item[Ritual Magic] requires the expenditure of large blocks of time
  (usually hours) and usually certain conditions must be fulfilled
  while performing the Ritual.  Ritual Magic occasionally requires a
  large number of special tools and substances and may be restricted
  to particular times or places.  Magical effects from Ritual Magic
  tend to be more powerful, prolonged or delayed than those of Spells.
  Most rituals require a Cast Check to determine whether the ritual
  was successful.  If not otherwise stated in the specific ritual
  description, a ritual may backfire (roll greater than Base Change +
  30) with similar consequences to a spell.  Rituals may also cause a
  multiple effect similar to spells.

\end{Description}

\subsection{Material}

Some spells and rituals require material components.  These materials
must be present to perform the magic.  If the spell or ritual also has
a Material Cost then unless stated otherwise in the descrip- tion,
these materials are consumed during the casting of the magic
regardless of the success or failure of the casting.


\subsection{Extended Rituals}

Some rituals require a far greater time to perform than the standard
one hour, possibly requiring weeks or even months.  During these
rituals the Adept is not involved in constant concentration.  The
Adept may eat, sleep (8 hours a day) and perform other activities
requiring less than 2 hours a day while engaged in a lengthy ritual.
During the extended ritual the Adept can utilise only stored magic,
and that inherent in the ritual.

\section{How to Cast Spells}

Casting a Spell is a complex process. 

\begin{Description}
  \item[Preparing] Firstly, the spell must be prepared and mana
    gathered for the spell.  This does not require any fatigue, and
    normally carries no risk. However, it does involve gesticulations
    and conversation level speech, which will be obvious to observers.
    The spell may be prepared in 5 seconds, 1 minute, or multiples of
    an hour (using Ritual Spell preparation). The length of time taken
    to prepare the spell is proportional to the resulting safety of
    the Mage.  The length of time spent preparing a spell must be
    decided upon in advance.  Preparing a spell is subject to the
    restrictions mentioned in §7.6.

\item[Casting] Once prepared, the spell is Cast by an expenditure of
  Energy in the form of tiredness Fatigue, used to shape and direct
  the magic.  This takes 5 seconds.  Once cast, a spell will either
  impact upon its target or fail.  If the spell impacts on its target,
  it may be partially or wholly resisted.  If the spell fails, it may
  backfire (see §7.7).  If the spell is cast particularly competently,
  it may be especially effective.
\end{Description}

\subsection{Casting Mechanics}

\begin{Description}

\item[Preparation] The Mage’s player announces the spell and length of
  preparation (either 5 seconds, 1 minute, or a number of hours). They
  may break off their preparation at any time and abort the casting
  process.  A spell must be used immediately upon being prepared or it
  is dissipated and the preparation must be restarted before it can be
  Cast.  Only one spell can be prepared at any one time.  At the end
  of the preparation, the Mage is aware of the state of the
  surrounding mana.  During combat, Preparing is a Pass Action.

\item[Casting] The Mage’s player announces the spell, its target, and
  any additional options desired (such as lowering the Rank of some
  attributes).  During combat, Casting is a Fire Action.

\item[Cast Check] The player then modifies the Base Chance of the
  spell due to current conditions to produce a Cast Chance as a
  percentage.  This Cast Chance is then compared with a D100 roll.  If
  the die roll is less than or equal to the Cast Chance, the spell
  works.  If the die roll is less than 5\% of the Cast Chance, the
  spell succeeds with a “triple effect”.  If the die roll is between
  6\% and 15\% of the Cast Chance, the spell succeeds with a “double
  effect”.  If the die roll is more than 30 higher than the Cast
  Chance (with 5 second preparation), or 40 higher than the Cast
  Chance (with longer preparation), the spell has not only failed, but
  Backfired, as per §7.7.

\item[Fatigue] A Mage may not cast a spell unless they have sufficient
  Fatigue to pay the expected Fatigue cost.  At the end of the
  preparation, the state of the Mana (none, Low, normal or High) is
  known, and the Mage may abandon the attempt at that point, before
  losing the Fatigue.  Whether the spell succeeds, fails or backfires,
  the Mage must pay the Fatigue cost.  It usually costs 1 Fatigue point
  to cast a General Knowledge Spell or 2 Fatigue points to cast a
  Special Knowledge Spell.  In a High Mana area, these Fatigue costs
  are reduced by one.  In a Low Mana area, the Fatigue Cost is
  doubled.

\item[Success] If the Cast Check is a double or triple effect, the
  element to be doubled or tripled must be decided before anything
  else is resolved.  If the Cast Check is a success or better, the
  target(s) may resist the spell, if it is passively resistible (see
  §7.8 for details).  This will reduce or nullify the effects of the
  spell, as defined in the individual spell description. See §7.5 to
  resolve the spell effects. Note that some backfires will result in
  partial success.

\item[Failure] Nothing occurs (except Fatigue loss).  If the result is
  a backfire, consult the Backfire Table §53.

\end{Description}


\section{Cast Check Modifiers}

In addition to the individual College modifiers, all Mages receive the
following modifiers whenever engaging in Spell casting:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={Xr}}
Each point the Mage’s MA is greater than 15		& +1 \\
Each point the Mage’s MA is less than 15		& -1 \\
Each Rank the Mage has with the spell they are casting	& +3 \\ 
Each hour the Mage engages in Ritual Spell preparation	& +3 \\
\end{dqtblr}


\section{Spell Effects}

Spells which are successfully cast on valid targets immediately take
effect on those targets (unless explicitly stated within the spell
description). If the spell is Passively Resistible, as stated in the
individual spell, all targets with a Willpower value may resist at
their current Magic Resistance.  A successful resistance may reduce
the spell effect for the target, or even nullify the effects
altogether.  In some cases, the duration, damage, or other aspect, may
be random, and will need to be determined.  If the Cast Check is a
double or triple effect, the element to be doubled or tripled must be
decided before anything else is resolved.

All magic works in quanta.  Any attribute of any magic may be
performed at any Rank up to the Mage’s maximum level of skill, but
only at a whole number of Ranks.  It is assumed that all attributes
are being cast at maximum, unless it is otherwise stated before the
Cast Check is made.

\subsection{Damage}

Damage due to magic ignores armour and does not cause stunning, unless
a strike check against the target’s defence is required as part of the
spell.  Damage is done to Fatigue, and to Endurance once Fatigue is
exhausted. A single Damage Check will not “wrap” from Fatigue to
Endurance, unless the total damage exceeds the target’s combined full
Fatigue and Endurance.

\subsection{Doubles and Triples}

There are three characteristics of a spell which can be increased by
the Mage as a result of a spell causing a double or triple effect:
Range, Duration and Damage.

Whenever a spell is cast for double effect, the Mage has the option to
double one of Range, Duration or Damage. Some spells may not have one
or more of these attributes. Such attributes may not be affected.

Whenever a spell is cast for triple effect, the Mage has the option of
either tripling one of Range, Duration or Damage; doubling any two of
these attributes; or decreasing the target’s Magic Resistance by 20.

A Mage may attempt to cast a spell at a target which is not within
range in the hope of achieving a double or triple effect.


\section{Restrictions on Magic}

Mages are restricted as to where and when they can employ
magic. General restrictions that apply to all Mages are covered in
this section. Specific restrictions applying to Adepts of particular
Colleges are covered in the opening sections of those Colleges.

\subsection{Cold Iron}

A Mage may never prepare or cast a spell or engage in Ritual Magic
while in physical contact with Cold Iron.  They may exercise any
Racial Talent Magic, but no learnt Talent Magic.  Wearing armour made
of Cold Iron, or holding weapons or tools made of Cold Iron is
regarded as being in physical contact.  GM discretion covers all other
cases.  Several ounces of Cold Iron is required to cut off the mana
flow.

There are several possible means of circumventing the effects of cold
iron:

\begin{Enumerate}

\item The Mage may drop all iron items prior to performing any
  magic. Note that donning and doffing armour is very time consuming.

\item The Mage may employ weapons, tools and armour that are not
  metallic (e.g. quarterstaff, leather armour).  Weapons that are
  normally metallic can be made out of wood, bone or stone, but their
  Base Chance is reduced by 10, their Damage reduced by 2 and their
  Fumble chance increases (see §6.10). A similar loss of effectiveness
  will be experienced with other tools that are normally iron.

\item The Mage may use metallic items that have no iron content, such
  as copper, tin and bronze.  Such items cost the same as equivalent
  iron items, but they are less effective: weapons do one less point
  of damage, and fumble on a 98 to 00 roll (instead of just a 00); and
  armour provides two less points of protection.

\item The effects of cold iron can be neutralised by combining it with
  precious metal (silver or truesilver).  Such items are as effective
  as Iron items.  Silvered items costs at least 10 times the standard
  price and truesilvered items 180 times the cost.  A Mage’s Cast
  Chances are reduced by 10 if carrying silvered items. Wearing Cold
  Iron does not protect from the effects of magic.

\end{Enumerate}


\subsection{Confinement}

A Mage must have the freedom to make the necessary gestures and sounds
in order to cast a spell or perform a ritual.  Mute, bound, paralysed,
unconscious, stunned, prone or restrained Mages may not use Spell or
Ritual Magic, though Talent Magic is usually possible.  In addition,
an Adept must have at least one hand free and be able to speak clearly
to prepare and cast a spell.

\subsection{Proper Procedure}

A Mage may never employ a type of Magic, whether a Spell, Ritual or
Talent, which they have not learnt.  The Mage also must have whatever
equipment or working materials are specified in the Spell or Ritual
description.

\subsection{Concentration}

A Mage may not cast a spell or perform a ritual if their concentration
is broken.  This usually occurs by being engaged in Melee or Close
Combat.  Other types of attack or distraction may also suffice. If an
event is deemed distracting, the Mage’s player must roll a 4 times
Willpower check to maintain concentration, or the spell or ritual is
disrupted.

The concentration required to control spells already cast, or the
concentration required to control an entity, will not be broken by
entering combat or being attacked.  It will only be broken if they are
stunned, knocked out or killed.

\subsection{Queuing}

Spells that have the same effects are not cumulative.  If a spell is
cast on a target that is already under the effect of a spell which has
the same effect, then the spell “queues”.  This means that, although
the spell is in effect on the target, it has no effect until the
earlier spell is gone.

Spells with any overlapping effects are affected by this rule.  Note
that it is the spells’ effects that are important, not the spell
itself.  If the spells both affect one attribute (e.g.  defence), they
queue.  If two spells affect different attributes (e.g. PS \& FT),
they stack.  This rule also applies to items.  Unless stated
otherwise, any item that contains a magical effect that can be caused
by a spell, cannot be affected by that spell (e.g. a weapon with a
magical bonus to hit or damage may not stack with Weapon of Flames).

The duration of the second, queuing, spell is measured from casting,
but it only takes effect when the first spell wears off.


\section{Backfires}

Particularly inept Spell casts or Ritual performances may cause
backfires.  If the Mage’s Cast Check fails by more than 30 for a 5
second Spell preparation or Ritual performance, or 40 for a longer
Spell preparation, the Magic backfires. The Magic will always backfire
on a natural roll of 100, unless the Cast Chance is over 100\%, in
which case the Magic fails. The GM rolls on the Backfire Table (§53)
and applies the result.  Effects include extra Fatigue loss, partial
or awry magical effects, and curses and afflictions on the caster.

\subsection{Backfire Interpretation}

The effects are to be interpreted as widely as desired by the GM.  All
curses and afflictions are resistible, and partial or awry effects may
be also, depending on the magic.  All backfire effects are cumulative.
It may be impossible to apply a specific backfire effect in certain
situations.  This is generally described by “No apparent effect”,
along with most subtle afflictions. The effects of a backfire should
be kept secret for as long as possible.

In most cases, specific reductions in numerical ratings are given when
a Mage is cursed as a result of a backfire.  However, ancillary
effects of the curse must be determined within the guidelines of the
curse description.


\section{Magic Resistance}

An entity who is the target of a spell may resist the spell if it is
resistible. There are two types of resistance: Active Resistance
reduces the Cast Chance of a spell; Passive Resistance avoids or
reduces the effects of a spell. Magic Resistance is used for both
Active and Passive Resistance.  It is equal to an entity’s Willpower,
modified as follows:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={Xm{3em}}}
Target and caster are of the same Branch of Magic			& -5 \\
Target and caster are of opposed Branches of Magic			& +5 \\
Target is sentient but not a Mage					& +20 \\
Target is in a consecrated area						& +50 \\
Target has on, or is in the area of, the appropriate counterspell	& +30 +3/Rank \\
Spell had triple effect and the caster chose to affect Magic Resistance	& -20 \\
\end{dqtblr}

Branches of Magic are covered in §7.10.  Sentient entities are those
with an MA of 0 or greater.  Counterspells are covered in §10.2.
Triple Effects are covered in §7.5. Consecration is not covered in
these rules.

Purification, certain other spells, and many items also affect Magic
Resistance.

If an entity successfully resists a targeted spell, then they will be
aware that they have resisted some Magic. While the spell did not
directly affect the entity, their aura is marked sufficiently that the
last spell to impact is determinable. Note that only spells which
target possessions or entities are noticeable in this way.  Spells
which affect an area cannot be detected when a character resists them.

Objects cannot normally resist Magic.  However, if the object is an
entity’s possession, and the spell can be passively resisted, then the
entity may apply their normal resistance.

\subsection{Passive Resistance}

When a spell that is passively resistible impacts on an entity, the
entity may attempt to resist the effects of the spell.  This is known
as Passive Resistance. The player must roll D100.  If the die roll is
less than or equal to the entity’s Magic Resistance, the spell’s
effects are reduced or nullified. Passive Resistance is an automatic
bodily function which occurs regardless of whether an entity is
conscious or not.  If an entity re-encounters an area effect magic,
they must re-resist, whether they successfully resisted last time or
not.  At the start of a pulse, an entity may choose to not resist.
For the remainder of the pulse, the entity may not passively resist
any spells, unless they become stunned or unconscious.  While choosing
to not resist, an entity may only perform a pass action.

\subsection{Active Resistance}

An entity can choose to actively resist another entity. When an entity
attempts to cast or trigger a spell which is actively resistible, then
the highest Magic Resistance of any target who is actively resisting
the entity is subtracted from the Cast Chance.  Note that Active
Resistance is only effective if the entity who is actively resisting
is a target, or in the area of effect of the spell. In combat, Active
Resistance is a Pass Action. An entity must concentrate on the caster
in order to actively resist them.  Anything that can disrupt Spell
preparation can also disrupt Active Resistance.  Active Resistance
against a spell that is not able to be actively resisted, or against a
spell which is not targeted at the entity, has no effect.


\section{Incorporating Magic into Combat}

Spell Magic may be employed, usually with 5 second preparation. A Mage
must perform a magical pass action to prepare and a cast action to
cast a spell. See §6.4 and §6.6 for what can be done during pass and
cast actions in combat.

Talent Magic may be used during combat. Passive talents operate
normally and do not require any actions to employ. Active talents
(e.g. Detect Aura) require a pulse to implement.  An entity may
actively resist a spell during combat by implementing a pass action.
They may lower passive resistance during any pass action. Triggering
an invested item takes one full pulse irrespective of the number of
actions that can be performed.

Ritual Magic is difficult to employ during combat.  During each pulse
that noisy or dangerous events take place, the Mage may need to make a
concentration check (as per §7.6).


\section{The Colleges of Magic}

Most Magic is divided into 16 Colleges representing specific types of
magic.  A Mage may only employ the powers and spells of one College.
If a Mage belongs to a College, they are known as an Adept.

\subsection{Branches of Magic}

The Colleges are divided into three Branches of Magic, as follows:

\subsubsection{The Thaumaturgies:}
The College of Bardic Magics \\
The College of Binding and Animating \\
The College of Ensorcelments and Enchantments \\
The College of Illusions \\
The College of Sorceries of the Mind \\
The College of Naming Incantations 

\subsubsection{The Elementals:}
The College of Air Magics \\
The College of Celestial Magics \\
The College of Earth Magics \\ 
The College of Fire Magics \\
The College of Ice Magics \\
The College of Water Magics 

\subsubsection{The Entities:}
The College of Greater Summonings \\
The College of Necromantic Conjurations \\
The College of Rune Magics \\
The College of Witchcraft

An Adept’s Magic Resistance is affected by their Branch of Magic.
Their resistance against spells of the same branch as their own is
increased by 5, while their resistance against magic of the opposed
branch is reduced by 5. Thaumaturgies and Entities are opposed
Branches.  The Elemental Branch is not opposed to any group of Magics.

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={XXXX}}
		& Thaum		& Elemental	& Entity \\
Thaum		& Same		& Neutral	& Opposed \\ 
Elemental	& Neutral	& Same		& Neutral \\
Entity		& Opposed	& Neutral	& Same \\
\end{dqtblr}

\subsection{Restrictions and Modifications}

Each College of Magic has its own individual minimum Magical Aptitude
requirement.  This must be met at the time any entity becomes an Adept
of the college.  Many Colleges have restrictions on casting magic
further to those in §7.6.  These are specified in the first
sub-section of each College.

Most Colleges are subject to certain modifications to Cast Chances in
addition to §7.4.  These are specified in the second sub-section of
each College.

\subsection{Learning College Magic}

An Adept is assumed to have mastered all of the General Knowledge
magic of their College upon the completion of their training. This
mastery is at Rank 0. Special Knowledge magic is not taught to
novices, and can only be acquired by expending time (and usually
money) to learn it to Rank 0.  Most Special Knowledge magic is
available at the Guild, at fixed prices.  All General and Special
Knowledge magic may be ranked to Rank 20 by the expenditure of time
and experience.

An Adept must have ranked a spell or ritual to Rank 6 before they can
teach it.  They must have ranked all talents, and general knowledge
spells and rituals to Rank 6 before they can teach a novice their
College.

In general, an Adept may never use spells, talents, or rituals of more
than one College of Magic at one time (except Counterspells). An Adept
may change College but loses all General and Special Knowledge magics
from their old College, and must spend 6 months (and 6,500 EP)
learning the ways of the new College (including characters learning
acollege for the first time).  Once an Adept has renounced a College,
they may never return to it.

\subsection{Knowledge Limitations}

An Adept may only employ Talents, Spells and Rituals that they
know. They may know any number of talents, but may not know more
spells and rituals below Rank 6 than their Magical Aptitude.  They may
know an unlimited number of Spells and Rituals of Rank 6 or higher.
All General and Special Knowledge Spells and Rituals of the Adept’s
College, plus whatever non-Colleged magics known, apply to this limit
(except Ritual Spell Preparation, and as specified in the Namer
College).  This includes Counterspells of other Colleges.

An entity may not become an Adept of a College of Magic unless they
have the Magical Aptitude to account for mastery of the General
Knowledge spells and Rituals of that College.  This is enumerated in
the restrictions of the College.  An Adept may not learn another spell
or ritual if they already know as many spells and rituals (below Rank
6) as they have points in MA.

If, as a result of a decrease of Magical Aptitude or spell ranks, the
Adept knows more spells and rituals below Rank 6 than their Magical
Aptitude, then they will permanently lose sufficient knowledge to
satisfy this rule, losing the lowest ranked magics first. They will
still remain Adepts of their College, while sentient.


\section{Magic Descriptions}

The description of all the College Magics work under certain
conventions.  The more important of them follow:

\subsection{Sub-Sections}

Each College description is broken up into  

\begin{Itemize}
  
\item An Introduction

\section{Spell Descriptions}

The description of each spell lists its specific effects, range,
duration, and other attributes.  Each spell is fully described under
the College to which it belongs. The following information is
included:

\begin{Description}

\item[Rank Modifications] Often range, duration and other effects will
  be given as “x + y / Rank”. This means that the characteristic is
  equal to x, with an additional y for each Rank attained in the
  magic.  Unless otherwise noted, the unit of measurement is the same
  for x \& y. If an increase of y is noted for each n Ranks, then
  partial multiples of n do not count unless specifically stated.

\item[Range] The maximum radius (in feet) within which the Mage can
  make the spell take effect.  This is always the distance from the
  Adept.  It can be a linear measurement between Adept and target, or
  a radius of effect.  Unless explicitly stated, magical effects will
  not occur beyond the range of the magic.  In combat, measurements
  are taken from the middle of a hex, and rounded upwards.

\item[Duration] The maximum length of time that the spell remains in
  effect. Spells with a concentration component will stop as soon as
  concentration is broken.  Spells that do not require concentration
  will persist regardless of the suffering of the Mage, even unto
  death. If a spell is cast in the middle of a pulse, that pulse
  counts towards its duration.

\item[Experience Multiple] The multiple used in conjunction with the
  rank to be achieved to determine the experience cost of increasing a
  Mage’s Rank with a particular spell.

\item[Base Chance] The base percentage chance of succeeding in casting
  a spell.  This may be equal to some multiple of a characteristic of
  the Adept. The characteristic is taken at its current value,
  multiplied appropriately, and then other modifiers are added.

\item[Resistance] The Magic Resistances (Passive and Active) which may
  be applied against the spell by its targets.

\item[Storage] The valid ways that the spell may be stored, for
  example, investment, potion and ward.

\item[Target] Spells and Rituals are targeted at either an Area,
  Object or Entity.  Some spells can be cast at more than one target
  type. If a multi-target or area effect spell is actively resisted,
  the highest Active Resistance of those to be affected is applied.
  Area effect spells are resisted each time that an entity encounters
  them.  Animated objects count as objects and entities.

\item[Effects] The general purpose and consequences of the spell.
  Includes potential damage, effects of resistance, special effects,
  and any exceptions to the normal workings of magic.

\item[Difficulty Factor] A difficulty factor will sometimes be given
  to avoid a spell.  This is always a number by which the stated
  characteristic of the target is multiplied, before modifiers are
  added.

\subsection{Interpretations}

Most of the magic in DQ is designed to be flexible in application, and
up to the interpretation of the GM within the guidelines laid down by
the Gods.  The effects and procedures are meant to apply to humanoid
entities of human size.  An Incinerate Spell that would fry a human
would do little more than discomfort a Dragon. To close every loophole
and explain every application would be impossible.  Therefore, these
matters of interpretation have been left to your GM, in the context of
their game and the atmosphere that they are trying to promote.


\section{Storage and Entrapment of Magic}

There are various methods of storing magical effects.  Each has
different properties and can store different types of spells.

\begin{Description}

\item[Potion] Spells, Talents and some quasi-magical skills (e.g.
  Healer) can be potioned by an Alchemist.  For Talents, the imbiber
  receives the usage of the talent for a duration dependent on the
  Rank (see §30).  For skills, see the skill involved.  For spells,
  imbibing a potioned spell is equivalent to being the Adept and
  casting the spell on oneself.  This is normally the only way for
  self-only spells to be stored.  Target area and target object spells
  cannot be potioned, but spells that affect entities may (possibly)
  be potionable, for example, Necrosis could be potioned, but drinking
  the potion would only cause the imbiber to have their internal
  organs ruptured.  Potions always work, but they cannot double or
  triple effect.

\item[Investment] Spells effects can often be stored in items and at a
  later stage, be triggered.  When a spell is triggered, it is as if
  the Adept was there and had just cast the spell (except the spell
  characteris- tics such as base chance, range, etc, are fixed at the
  time of investment). The entity triggering the spell gets to choose
  the target(s) of the spell at the time of triggering and maintain
  concentration spells.

\item[Ward] A ward is a way of storing a spell within an object, area
  or volume so that when some simple condition is met, the ward is
  triggered, and the entities or objects that fulfilled the condition
  becomes the target for the spell.  When a ward is triggered, it is
  always successful, but cannot cause a multiple effect. For a spell
  to be wardable, it must have a range or area component (the range
  may not be touch, nor self). Wards cannot maintain concentration
  spells.

\item[Magical Trap] Magical effects can be stored in mechanician
  traps.  Unlike wards, traps have to be physically triggered.  The
  spell effect, unless an area effect, will only be targeted on the
  triggerer.  Magical traps can only store spells that have a non-self
  range.  The spell in a trap can only target an area or the
  triggerer.  Spells in traps will always work, but cannot multiple
  effect.

\item[Shaped Magic] Magical items beyond those containing simple
  invested spells are known as shaped items. Shaped items come in two
  flavours, charged and permanent.  Charged items have a number of
  charges which diminishes with use.  Certain items are said to have
  “bound charges”, which means they behave as an invested item except
  they can be recharged.  Charged items which cannot be recharged lose
  their magical status once all charges have been expended.  Permanent
  shaped items can come in any shape or form and can defy many of the
  usual “rules” of the magical universe.
