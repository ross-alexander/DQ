\subsection{Special Notes for Weapons}

 

Weapons  are  normally  wielded  one-handed,  and 
the  exceptions are  noted  with  a  (2)  after  the  name 
of  the  weapon.  Some  may  be  used  either  one  or 
two-handed,  and  these  are  noted  with  a  (1–2). 
When  weapons  of  this  type  are  wielded  two 
handed, increase their Damage Modifier by 1. 

- indicates that a weapon has no Class for purposes of Grievous
Injuries; when a possible Grievous Injury is rolled, only damage
affecting Endurance results.

V indicates that the characteristic is variable. 

A When attacking a foe whose modified AG is between 12 and 9
(inclusive) the weapon may be used to attack twice in one pulse
without penalty; if the modified AG is 8 or less, the weapon may
attack three times in a pulse.

B Only giants can use giant weapons. 

C A torch is not actually a weapon, but may be used as such in
emergencies.  Also, brandishing a burning torch in the face of an
animal may cause it to flee. Any animal whose WP is 10 or less may be
scared off if it fails a roll of 4 × WP.  A successful roll indicates
the animal is not impressed. No Rank may ever be achieved with a
torch.

D The sap may only be used to knock out targets wearing only leather,
cloth or no armour. Used by an assassin, any hit knocks out the
target; for anyone else, any hit stuns and 4 or more points of
effective damage knocks out the target.  This will not work on targets
larger than human size.

E The following weapons also function as thrown weapons: dagger, hand
axe, battle axe, giant axe, crude club, war club, giant club, mace,
war hammer, javelin, spear, giant spear, net, bola and rock.

F Up to three throwing darts may be thrown at one, 
two, or three targets in one action with no penalty. 

G A boomerang returns to the thrower if it does not 
hit anything during its flight. 

H  A  grenado  is  filled  with  any  substance  (manu-
factured  by  an  alchemist)  designed  to  burst  into 
flames  on  impact.  These  substances  include  greek 
fire, methane, and anything else the GM will allow. 
It  bursts  on  landing  (it  need  not  be  thrown  at  a 
particular figure), and its effects are determined by 
the substance contained within. If a “miss” is rolled 
for  the  strike  check,  the  GM  should  randomly 
determine  whether  the  grenado  landed  short,  long, 
left,  or  right  of  the  target  (or  any  combination 
thereof).

I A javelin functions as a thrown weapon unless it is launched by a
spear thrower, in which case the spear thrower’s characteristics are
used and it functions as a missile weapon.

J A pike may be used to melee attack any figure within two hexes; its
melee zone extends into what would normally be the first hexes of the
figure’s ranged zone.

K A lance may be used only by a mounted figure. 

L All missile weapons must be loaded before firing; this action is
in addition to preparing the weapon itself. A pass action must be
taken in order to load the sling, any draw bow, the spear thrower, and
the blowgun.  Two consecutive pass actions must be taken to load a
crossbow (three if using a cranequin).

M Longbows may not be used while mounted, nor by small figures,
including Dwarves \& Halflings.

N An entangling weapon may be used as a garotte in Close Combat.

O The whip may be used to entangle and do damage in the same pulse
to the same target in melee combat.  In close combat, it functions as
a garotte.  Once the target is entangled, the attacker may choose to
leave them entangled (thus letting go of the whip), or disentangle the
target themselves, and retain possession of the weapon.

P Cesti are worn on the hands and need not be prepared in order to be
used.

Q The garotte is used to strangle the target and may only be used
against human-sized or smaller victims.  When used by a trained
assassin, once a successful hit has been scored, it will continue to
do damage every pulse from then on until the victim is dead or the
assassin has taken effective damage from either the victim or an
outside source.  If the victim’s PS is greater than the assassin’s the
GM may permit them to attempt to break the hold, similar to the
attempt to restrain.  If the attempt is successful, the hold is broken
and the assassin will have to make another successful strike check to
continue the strangulation.  Some types of plate armour may, at the
GM’s discretion, prevent the successful use of this weapon due to
protection around the neck area.  A non-assassin has to roll a strike
check every pulse to see if any damage can be done.

R Unarmed has a base chance of 2 × AG + PS over 15. The damage
modifier is -4 (+ 1 for every 3 full points of PS over 15).

S All shot, darts, arrows, and quarrels come in appropriate pouches or
quivers of 20; the weight and cost of the pouch or quiver is not
included in the information given for the accessory.

T A cranequin is used to cock crossbows; it re- quires a PS of 11 and
two free hands.

U If a blowgun dart does any effective damage, the damage is not
scored against their victim but rather they suffer the effects of the
substance which coats the tip (poison, for instance; see Alchemist
§30).

\end{tabularx}

Weight The weight of the shield in pounds. 
 
Defence / Rank The percentage by which the figure’s defence is
increased per Rank while the shield is prepared (Rank 0 is counted as
a Rank†).
 
Manual Dexterity Loss The number of points the figure’s MD is reduced
by for all purposes while that shield is prepared.

 
Cost The cost in Silver Pennies for a shield of average workmanship.
 

When a shield is not prepared, it is considered slung on the back of
the figure carrying it.  All shields except the tower shield and main
gauche are constructed of wood and hides and do not affect the flow of
mana in regard to Adepts.

†The main gauche does not subtract its defence from any fire attack,
and cannot make a shield rush attack. The main gauche functions both
as a weapon and a shield, and only one EP expenditure is used to rise
in Rank in both.  No defence bonus is gained at Rank 0.

Weight The number by which a figure’s size is multiplied to find the
weight of the armour in pounds. Size number for the character races
are: Halfling (3), Dwarf (4), Elf (5), Orc (6), Human (6), Hill Giant
(9). For all others, the multiple is their height in feet (round up).
Females should subtract 0.5 from the multiples.

Protection The number of Damage Points the armour absorbs.

Agility Loss The number of points the figure’s AG is reduced for all
purposes when the armour is worn. Does not include possible additional
AG loss for the weight of the armour.

Cost The cost in Silver Pennies for the armour.  Costs assumes average
workmanship and mansized armour; larger or smaller armour should
cost proportionally more or less.

Stealth Adjustment The amount by which a figure wearing that type of
armour has their stealth percentage adjusted.

Note Cloth armour is worn underneath all other armours and its
protection and weight are fac- tored into those armours.

1.  Silvered Armour has the same protection – cost is + 30,000 sp.
Permits magic at -10\% to Base Chance.

2.  Truesilvered Armour has the same protection – cost is + 180,000
sp. Permits magic at no modification to Base Chance.

3. Bronze Armour has 2 points less protection – cost is the same.
Permits magic at no modification to Base Chance.
