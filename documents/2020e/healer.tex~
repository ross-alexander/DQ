\begin{Chapter}{Healer (Ver 1.4)}

The  healer  skill  is  pseudo-magical  and healers  are 
able to cure all physical ills and perform miracles. 
It is a highly skilled profession and healers are not 
common.  However  their  existence  means  the 
health and life span of people in the DQ world are 
considerably  better  than  their  medieval  counter-
parts. 

A healer’s empathy often gives them a distaste for 
causing pain to others. 

A  healer  will  charge  whatever  their  client  can 
afford for their lower Ranked abilities. The charge 
for a miracle (the performance of an ability Rank 8 
or  greater)  will  normally  exceed  2000  Silver  Pen-
nies. 

For  the  purposes  of  the  Healer  skill,  an  entity’s 
body parts are the head, torso, and each limb. Vital 
Organs are the heart, stomach, viscera (liver, small 
and  large  intestines  and  kidneys),  genitalia,  brain, 
and eyes. 

A  healer  may  also  use  their  abilities  upon  animals 
which  they  have  Beastmaster  (§35)  familiarity. 
However non-sentients cannot be resurrected. 

The  section  §4  Health  and  Fitness  details  the  ef-
fects of injury and illness on patients. 

Field Operations 

Once  a healer  begins  work  on  curing  a patient  the 
condition  of  the  patient  is  “stabilised”  while  that 
curing is continuing. This means that no Endurance 
or  Fatigue  loss  will  occur  for  the  condition  that  is 
being  cured.  Other  afflictions  will  be  unaffected. 
After  each  healing  attempt  a  pulse  effectively 
passes prior to any other attempt beginning. 

Potions & Unconscious Patients 

An entity cannot drink a healing potion when they 
are  unconscious  or  below  zero  endurance  but  one 
can be massaged down their throat. The chance of 
doing  this  is  equal  to  the Manual  Dexterity  +  Per-
ception of the person administering the potion, or if 
a healer, 90 + Healer Rank. If successful then D10 
per 10 points of the healing potion’s curing (round 
down) will be received. If the person fails the roll, 
the  potion  is  wasted,  but  no  harmful  effects  occur 
to the patient.

8. 
9. 
10.  Regenerate Trunk, Head and Vital Organs 
NB.  A  healer  must  choose  at  Rank  0  whether  or 
not to learn Ranged Empathy. 

37.2 Restrictions 
A  healer  must  expend  as  many  Fatigue  Points  as 
the Rank at which they acquired the ability they are 
using (except Empathy, Ranged Empathy). 

A  healer  may  use  any  of  their  abilities  (with  the 
exception of resurrection) upon themselves. 

A  healer  must  “lay  hands”  (place  their  hands)  on 
an  entity  on  whom  they  are  to  use  any  of  their 
abilities (except Ranged Empathy). 

A  healer  has  the  following  modifications  to  their 
combat strike chances: 

Tactile Empathy (only): 

-1 / 2 Ranks  Close Combat strike chance 
-1 / 5 Ranks  Melee Combat strike chance 

37 HEALER 

Time: 5 seconds 
A  healer  may  neutralise  the  effects  of  a  natural 
venom or  the  effects  of  a  synthetic  poison  created 
by  an  alchemist  of  equal  or  lesser  Rank.  If  a  syn-
thetic poison is produced by an alchemist of greater 
Rank  they  must  roll  the  second  Base  Chance 
above. 

Cure Burns and Repair Scars 

Base Chance: 90 + Rank 
Time: 30 minutes - 2 / Rank 
A  healer  may  immediately  halt  ongoing  burning 
damage,  and  prevent  scarring  from  a  fresh  burn. 
They  may  also  reduce  the  effects  of  old  scars; 
minor scars can be completely removed, but major 
scars  would  take  (2  ×  PB  Modifier)  successful 
cures to be removed. 

Repair Damage 

Base Chance: 90 + Rank 
Time: 50 hours - 3 / Rank 
A  healer  may  repair  torn,  damaged,  or  broken 
muscles, bone, tissues and organs. Generally these 
abilities will be used to repair the effects of Griev-
ous Injuries. 

A Healer may repair all injuries to one body part at 
the same time. To use Repair, a body part must be 
mostly  intact  and  no  more  than  half  damaged. 
Regeneration is required for more significant heal-
ing. 

A healer can act as a cosmetic surgeon. First, they 
sedate  their  patient  with  the  soothe  pain  ability. 
They then slice and reshape the skin, muscles, and 
bones which are deemed unsightly, and make them 
whole  with  the  appropriate  repair  ability.  Unless 
the  healer  has  also  learnt  regeneration,  it  is  best 
that they work with a partner. 

Preserve Dead 

Base Chance: 90 + Rank 
Time: 60 minutes - 5 / Rank 
A healer can suspend the time limit on resurrection 
by preserving the dead body of a being. Each time 
a  healer  uses  the  preserve  dead  ability,  the  body 
will  not  “age”  for  a  number  of  days  equal  to  the 
healer’s Rank. This ability may be repeated by the 
same healer on the same body. 

Reattach Body Parts 

Base Chance: 90 + Rank 
Time: 30 minutes - 2 / Rank 
A  Healer  able  to  Repair  Muscle  may  reattach  a 
severed  body  part.  The  reattached  body  part  may 
be  Repaired  to  full  functionality  provided  the 
wound meets the requirements of repair and it was 
severed for no more than Rank minutes. Or it may 
be Regenerated to full functionality provided it was 
severed for no more than Rank hours. 

Resurrection 

Time: 60 minutes - 5 / Rank 
Base Chance: Patient’s Endurance + 8 / Rank  
minimum = Rank  
maximum = 90 + Rank  
regardless of the total modifiers.

37.3 Ability Descriptions 

Empathy 

Base Chance: automatic 
Time: 5 seconds 
When  a  healer  lays  on  hands  they  immediately 
invoke empathy. 

A  healer  uses  empathy  to  identify  which  of  the 
healing abilities is required to heal the patient. 

The  healer  automatically  detects  the  surface  emo-
tions of the entity being healed. An entity’s surface 
emotions  are  those  which  currently  occupy  their 
conscious mind. The GM informs the healer of the 
general feelings of the being with which they have 
empathy. 

Ranged Empathy 

Base Chance: Perception + 10 / Rank 
Time: 5 seconds 
If  the  healer  has  learnt  Ranged  empathy  they  may 
attempt to detect the surface emotions of an entity 
no more than (2 × Rank) feet away from them at a 
cost of 1 Fatigue Point. If the entity actively resists 
then  subtract  twice  the  target’s  Willpower  from 
this success chance. 

Cure Infection, Disease, Headaches and 
Fever 

Base Chance: 15 × Rank + Patient’s Endurance 
Time: 30 minutes - 2 / Rank 
A  healer  neutralises  poisons  and  cures  fevers  and 
diseases  in  much  the  same  manner  that  medicines 
and antidotes (see §30.2) do. 

If  the  healing  attempt  is  unsuccessful  the  patient 
subtracts  10  from  their  next  die  roll  to  see  if  they 
naturally recover from their affliction. 

Soothe Pain 

Base Chance: 90 + Rank  
Time: 60 seconds - 5 / Rank 
Duration: Rank squared hours 
When  a  healer  uses  their  soothe  pain  ability,  they 
numb their patient’s nervous system so that it will 
not  transmit  pain  sensations  to  their  brain.  The 
ability  also  has  a  soporific  effect upon the patient, 
so  that  they  will  not  inadvertently  injure  them-
selves  while  unable  to  distinguish  hurtful  actions. 
The GM may, at their discretion, permit the healer 
to use this ability as if they had fed or injected their 
patient with a local or general anaesthetic, tranquil-
liser, etc. 

Prolong Life 

Base Chance: 90 + Rank 
Time: 60 seconds - 5 / Rank 
When a healer uses the prolong life ability add D10 
×  (Healer’s  Rank  +  Patient’s  Endurance)  days  to 
the life of their patient. A patient’s life may not be 
prolonged to over three times their natural life. An 
entity  with  a  prolonged  life  has  a  reduced  chance 
of resurrection. 

Heal Endurance and Transfer Fatigue 

Base Chance: 90 + Rank 
Time: 11 minutes - 1 / Rank 
Heal Endurance will cure the patient of [D + Rank 
-  5]  Endurance  points.  It  will  not  heal  damage 
associated with a specific grievous injury. 

When  a  healer  transfers  fatigue  the  patient  gains 
one Fatigue point for each point the healer expends 
(above the fatigue cost to use the ability). 

An entity may never have more  Fatigue or Endur-
ance  Points  than  the  value  of  the  relevant  charac-
teristic and excess points cured have no effect upon 
the patient. 

Neutralise Poison 

Base  Chance:  90  +  Rank  (natural)  or  50  -  5  × 
difference in Rank (synthetic) 

113

patient  been  alive.  For  example,  poison  and  non-
specific wounds will be cured automatically. 

If the resurrection is successful, the patient is resur-
rected  with  their  body  whole.  Their  Endurance 
characteristic  is  decreased  by  one,  although  all  of 
their  other  characteristics  remain  as  before  they 
died. 

After a resurrection the patient will have 1 Endur-
ance point and 0 Fatigue. The Endurance is consid-
ered to be grievous damage and the Fatigue loss is 
deemed to be due to tiredness. This means that the 
Fatigue  loss may  only  be  recovered  by  sleep,  rest, 
hot meals or some form of fatigue transfer and the 
Endurance loss may be cured by a healer, magic, or 
by letting the body heal itself naturally. 

If the resurrection is unsuccessful the patient is not 
resurrected  and  their  Endurance  characteristic  is 
decreased  by  one.  The  body  is  preserved  for  one 
full day after the attempt. When an entity’s Endur-
ance is  reduced  to  zero  or  less,  that entity  may  no 
longer be resurrected. 

If the roll for resurrection is equal to or greater than 
(90 + Rank), the healer has summoned a malignant 
spirit, rather than the patient’s life-force. The spirit 
will  drain the healer’s  Endurance  characteristic  by 
[D  -  5].  The  spirit  will  then  return  to  the  nether-
world. 

Restrictions: 

1.  A  healer  may  attempt  the  resurrection  of  an 
entity who is less than 10 × Rank hours dead. 

2. A healer must have a body part at least the size 
of a torso to attempt the resurrection of an entity. A 
37.5 Healer Summary Chart 

healer will not succeed if they attempt the resurrec-
tion  of  a  living  being  from  a  severed  body  part 
(there  is  only  one  life  force).  If  a  body  is  com-
pletely destroyed (perhaps burned), which prevents 
the  resurrection  of  the  entity,  the  entity  may  be-
come a revenant. 

3.  If  the  patient  has  wounds that  require  regenera-
tion (Rank 9 or 10) healing, these need to be healed 
separately. 

4. Most vital organs will need to be healed prior to 
the  resurrection  otherwise  the  body  will  die  again 
immediately  (the  notable  exception  being  the 
eyes). 

5.  The  healer  need  not  know  what  the  patient 
looked  like  since  the  healing  of  the  body  is  gov-
erned  by  its  own  characteristics.  Hence  any 
changes that had been made to the body (for exam-
ple  facial  changes  or  embedding  of  items)  will  be 
gone after the resurrection. 

6.  A  player  may  take  no  action  with  their  charac-
ter’s dead body. 

7.  In  rare  instances  a  healer  may  be  able  to  resur-
rect  a  life  force  into  a  different  body.  The  resur-
rected entity has the physical characteristics of the 
new  body  and  the  mental  characteristics  from  the 
life force. It will take some months for the entity to 
get  used  to  the  new  body  and  this  will  affect  base 
chances  of  physical  abilities.  The  GM  will  advise 
the specifics. 

8.  A  body  that  has  been  animated  (e.g.  Zombie) 
may  still  be  resurrected  provided  it  is  no  longer 
animated  and  all  the  other  conditions  have  been 

met  (for  example  length  of  death,  condition,  etc.). 
Note that the Healer Preserve Dead will not affect 
Zombies. 

Regeneration 

Base Chance: 90 + Rank 
Time: 50 hours - 3 / Rank (refer below) 
A healer can regenerate every portion of an entity’s 
body  including  vital  organs  and  severely  damaged 
or  severed  body  parts.  A  healer  must  regenerate 
each vital organ or body part separately. 

Regeneration  will  regenerate  [Healer  Rank]  per-
cent  of  a  missing  body  part  or  vital  organ  per  day 
costing  the  target  [Healer  Rank]  FT  per  day.  A 
Healer  must  initiate  the  Regeneration  of  a  body 
part  or  vital  organ,  the  regeneration will  then con-
tinue  unattended  until  the  regrowth  is  complete  or 
the  healing  area  sustains  further  significant  dam-
age. 

A  regenerated  vital  organ  will  immediately  begin 
to  function  if  enough  of  the  rest  of  the  entity’s 
body  is  in  working  order.  Otherwise,  the  vital 
organ will be dormant until the healer can repair or 
regenerate the necessary body parts. The regenera-
tion  time  does  not  need  to  be  consecutive,  but  the 
damaged part will not function nor continue grow-
ing until the regeneration time is complete. 

37.4 Potions 
A  healer  can  manufacture  certain  potions  in  con-
junction  with  an  alchemist.  See  Alchemist  (§30.2) 
for more details.
