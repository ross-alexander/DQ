\begin{College}[2.1]{bard}{Bardic Magics}{BA}

The College of Bardic Magic deals primarily with sound, language,
rhythm, and the power in music, particularly the power to soothe,
charm, and otherwise affect emotions.  Adepts of this College are
generally known as Bards.  Many Bards are employed as court musicians,
though a number exercise their art as sole practitioners, wandering
the highways and byways of the land.

Almost all Bards have performance skills, often highly ranked.
Alongside this they often have the Spy skill which is complemented by
certain of the magics of this College. It is not unknown for Bards to
pass themselves off as simple musicians or entertainers in order to
infiltrate unfriendly courts.  It is this fact, and the consequently
secretive nature of this College, which has lead to its relative
obscurity.

The principal difference between this college and all others is that
the spell’s verbal component is usually sung, instead of spoken.
Furthermore, because a musical instrument may be used to enhance the
effect, Bardic spells have little or no somatic component.  It is
almost impossible for a Bard to cast quietly.

\subsection{Traditional Colours}

Bards usually wear an item of a particular shade of deep blue,
sometimes known as Harper Blue, somewhere on their person. Otherwise
they tend to dress to the occasion.

\subsection{Traditional Symbols}

The symbol of the Bardic College is a golden harp.  This may be worn
as a brooch or amulet or embossed on the Bard’s instrument if
appropriate.

\section{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Bardic Magics can only practise their art in
a region where sound can be heard. It is not possible to practise
Bardic magic in a location where sound is silenced, magically or
otherwise.  Bardic magic may be practised underwater, but the results
may vary somewhat from those expected.

The MA requirement for this College is 16. 

\section{Base Chance Modifiers}

The following numbers are added to the Base Chance of performing any
talent, spell or ritual of the College of Bardic Magics:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={Xr}}
For each Rank of Troubadour (Singing) (This bonus is only applicable when spell is sung)	& +1 \\
Area is acoustically excellent	& +5 \\
Area deadens sound		& −5 \\
\end{dqtblr}

All modifiers are cumulative. 

\section{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Concealed Casting}

\multiple{150}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to conceal the casting of a spell within the words
of a mundane song.  If an observer is listening intently the observer
may make a (2 × PC - Rank) check to notice. The bard may not make any
movements which are inappropriate to the song being sung.  All aspects
of the spell (including Base Chance) must be cast at the lower of this
talent and the spell’s Rank and the Base Chance is further reduced by
20\%. This Talent only functions with spells of the Bardic College.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Enhanced Hearing}

\multiple{75}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to hear sounds too faint to be heard normally.  The
Rank of this talent should be added to the Adept’s perception for the
purposes of detecting sounds only.  This talent can be activated and
deactivated at will, and the Adept may be temporarily deafened by loud
noises while it is activated.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}


\begin{talent}[T-3]{Melodic Memory}

\multiple{75}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can attempt to commit to memory any sounds that they can
hear.  The Adept must concentrate to activate this talent, and the
Adept’s player should represent this by taking down key words and
phrases.  By means of this talent the Adept can memorise music,
dramas, dialogue etc.  even if they cannot understand them.  The
Adept’s chance of success to recall the sounds is 2 × PC (+ 5 / Rank)
- 5 / week since the sounds were heard. If the Adept rolls above their
Base Chance the higher the roll the greater the degree of error.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-4]{Project Voice}

\multiple{75}
\begin{effects}
The talent allows the Adept to project their voice so that it may be
heard clearly everywhere within 25 feet (+ 25 / Rank).
\end{effects}
\end{talent}


\section{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Clairaudience}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None }
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates an invisible, intangible ear that can be moved about
within the spell’s range. The ear appears in the same hex as the Bard,
and operates as a normal ear except that it is not physically attached
to the Bard.  The Adept may move the ear at a TMR of up to the Rank of
the spell, taking pass actions to do so. The ear may be detected by
Witchsight or similar means of detection.  If the ear takes any
magical damage (it may be struck by a magical weapon) it is destroyed
and the Adept is stunned.  It cannot be used to target spells.  In the
area of a Confusion of Tongues spell the Adept will only hear
meaningless jumbled words.  Clairaudience will not penetrate the
volume of a Shell of Silence spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Enchant Instrument}

\range{Touch}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Musical Instrument}
\begin{effects}
With this spell the Adept draws on the resonance left in an instrument
from it having been played. The spell enchants one musical instruments
so that a being may play it at an effective Troubadour Rank equal to
0 + (1 / 3 or fraction ranks), whether or not they know how to play
that form of instrument.  This Rank may not exceed the maximum Rank
the instrument being targeted has previously been played at.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Ethereal Orchestra}

\range{25 feet + 25 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
Creates magical accompaniment for the Adept’s performance. The
accompaniment consists of the sounds of one instrument plus one per
three full ranks. The Adept must be familiar with music made by their
chosen instruments, but need not be able to play the instruments
themselves.  This accompaniment increases the effective Rank of the
performance by 1 (+ 1 / 5 Ranks) without bestowing new skills, or
affecting quasi-magical abilities or base chances.  The maximum volume
generated may not exceed that of loud chanting, and the accompaniment
can be heard clearly everywhere within the range of the spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\begin{spell}[G-4]{Exhortation}

\range{25 feet + 25 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
By means of this spell the Adept may attempt to affect the mood of a
crowd, inciting a riot or calming a mob.  The reaction roll of the
crowd is modified by +5\% ( + 1 / Rank). Once the Adept ceases to play
and/or sing, the spell ceases to be in effect, but the effects may
continue as determined by the GM.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Quietness}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The sounds of the target’s movement are partially deadened. The effect
of this is to add 5\% (+ 1 / Rank) to Stealth.  Any Entity attempting
to cast Bardic magic while under the effect of this spell suffers a 5
penalty to their Base Chance due to the deadening of sound.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Mockery}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Sentient Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept sings or orates a song or poem, detailing the target’s
shortcomings and inflicting general abuse, insults and mockery.  A
target that fails to resist may be embarrassed, shocked, humiliated,
indignant or infuriated as appropriate to their personality.  Whatever
the emotional effect, the character is distracted, and may do nothing
other than attempt to silence the Adept (by whatever means they wish)
or take pass actions for the duration of the spell.  A check of 1 × WP
may be made at the end of the pulse following the pulse in which the
spell is cast and every pulse thereafter.  Once the target
successfully makes a check the spell ends.  The target must be able to
hear and understand the Adept in order for the spell to have any
effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Shatter}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept shrieks in an unnatural and piercing fashion, creating
ethereal dissonance that can destroy objects.  The Adept may affect an
object of no more than 0.5 pounds (+ 0.5 / Rank).  Additionally, the
Rank of this spell determines what material may be destroyed:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={m{3em}X}}
Rank	& Material \\
0--3	& glass, mirror \\
4--6	& ceramics \\
7--9	& crystals \\
10--12	& stone \\
13--14	& gems \\
15--16	& bone or ivory \\
17--18  & hard metal (iron) \\
19--20  & soft metal (bronze) \\
\end{dqtblr}

Note that the base MR of objects is 0.  Crafted objects and those made
of precious materials receive bonuses to their resistance rolls, as
detailed below.  Shaped magical items are immune to the effects of
this spell. Possessions have their owners MR.  These bonuses are
cumulative. Crafting modifier: 2 × Artisan Rank; material modifiers:
Silver +5\%, Gold +10\%, Truesilver +15\%, Precious gems, etc.  +20\%.
The GM should only apply the modifier of the material that makes up
the majority of the object.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Silent Sounds}

\range{Touch}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 minutes / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The target object generates sounds which are almost inaudible, but
affect living entities within 5 feet (+ 5 / Rank) rendering them
either edgy and more susceptible to fear and awe, or tranquil and less
prone to fear and awe.  Affected beings either add or subtract 1 (+ 1
/ Rank) to rolls made on the fright or awe tables as appropriate.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9]{Soothe the Savage Beast}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept plays or sings soothing music which causes any living
non-sentient entities within or entering the area of effect to resist
or be pacified.  Animals that do not resist must make a check against
2 × WP - Rank of Spell to attack the Adept, and a check against 2 × WP
to initiate any attack whilst in the area.  The creature’s reaction
roll is increased by 10\% (+ 2 / Rank), but the reaction roll may not
be made to exceed 95 by the effects of this spell.  If any soothed
entity is attacked, or the Adept ceases to play and/or sing, the spell
ceases to be in effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-10]{Speaking Beasts}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Animal}
\begin{effects}
This spell confers any one language known to the Adept at Rank 6 or
greater, upon an animal (beast, avian, or aquatic; any non-sentient
able to vocalise sounds) for the duration of the spell, at a language
Rank equal to 1 (+ 1 / 5 Ranks).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-10]{Ventriloquism}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may project their voice so that it appears to be emanating
from anywhere within the range of the spell.  Also, it may be altered
so that it sounds like any other voice or voices the Adept has heard
and memorised with the Melodic Memory talent.  For every five complete
ranks the Adept can project an extra simultaneous and independent
voice.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\section{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Implanting Sounds}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{1  week  +  1  /  Rank;  Permanent  at  Rank 20} 
\multiple{250}
\basechance{20\% + 4\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Object or Area}
\casttime{1 hour}
\actions{Perform song or sounds}
\concentration{None}
\begin{effects}
This ritual creates a type of ward, implanting a sequence of sounds
(which may be words, spoken or sung) of up to 10 seconds (+ 10 / Rank)
duration into an object or area.  The Adept may determine the
triggering conditions, in the same way as a ward. Additionally, sounds
implanted into an object may have a range of “Touch” thus being
triggered by a tactile cue, usually simply the object being touched.
The sound will be emitted each time the triggering conditions are met,
up to a maximum of 1 (+ 1 / Rank) times.  The volume of the sound
produced may not exceed that of loud ringing bells. The ritual
dissipates at the end of its duration or if the Bardic General
Knowledge counterspell is cast on the target.  If the ritual
backfires, the sounds are triggered immediately and will repeat Rank
times, or until counterspelled.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-2]{Recitation}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\% + 4\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Object, Area or Entity}
\casttime{1 hour}
\actions{None}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
At the completion of this ritual the Adept will enter a trance, during
which they will recite a legend or story relating to their current
location, to an object held in their hands, or to an entity they are
touching.  If no such story exists, or the ritual fails, then the
Adept will recite some amusing but trivial song.  If the ritual
backfires the legend will be false.  The amount of information
received is related to the Bard’s Rank with this ritual.  If the GM
prefers this may be played as obtaining an answer to 3 (+1/3 ranks)
short questions related to the location, object or entity which will
be answered in “legendary” terms.  This ritual may not be repeated on
a given target more than once per season.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}


\section{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Charming}

\range{50 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can influence the actions of an entity who fails to resist,
provided that the target can hear and understand the Adept. The target
will see the Adept as their true friend and will readily accept most
suggestions emanating from them.  Sworn enemies of the Adept (or of
their race) will not be affected by this spell. Any suggestion that is
not directly and obviously inimical to the target’s interests (as
defined by the GM, but usually limited to actions that would be
injurious or fatal) will be acted upon 90\% of the time.  The Adept
may only ensure 100\% compliance with a request by making it an order
in which case the target makes an im- mediate Resistance Check.  Any
suggestion that would lead to the target’s injury or death results in
an immediate Resistance Check.  If successful the spell is broken.
Otherwise, the target accepts the order and will carry it out
faithfully for the duration of the spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Compel Speech}

\range{Touch}
\duration{1 minute + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target entity must resist, or be compelled to speak continuously
on random subjects.  Should anyone put a question to the entity they
must make a 3 × (WP - Spell Rank) check or speak to the question.  The
entity is not compelled to speak the truth by this spell, or any
particular language, and may cast spells.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Comprehending Tongues}

\range{Self}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
Enables the Adept to speak and understand one language at a Rank equal
to 1 (+ 1 / 4 Ranks).  The Adept must have heard the language that
they wish to speak. The language may be nominated by name, or by
choosing to speak a language that the Adept has memorised some words
and phrases from using the Talent of Melodic Memory.  This spell
allows the Adept to be understood, but confers no other bonuses.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Confusion of Tongues}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
All entities within the radius of effect of the spell who fail to
resist become unable to communicate in or understand any verbal
language whilst within the affected area. The affected area is a
circle with a radius of 5 feet (+ 5 / Rank).  Affected entities may
not use the Military Scientist “time out” ability. They can cast
spells and trigger items, but if casting, the backfire threshold (i.e.
+30 or +40) is decreased by 5\% (+ 1 / Rank).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Dance of Swords}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
While under the effect of this spell, the target may cavort and leap
with surpassing grace and extravagance by evoking the magic of the
dance.  The target may walk and act in all ways normally, however,
when they enter combat they may “dance” adding 2 (+2 / Rank) to their
Defence provided they move at least 1 hex each pulse. If the target is
unwillingly confined to a single hex (by the effect of melee zones for
example) the target must halve the defence bonus due to this spell.
If the target is unable to move freely (in close combat or stunned)
then no defence bonus is awarded. The target may also subtract the
Rank of this spell from the dice roll for any AG Check solely
involving Agility (e.g. avoid knockdown, leaping pits etc.).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Enthralling Audience}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Invested, Ward}
\target{Sentient living entities}
\begin{effects}
All entities who willingly listen to the song sung by the Adept will
perceive a succession of evocative images which illustrate the song
being sung.  These images are hallucinatory in nature, having no
external reality, but are seen by the audience. No resistance check
needs to be made by those who do not submit willingly to the effects
of the spell, but they will not perceive the images.

Those who submit to the effects will be enthralled by the images and
may take no other action, unless and until their concentration is
broken by physical contact with an external entity or force. The Adept
must continue to sing throughout the duration.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Shout of Thunder}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept projects a thunderous shout of rage at the target. If the
target fails to resist it suffers [D - 5] (+ 1 / Rank) damage and is
automatically stunned.  The target will also be deafened for [D - 5]
(+ 1 / 2 Ranks) minutes and will have a very nasty headache which will
make concentration one level more difficult until it wears off or is
cured by a healer. There is a chance equal to 5\% + 1 / Rank that this
deafness will be permanent until cured by the arts of a Healer of Rank
4 or greater, or by the Ritual of Cure Deafness and Muteness.  The
sound is clearly audible in the area surround-ing the target.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Inspirational Song}

\range{15 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{20 seconds + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Sentient Entities}
\begin{effects}
The Adept sings a song of inspiration mentioning the name of each
target.  The spell will affect 1 target (+ 1/3 or fraction Ranks) who
each gain 1 (+ 1/2 Ranks) to their Strike Chances, and 1 (+ 1 / Rank)
to Fear Resistance rolls and Rally Chances.  Targets must be able to
hear and understand the Bard.  The Adept must sing or orate for the
entire duration of the spell, or the effect ceases.  The Adept may
perform other actions as long as they have no vocal requirement.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Satyr’s Dance}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration:  Maximum  10  seconds  +10 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept sings and dances in a hypnotic pattern, entrancing all in
range who fail to resist, and forcing them to join in the dance.  All
dancers (including the Adept) may move at 1/2 TMR (round up), but are
unable to take any other action.  The area of effect moves with the
Adept and all victims will attempt to stay within range.  Any entity
that enters the area of effect must resist or suffer the same fate.
The Adept must be seen and heard for a target to be effected.  Victims
of this song get an additional resistance roll every pulse that they
are attacked or restrained, or somehow prevented from being within the
area of effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Shell of Silence}

\range{10 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates an invisible spherical shell with a diameter equal
to 15 feet (+ 5 feet for every 5 Ranks).  Sound created within this
shell is totally inaudible to entities outside the shell and vice
versa.  A Clairaudience spell projected from outside the shell cannot
penetrate it.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Silver Tongue}

\range{Self}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
Everything that the Adept says becomes more convincing and believable.
This ability does not force listeners to believe the Adept, and
obvious lies where there is evidence to the contrary will be quickly
dismissed.  But in the absence of such evidence, or when the lie is
not blatant, listeners will tend to take the Adept at their word. All
natural or magical abilities that are normally able to determine
whether the Adept is lying or telling the truth suffer a negative
modifier to their Base Chance of 20\% (+ 5 / Rank).  Those abilities
that always work or have no BC may be presumed to have a BC of 100\%
for these purposes. In addition, no magical ability is able to coerce
the Adept to speak truthfully.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-12]{Siren Song}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{None}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
All entities within the range of the spell and able to hear the Adept,
must resist or feel a sudden affection for the Adept.  They will then
be unable to carry out any action that might harm the Adept. However,
if the Adept carries out any hostile action towards an entity or the
entity is rendered no longer able to hear, that entity will be
released from the spell.  The Adept must continue to sing for the
duration or the spell ceases to be in effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-13]{Slumber Song}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Until waking}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept plays a song that affects one willing entity (+ 1 / 3 or
fraction ranks) causing them to drift into a normal sleep.  All
affected targets fall asleep in 4 minutes (10 seconds / Rank, minimum
of 30 seconds).  The targets will remain asleep until disturbed or
they awaken normally.  The resulting sleep is healing and refreshing
allowing the targets to regain 1 (+ 1 / 5 full Ranks) more FT per
hour while under its effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-14]{Whispering World}

\range{100 miles + 100 / Rank}

\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept whispers a message consisting of no more than 5 words (+ 5 /
Rank). The message travels to the recipient, who must be known to the
Adept, taking D10 + (distance travelled / 100) hours.  The recipient’s
surroundings (such as trees, waves or wind) whisper the message to the
recipient.  There is a once times perception chance that any Bard
engaged in concentration will “overhear” a whisper which passes by
their location.

gongs.  The enchanted instrument can be heard at its normal volume
(usually loud) throughout an area with a radius equal to 1 mile (+ 1 /
Rank).  The effect may be made permanent if the Adept chooses to
permanently expend a point of Endurance.  If the ritual backfires the
instrument will be destroyed in addition to the normal backfire
effect.

\begin{effects}
The Adept marches around the structure, within earshot of the walls,
playing a musical instrument.  The music must be able to be clearly
heard at the structure.  The size of structure which may be
encompassed is 50 feet (+ 50 / Rank) in diameter.  The structure
begins to shake and vibrate, and at the end of the ritual, if it is
successful, the structure falls apart.  The Adept must walk slowly (1
mph) around the target until they have completely encircled the target
at least once, and have marched for at least an hour.

\begin{ritual}[R-4]{The Piper’s Song}

\range{30 feet + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{MA + 3\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Self}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{Instrument (usually pipe)}
\actions{Playing instrument and walking}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
The Adept nominates one type of nonsentient entity which normally
forms swarms, packs or herds (e.g.  rats, locusts, wolves, elephants)
at the start of this ritual.  The size of the entity which can be
affected is dependent on Rank:
\begin{Description}
\item[Rank 0--5] entities less than 1lb in weight can be affected;
\item[Rank 6--10] entities less than 10lb;
\item[Rank 11--15] entities less than 100 lb;
\item[Rank 16 and above] entities greater than 100lb.
\end{Description}

The Adept then begins to play a tune which has a compelling effect on
all entities of the target type. The area of effect moves with the
Adept, and as they play and walk, all of these entities within range
will begin to follow the Adept, growing into a horde.  At the end of
at least 1 hour the Adept gives a single command to the horde.  The
wording of this command may not exceed 1 word (+ 1/3 or fraction
Ranks).  The command will be obeyed for a period of 1 hour (+1 /
Rank).
