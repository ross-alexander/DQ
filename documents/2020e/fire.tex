\begin{College}[2.0]{fire}{Fire Magics}{FI}

The College of Fire Magics is concerned exclusively with manipulating
the element of fire.  Adepts of this College are referred to as Fire
Mages or Pyromancers.

Within range low level heat sources (such as living bodies) can be
seen. At double range medium level sources (such as camp fires) are
visible and high level heat sources may be visible at any range.

The affinity fire mages have for their element has often led to them
being considered to be pyromaniacs.  Most fire mages, however, have a
healthy respect for fire, and rarely will they wantonly set people or
places alight. They do enjoy being in or near fire and are generally
the first to suggest a nice camp fire when adventuring.  Fire mages
are also thought to be hot-tempered, to enjoy hot and spicy food, and
to dislike getting wet.  They frequently have red hair.  Generally
fire mages are flamboyant characters, particularly in their
spellcasting. The College of Fire Magics is anything but subtle, and
its spells involve more than the usual amounts of shouting and arm
waving.

The element of fire is unquestionably destructive, and as a
consequence the majority of the spells of this college cause
considerable amount of damage, if only as a side-effect.  The Fire
College is not noted for being harmless, and so fire mages are even
less popular than most mages among the common folk. When it is
revealed that a person is an Adept of the Fire College the usual
reaction will generally be one of fear and trepidation.  Fire mages
are quite amicable towards the Adepts of other colleges with the
notable exception of those of the College of Water Magics.

Unless otherwise specified, Magical Fire will automatically ignite
flammables.

\subsection{Traditional colours}

Fire mages generally prefer to wear red, the colour of their element,
often trimmed with black, yellow or orange.  For jewellery the fire
mage most frequently chooses garnets or rubies, set in gold.

\subsection{Traditional symbols}

The symbol of the Fire College is the flame, usually depicted in red
or gold.

\section{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Fire Magics may only practice their arts in
an area where it is possible for fire to exist.  They may not practice
fire magic underwater or in a vacuum, for example.

The MA requirement for this college is 12. 

\section{Base Chance Modifiers}

The Base Chance of performing any talent, spell or ritual of the
College of Fire Magics is modified by addition of the following
numbers:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={Xr}}
Adept is in light mist, fog, or rain, or is soaking wet & -5 \\
Adept is in heavy fog, or rain, or is partially immersed in water & -10 \\
Adept is almost totally immersed in water & -15 \\
Adept is within 30 feet of large campfire & +5 \\
Adept is within 30 feet of bonfire  & +10 \\
Adept is in contact with small campfire & +5 \\
Adept is in contact with large campfire  & +10 \\
Adept is in contact with bonfire  & +15 \\
Adept is in a hot, dry region (e.g. desert) & +5 \\
\end{dqtblr}

Only one modifier from each group may be applied together. These
bonuses only apply to normal fire.  Magical fire may only be used to
reduce negative modifiers to zero.

\section{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Infravision}

\range{50 feet + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\resist{None}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to see heat sources as if they emit normal light and
target them (e.g.  with weapons or spells) in the absence of visible
light. It works best in relative darkness, since it is easily
over-powered by visible light.

This talent can sometimes penetrate where normal vision cannot. At
half normal range the Adept can see heat sources which are warmer than
the ob- scurement, eg.  living entities through mist or light bushes.
It may also possible to detect the residual heat of a source which has
recently been moved or extinguished.

The Adept has a base chance of PC (+ 5 / Rank) - 1 / 10 feet between
the Adept and the heat source (after the first 10) of gaining
additional information about a particular heat source. They may:

1. Determine the relative temperature of the heat source.

2. Identify the general type of heat source.  Only those heat sources
that the Adept has previously encountered may be identified with this
talent.  At higher ranks familiar individuals may be identified.

3. Determine if the heat radiated by source is being generated by
magic, e.g.  the Adept is able to distinguish between normal and
magical fire.  (Note only Fire College infravision has this ability).

The Adept may re-attempt any of these abilities after a period of 41
pulses (2 / Rank) has elapsed or if the Adept is 20 feet closer to the
target.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Pyrogenesis}

\range{Sight}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{MA + 5 / Rank - 1 / 5 feet separating the Adept from the
  target (after the first 5 feet)}
\resist{Passive}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cause to burst into flame a single mass of dry,
flammable material weighing up to 1oz (+ 1/5 ranks). Once alight it
will burn normally and may be extinguished by either mundane or
magical means.  Flammable materials are defined as wood, paper, cloth
etc, but not flesh, except that Pyrogenesis may be used to cremate
insects and small creatures within the maximum weight restrictions.
This talent cannot be used on possessions. Utilising this talent
requires a pass action, and is obvious to observers.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\target{Entity, Object, Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept causes a bolt of Fire to streak from their hand towards
anywhere in range.  The first entity or object the bolt hits in its
path must resist or suffer D (+ 1 / Rank) damage.  If the bolt does
not hit anything it will dissipate at the end of its range. At Rank 20
the Adept may delay releasing the bolt for a pulse if they should
choose.

\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Object, Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell protects the target against damage by fire for 4 (+ 4 /
Rank) points of protection.  Protection is ablative and when the
damage the spell may absorb is exceeded, the spell is dissipated with
any excess damage applied to the target.  Double and triple effects
may apply to duration or degree of protection.  At Rank 20 the spell
confers 100 points of protection.
\end{effects}

\storage{Investment}
\target{Object, Point}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a source of light emanating in all directions from
an object or point touched by them. At ranks 0 to 5 the light emitted
is equivalent to that of a torch, at ranks 6 to 10 that of a small
campfire, at ranks 11 to 15 a large campfire, and at ranks 16 to 20 a
bonfire.  The light emitted will have the appearance of firelight of
the appropriate strength.  It is magical light, and will cast poor
contrast shadows.

\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity, Object}
\begin{effects}
The spell protects the target from all non-magical fire and heat
effects up to the heat equiva- lent of a bonfire.  An entity or object
is also protected against smoke effects (including smoke inhalation),
heatstroke and sunstroke.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Increase Temperature}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Volume, Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept must remain in contact with the target for heating to
occur. When the spell ends the target will cool normally.

Solids 
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
The Adept may heat 1 lb (+ 1 / Rank) of solid material up to 50 (+ 50
/ Rank) degrees C.  The Adept may choose any combination of
temperature increase increment and mass increment to a total of the
Adept’s rank.  The temperature increase takes 10 seconds / 100 degrees
/ pound mass. At Rank 20 any metal item within the weight limit of the
Adept can be reduced to molten slag in as little as 10 seconds
(resistance roll is applicable).

Liquids 
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
The Adept may heat 1 (+ 1 / Rank) pints of liquid up to 20 (+ 20 /
Rank) degrees C.  They may choose any combination of temperature
increase increment and mass increment to a total of the Adept’s rank.
The temperature increase takes 10 seconds / 10 degrees / pint. The
volume of material that may be affected is increased by 6 times at
Rank 20.

Gases 
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
The Adept may cause the temperature of a closed contiguous volume of
gas (such as air) to increase.  The volume affected is equal to 125 (+
125 / Rank) cubic feet. The temperature can be increased by up to 2(C
per Rank.  At Rank 20 the volume that can be affected by Increase
Temperature is doubled

\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\begin{spell}[G-7]{Slow Fire}
\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell increases the duration that a wood, lamp or oil fire will
burn for by 1 (+ 1 / Rank) hours. Light remains constant while the
spell is in effect but heat from the fire source is halved.  This
spell may be used to slow the effects of small fires or to ensure a
fire lasts for a considerable period of time.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\begin{spell}[G-8]{Smoke Creation}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may create a volume of smoke equal to 1000 cubic feet (+ 500
/ Rank). This volume must be closed and contiguous, and has a minimum
thickness of 5 feet.  The density of the smoke may vary from light
vapours at Rank 0 to thick, roiling smoke at Rank 20.  The Adept may
choose the density of the smoke when casting. The smoke produced
reduces visual perception by 1 multiplier per 5 full ranks (but may
not reduce it to less than once times perception).  The effective Rank
of the spell will be decreased by 1 Rank per 10 miles/hour of wind
(minimum Rank 0) in the target volume. Below rank 10 the smoke created
by this spell is completely transparent to infravision.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\section{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Binding Fire}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{None}
\target{Fire}
\material{Fire source + Endurance (optional)}
Actions: Chanting and dancing 
Concentration Check: Standard 
\begin{effects}
The Adept gains complete control over a fire source as large as 10 (+
10 / Rank) cubic feet.  This fire may then be moulded and shaped as
desired but with a minimum of one foot thickness in any dimension.
Regardless of the shape created, the fire retains its normal heat and
damaging prop- erties. Damage is as per a large bonfire or [D - 3] if
the entity is within one hex.  Bound fire is unaf- fected by normal
rains and winds short of hurricane conditions, but may be extinguished
by a dousing of water of similar or greater volume than the fire.

If the Adept sacrifices 2 points of Endurance from a sentient as part
of the ritual, the duration of the Ritual of Binding Fire is enhanced
to 1 year (+ 1 / Rank).

If the Adept sacrifices 4 points of Endurance from a sentient creature
the duration of the Ritual of Binding Fire is permanent. This Fire is
bound to a specific non-movable item from which the fire appears to
issue (e.g. a ruby set in a wall, a line of runes on a floor etc).
Permanent Bound Fire can be suppressed for [21 - Rank] minutes by a
dousing of water of similar or greater volume than the fire, attack
with magical cold for more damage than the damage rating of the fire
etc. To dissipate a permanent Bound Fire the object to which it is
bound must be broken, destroyed or seriously defaced.

The Adept may instil basic intelligence in a Bound Fire if desired and
give the entity thus created simple commands.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}


\section{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Cleansing Flame}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank above 10}
\duration{125 seconds - 5 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Potion, Ward, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target is wreathed in yellowy green flames causing hideous
suffering, yet curing the target of the effects of natural poisons
(acts as Rank / 2 vs. synthetic poison), venoms, fevers and
diseases. As the foulness is burnt away, the flames change colour
until they become silvery white.  While cleansing takes place any
ongoing harm is halted.  At the end of the duration, the target is
cured and their possessions are cleaned to a high polish.  During the
cleansing all the target’s Strike Chances, Defence and Cast Chances
are reduced by 25 (-1 / Rank).  This spell only affects willing
targets. At Rank 20 this spell also cures the effects of Malignant
Flames. This spell can also be used to cure burns, including third
degree burns but scar- ring from burns are not affected.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\begin{spell}[S-2]{Dragon Flames}
\range{Special}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may breathe magical fire like a Dragon causing D10 (+ 3 /
Rank) damage to entities within the area of effect. The area of effect
is a cone issuing from the Adepts mouth and is 20 feet (+ 5 / Rank)
long, and 5 (+ 5 / 3 Ranks) wide at end farthest from the Adept. If an
entity resists the damage is halved, unless they are more than half
immersed in water (eg. swimming) where they take no damage.  Dragon
Flames are analogous to an instantaneous flash of heat, but there are
no over- pressure or explosive effects.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Fire Arc}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may transform 1 entity (+ 1 / 3 or fraction Ranks) into a
bolt of fire that flashes to any unobstructed point in line of sight
up to 25 (+ 25 / Rank) feet away. The bolt must land within 5 feet of
a potentially flammable substance, an entity or a solid surface.  When
the bolt arrives, it bursts into flame causing D10 damage to all
entities within 1 hex.  At Rank 20 the target may instanta- neously
return to the point of origin of the spell at the end of the next
pulse should they so desire.  Double and triple effects apply to range
only. This spell affects only willing targets and will not work
underwater. Any barriers, wards etc that are passed over affect the
targets as if crossed normally.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Fireball}

\range{60 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{550}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept conjures a ball of fire 1 foot in diameter which rushes to a
point in line of sight of the Adept, and explodes in a radius of 5
foot (+ 5 / 5 or fraction Ranks). Everything in this radius must
resist or suffer D10 (+ 1 / Rank) damage.  If an entity resists the
damage is halved, unless they are more than half immersed in water
(e.g. swimming) where they take no damage.  The spell may set
flammable items afire when it bursts.  Hard cover (e.g. walls,
parapets, but not shields) reduces damage to half before resistance.
In some instances, e.g.  a character wading through water, resistance
may negate all damage. The fireball is analogous to an instantaneous
flash of heat and there are no over-pressure or explosive effects.  A
fireball may be detonated prematurely by the imposition of barriers in
its line of flight.

At Rank 20 this spell may be cast with a detonation delay of up to 10
pulses.  This extends the casting time 4 pulses.  A delayed blast
fireball manifests itself as a 1 foot wide floating sphere of fire
until detonation occurs. If a second fireball is cast within the
proposed volume of effect of the first, both are detonated.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Heat Shield}

\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}

\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Object, Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell protects the target against damage by cold or ice for 4 (+
4 / Rank) points of protection.  Protection is ablative and when the
damage the spell may absorb is exceeded, the spell is dissipated with
any excess damage applied to the target. Double and triple effects may
apply to duration or degree of protection.

\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This sulphurous fire attacks 1 target for every 3 (or fraction) Ranks.
The target’s Magical Resistance is reduced by 5 (+ 1 / Rank). The
spell does D10 (+ 2 / Rank) damage to each target.  If a target
successfully resists, they suffer only half damage (round up).  Double
damage adds an additional 1 / Rank damage and triple damage adds an
additional 2 / Rank damage.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Immolation}

\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept gains the grace and form of a dancing flame, without in
anyway altering their physical nature, but increasing their defence by
2 (+ 3 / 2 Ranks).  Any entity that is within 5 feet must resist or
take 1 / 2 (or fraction) Ranks Fire damage per pulse.  The target will
glow with the same degree of brightness as a Firelight spell 5 Ranks
lower, (minimum 1).  The target appears to be a humanoid shape
composed of flame.  If the target hides in a fire, the target may only
be detected by witchsight or by infravision..
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Malignant Flames}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{550}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target is swathed in flames that are only visible to the victim
causing D10 (+ 2 / Rank) damage. If the spell is at rank 5 or higher
the target may be cursed with the loss of [D - 4] (+1 / 5 Ranks)
points from one characteristic or statistic, as chosen by the Adept.
A characteristic may not be reduced below 1 as a result of this spell.
This minor curse will last 4 (+ 1 / Rank) days.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Pyrotechnics}

\range{60 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
This spell may be mistaken for a Fireball.  The Adept conjures a ball
of fire 1 foot in diameter which rushes to a point in line of sight of
the Adept, and bursts in a radius of 5 foot (+ 5 / 5 or fraction
Ranks) with an enormous flash of light and fireworks.  Any entity in
this radius who can see must resist or they are dazzled by the flash
for [D - 5] (+ 1 / 3 or fraction Ranks) pulses. Dazzled entities have
their strike chances, cast chances and perception checks reduced by 1
(+ 2 / Rank). Entities without normal vision (e.g.  Undead) are
unaffected by Pyrotechnics.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Speak to Fire Creatures}

\multiple{75}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
This spell allows the Adept to communicate with all fire creatures
within range.  This communication is at an effective language rank of
1 (+ 1 / 2 Ranks).  For the purposes of this spell, fire creatures
are: Elementals, Salamanders, Efreets, desert creatures and creatures
created using a Binding Fire Ritual.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Summoning Salamander}

\range{Unlimited}
\duration{Until dispelled}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Salamander}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon a salamander which will then attempt to set afire
anything flammable that it can reach. A Salamander may only be
summoned to an environment it can survive in (e.g.  a large fire
source, volcano, in a desert). The Adept has no control over the
salamander. Dispelling the spell returns the salamander to its origin.

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-12]{Weapon of Flames}

\range{5 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Weapon}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cause any weapon to burst into flame but without causing
damage to the weapon or its wielder.  The weapon has its Strike Chance
increased by 1 (+ 1 / Rank), damage increased by + 1 / 2 (or fraction)
Ranks.  When the weapon is used against a entity which are creatures
of cold or water or against the Undead, damage increases to 1 / Rank.
A missile may also be the target (e.g.  arrow), but not missile
weapons.  At rank 11 any hand-held weapon may be created from fire.
This weapon has normal characteristic requirements but no weight.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-13]{Wall of Fire}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Passive}

\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may create a 5 foot high × 20 foot long × 1 foot thick wall
of flames, or a 5 foot high × 1 foot thick circle of flames with a 5
foot radius, or a pillar of fire 15 feet high with a 2 foot radius.
The Adept can increase any single dimension by 1 foot / Rank.  The
wall must be anchored to a surface and cannot easily be seen
through. Any object or entity that passes through the wall must resist
or suffer D10 ( + 1 / Rank) damage.  If an entity resists the damage
is halved.  The wall will provide light equivalent to a large
campfire.  At Rank 20 the Adept may double the damage of a Wall of
Fire by halving its duration.

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-14]{Wildfires}

\range{Touch}
\duration{20 minutes + 20 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell imbues an entity with the speed and essence of a forest
fire.  The target may run without tiring at a speed of 20 (+ 2 / Rank)
miles per hour over any solid surface.  Additionally they may “run”
across any substance that would ordi- narily support fire (e.g.
across tree tops, up a wooden wall, or across oil). Like a fire,
momentum effects do not apply to the target: they may take corners at
impossible angles, climb a flammable surface impossibly quickly, or
stop instantly in place. The target may leap a gap (as a fire leaps a
firebreak) a horizontal distance of PS (+ 1 / Rank) feet or a vertical
distance of 1/2 PS (+ 1 / Rank) feet. The target will leave charred
footprints behind them but will not normally ignite surfaces they
cross.

An entity under Wildfires is moving too quickly to undertake normal
tactical combat or to otherwise interact with other entities.  If they
wish to engage in melee they must dissipate the spell.

The target must keep moving at least two hexes in any direction per
pulse.  If they stop the spell is dissipated.  When the spell ends the
target stops instantly in place.

At Rank 20 the target may extend the duration of the spell by
suffering 1 EN damage / 10 additional minutes.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

Actions: Chanting and dancing 
Concentration Check: Standard 
\begin{effects}
This ritual increases temperature in the target area by 2C per Rank,
slowly building up at 2 degrees C per hour. This may impede rainfall,
kills plants, dry up wells, ponds, etc and ruin crops if repeated
regularly.  In cold or icy areas climes it may make an area tolerable
for life for a time or result in standing fogs if the difference
between climes is too extreme.

\material{Small fire}
Actions: Staring into flames 
Concentration Check: Standard 
\begin{effects}
The Adept must sit next to a fire and stare into the flames for half
an hour.  They may then attempt one of three visions:

• A view as if the Adept was looking out of a fire within 1/2 a mile
(+ 1/4 mile Rank).  The Adept may choose to look out of a specific
fire, otherwise the fire is randomly determined from all those in
range.  If no fires are within range the Adept will see nothing.  They
may move their viewpoint within the fire so as to see in any
direction. There is no way to perceive that a fire is looked through
by this ritual.

• A precognitive vision which is controlled by the GM.  The detail of
this vision and the amount of information obtained increases with
rank.

• If the Adept chooses to sacrifice an object (which is destroyed) in
the fire, they gain a vision relevant to that object’s past.  This
version of the ritual can only be performed on flammable objects.

\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon a Lesser Efreeti to act as a steed for
themselves. The Lesser Efreeti will obey all its rider’s commands
while it is mounted. If the rider is not mounted or is out of its
presence then it will only follow simple passive commands (e.g. wait
here, go there). At Rank 14 or higher it will obey commands which move
it away from the rider (e.g. go attack people behind the hill, go and
pick up Bob).

Its characteristics and statistics are based on either 
the Adept or their rank in the ritual. 

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={XX}}
PS = 30 (+ 2 / Rank)  & MD = Adept \\
EN = 30 (+ 1 / Rank)  & AG = Adept \\
FT = 30 (+ 2 / Rank)  & WP = Adept \\

\item[Natural Armour] WP / 4 (+ 1 / 3 or fraction Ranks)
\item[DEF] WP + Ritual BC / 2]
\item[TMR] Walking = 5 (+ Rank / 4); Flying 8 (+ Rank / 3)
\item[Movement Rate] 20 (+ 2 / Rank) miles per hour
\item[Size] 1 (+ 1 / 10 Ranks) hexes
\item[Weapons]
The Lesser Efreeti has three physical attacks, two claws and a bite.
These have a base chance of 40\% and do D + 4 (+ 1 / 2 Ranks) damage.
It also has a 65\% chance of igniting in battle with flames extending
in a 5 foot radius.  Entities within the radius, except for the rider,
must resist or suffer D (+ 1 / 2 Ranks) damage.  Entities that resist
suffer half damage.
\item[Abilities]
The Lesser Efreeti is immune to damage from fire but takes double
damage from ice or water and magic resistance to these attacks is
reduced by 10\%.  It cannot be banished while the rider is mounted.
\end{description}

At Rank 20 the ritual has extra benefits:  

\begin{itemize}
\item the adept may nominate another entity as the rider.

\item the Lesser Efreeti has Strength and Fatigue of 80 and Endurance
  of 60.

\item NA is 8 (+ WP / 4).

\item damage from claws and bite is [D + 16].  

\item the ritual’s duration is 24 hours. 
\end{itemize}

This ritual may double or triple duration and may backfire. It may be
invested with a material cost of 50,000 silver pieces per charge.

\begin{ritual}[R-4]{Summon Fire Elemental}

\range{20 feet}
\duration{Concentration, no maximum}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{MA + 4\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Fire Elemental}
\material{Large fire}
Actions: Concentration 
Concentration Check: Standard 
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon a Fire Elemental with a combined endurance and
fatigue of 15 (+ 5 / Rank) which appears within the fire.  The
Elemental is under the Adept’s control but strongly resents being
summoned.

If the ritual backfires the elemental arrives uncontrolled and will
immediately attempt to kill the summoner.

The Elemental is returned to its own dimension if the summoner’s
concentration is broken, it is banished, or the Adept casts a Fire
Special Counterspell.

\section{Damage by Burning}

Occasionally a character will suffer damage from falling in to, or
being exposed to, fire. The following table indicates the pulse by
pulse damage taken by an entity being in contact with fire. While
ignition of flammables on a person will not always occur, if an entity
is immersed in fire (e.g. passage through a Wall of Fire) flammable
possessions will catch alight.  Unless otherwise specified, Magical
Fire will automatically ignite flammables.

If the pulse after ignition is spent putting flammables out, no
further damage occurs.  In general exposure to a fire source indicates
exposure for a full pulse, therefore standing in a bonfire might hurt
a character but simply jumping through one might not. This table
should be used as a guide to how much damage exposure to a particular
fire source might cause.

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={Xl}}
Clothing alight after passage through a fire	& D + 3 \\
Standing in campfire 				& D + 5 \\
Standing in a one Hex bonfire 			& D + 10 \\
Very large bonfire, house fire 			& D + 15 \\
Raging forest fire 				& D + 25 \\
Immersion in boiling water 			& D + 35 \\
Immersion in boiling oil 			& D + 50 \\
Immersion in molten metal or lava 		& D + 100 \\
Sauron’s forge 					& D + 150 \\
