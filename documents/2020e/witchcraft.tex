\begin{College}[1.1]{witchcraft}{Witchcraft}{WI}

The College of Witchcraft is concerned with natural magics, the
rhythms of the world, and especially with blessings and curses.
Practitioners of the College of Witchcraft are commonly known as
Witches if female, Warlocks if male, or collectively as Wicca. This
College is without doubt the most primitive and least formal in its
approach to magic.  The Wicca generally feel themselves to be more in
tune with the world than the various Elemental Colleges, who dedicate
themselves to only part of the whole, and certainly more than the
Thaumaturgists who practise a sterile and scientific magic.  The
widespread use of Witchcraft predates the present renaissance of magic
on Alusia and Wicca are much more often found practising their trade
in small towns and villages than in cities.  Novice Wicca will usually
have been apprenticed to a local Witch or Warlock rather than having
attended any form of Magical Academy.

The College’s magic touches on alchemy, herbalism and astrology, and
many Wicca possess some of these skills.  The other Colleges often
treat Wicca with a degree of contempt as they view this dabbling with
“quasi-magic” to be less than worthwhile.  This is not to say that the
Wicca are without power, as experienced Adepts of Witchcraft have
available to them powerful magics, fully the equal of any other
College. In these destructive and powerful magics there lies danger
however, and some Wicca become so obsessed with the “darker” side of
natural magic that they begin to follow the Dark Path of magic and
make agreements with the Powers of Darkness so as to further their
material goals. These Adepts are often known as “Black Mages” and are
greatly feared.  Many “Black Mages” view the other members of the
College as weak or foolish for failing to exploit the powers they
possess.  At the other extreme, some Wicca follow a path of pacifism,
and eschew the curses and destructive side of Witchcraft.  These
Adepts are sometimes referred to as “White Mages” or “White Witches”,
in contrast to their darker brethren.  Most Wicca view both of these
extremes as unfortunate deviances from the College’s holistic path.
Many of the Agents of the Powers are Wicca as the College’s general
and undivided outlook does not conflict often with a Power’s
interests.

Being highly in tune with magic as a whole, Wicca are more sensitive
to changes in the “mana flow” than other Colleges.  The Wicca’s magic
is somewhat affected by the presence of large amounts of spirit such
as from proximity to many entities, or from a lessening of the “mana
flow”, such as on the certain “mana poor” days of the year, which have
universally become known as “High Holidays” of the Elohim, the spirit
Powers. Conversely, a Wicca’s powers increase when away from sources
of spirit and on certain “magic rich” days, sometimes referred to as
“Faerie days”.  Finally, due to the ancient nature of the College and
the equally ancient association between the elements of light and
spirit, a Wicca’s powers are slightly decreased during the hours of
daylight, whether the Wicca is in light or not, and are slightly
enhanced during the hours of darkness.

\subsection{Traditional Colours}

Wicca usually wear clothing in the colours of nature itself, in much
the same way as the Elemental mages, but often in combination that the
Elementals do not use.  Blues and greens reminiscent of sky and sea
are worn with the light browns of the earth, and with the warm golds
and oranges of autumn or fire.  “Black Mages” traditionally cloak
themselves in midnight robes sometimes embroidered with pentagrams and
other Daemon associated symbols, whilst “White Mages” often wear robes
of bleached or unbleached wool or linen.

\subsubsection{Traditional Symbols}

Animals are most commonly associated with the Wicca as many Adepts of
this College keep animal familiars with cats, ravens, toads and owls
being the most usual.  There is only one symbol that is often
connected with the Wicca, the Great Wheel of Being, representing light
and darkness, earth and air, water and fire, spirit and mana.  This
symbol sometimes appears as an eight pointed star or eight arrows
radiating from a central point, and at other times as two circles
passing through each other at right angles, or even simply, as two
intersecting circles. Black Mages often use and wear Daemonic symbols,
but very seldom use the Great Wheel.  White Wicca seldom use any
symbols, but when they do, the Great Wheel is the most common.


\section{Restrictions}

Adepts  of  the  College  of  Witchcraft  may  practice 
their arts without restriction. 

The MA requirement for this College is 18. 


\section{Base Chance Modifiers}

The Base Chance of performing any talent, spell or 
ritual of this College is modified by the addition of 
the following numbers: 

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={Xr}}
From sunrise to sunset				& −5 \\
From sunset to sunrise				& +5 \\
In large town or city (pop. greater than 2000)	& −5 \\
In small town or village (pop. 500 to 2000)	& 0  \\
In hamlet or rural (pop. less than 500)		& +5 \\
Mana poor day					& −5 \\
Mana rich (Faerie) day				& +5 \\
In a high mana area				& +5 \\
In a low mana area				& −5 \\
\end{dqtblr}

All modifiers are cumulative.  Those modifiers pertaining to sunrise
and sunset are applied depending on the hour of day, and not on
whether the Wicca is standing in light or darkness.  A Wiccan
underground with no light during the day still receives the negative
modifier.  Modifiers pertaining to population, refer to the population
of sentient beings, within 1 mile of the Wicca.


\section{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Farsensing}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Active concentration}
\multiple{150}
\target{Familiar}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can, by remaining stationary and actively concentrating for
the duration of the talent’s workings, see, hear, taste, smell and
feel the same things as their familiar, provided that their familiar
is within 15 feet (+ 15 feet / Rank) of their position.  This talent
allows no special communication with the familiar, merely the ability
to utilise their senses.  The Adept must have already acquired a
familiar through the use of Finding Familiar Ritual (Q-1) for this
talent to be effective.

It takes about 10 seconds (-1 / Rank) for the Adept to tune in to the
familiar’s senses. If the familiar is killed while the Adept is using
this talent the magical backlash is harsher, due to the tighter link,
and the amount of magical damage incurred is increased by 5 points,
see Q-1.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Special Alchemy}
\begin{effects}
The Adept gains certain knowledge of Alchemy.  The specific benefits
accruing to the Adept are:

\begin{Description}
\item[Distilling Venoms] The ability to distill venoms from such
  plants as belladonna.  The Adept functions as a Rank 1 Alchemist
  for this purpose.  See the Alchemist Skill.

\item[Distilling Toad’s Sweat] The ability to distill a dose of a
  potion of Toad Sweat that will remove blemishes, warts, corns,
  pimples, etc., at the rate of 1 disfigurement (wart, corn, etc.)  (+
  1 / Rank) per dose.  The Experience Multiple for this potion is 100
  and its cost is 50 Silver Pennies.  The Base Chance of effectively
  preparing it is 60\% (+ 2 / Rank).

\item[Making  Amulets]  The  ability  to  make  the  following amulets: 
\begin{Description}
\item[Amethyst] Wards bad dreams and assists the wearer in achieving a
  restful sleep.  Increases the wearer’s Fatigue recovery during sleep
  periods by 10\% (round down). Cost: 3000 SP.

\item[Aquilegius] The wearer subtracts 10 from all rolls on the Fear
  Table. Cost: 2400 SP.

\item[Beryl] Increases the wearer’s ability to detect traps and
  ambushes by 5. Cost: 4000 SP.

\item[Betony] Decreases the Base Chance of infection by 15. Cost: 2200
  SP.

\item[Bloodstone] Prevents miscarriage and decreases Base Chance of
  infection by 20. Cost: 3000 SP.

\item[Carbuncle] Decreases damage done by poison by 2 points of damage
  per pulse or day. Cost: 9600 SP.

\item[Chalcedony] No undead will willingly approach closer than 10
  feet to the wearer in most cases.  Cost: 4800 SP.

\item[Diamonds] Increases all of the wearer’s Strike Chances by
  2. Cost: 8000 SP.

\item[Elder Flowers] Makes the wearer proof against the Evil
  Eye. Cost: 400 SP.

\item[Hypericum] Increases the wearer’s Magical Resistance by 10 to
  any magical act performed by a Demon or Daemonic being. Cost: 800
  SP.

\item[Iron] No Demon or Daemonic being will willingly approach closer
  than 10 feet to the wearer in most cases. Cost: 4000 SP.

\item[Jade] No undead will willingly approach closer than 30 feet to
  the wearer in most cases. Cost: 4000 SP.

\item[Jet] No Demon or Daemonic being will willingly approach closer
  than 50 feet to the wearer in most cases. Cost: 4800 SP.

\item[Luck] Made from tiger’s or alligator’s teeth.  It increases the
  wearer’s Magical Resistance by 3 and adds 2 to the wearer’s
  defence. Cost: 2400 SP.
\end{Description}
Note that the “cost” is the cost of material necessary to manufacture
the amulet.  Each amulet requires 3 days to manufacture once the
necessary materials have been gathered or purchased.  Amulets are
usually sold at (cost + 25\%).  The time taken to prepare an Amulet is
full-time work, and no training may be undertaken at the same time.
Those Amulets that prevent the “willing approach” of certain creatures
create a “circle of protection” around the wearer. The creatures
protected against will not willingly cross the circle’s boundary, but
if forced across it, for instance by the approach of the wearer, are
no longer inconvenienced by the protection.

\item[Love Philtre] The ability to distill from a variety of
  substances a Love Philtre which will cause the imbiber to fall in
  love with the first entity upon whom he or she sets eyes after
  drinking it (regardless of species or sex). The Base Chance to
  prepare the Philtre is 30\% (+ 3 / Rank) and the Experience Multiple
  is 200.  The cost of the materials will average 600 silver pieces.
  The effects of the substance will last for 1 week (+ 1 week /
  Rank), unless dispelled by the casting of the General Knowledge
  Counterspell of the College of Witchcraft by the creator of the Love
  Philtre, or by the successful use of the Curse Removal Ritual. In
  the latter case, the curse is treated as Minor.

\item[Fertility / Infertility] Potion The ability to distill from a
  variety of substances a Potion of Fertility or Infertility that
  increases or decreases the chances of conception by 5\% (+ 5 /
  Rank). It has a 30\% (+ 3 / Rank) chance of working and may be
  passivelyresisted by the imbiber. The effects of the Potion of
  Fertility last 1 day (+1 per 3 or fraction Ranks) whilst that of the
  Potion of Infertility last 1 week (+1 per 3 or fraction Ranks),
  unless dispelled by the casting of the General Knowledge
  Counterspell of the College of Witchcraft by the creator of the
  Potion or a Ritual of Remove Curse is employed. If the latter option
  is taken, the curse is considered a Minor Curse.  The Experience
  Multiple for this potion is 200 and its cost is 100 Silver
  Pennies. See Conception (\S\ref{health:conception}) for conception
  chances.
\end{Description}
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-3]{Witchsight}

\multiple{200}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may see objects or entities which are invisible and they
appear to have a slight blue sheen around them.  If the invisibility
effect (excluding Walking Unseen) is of a higher Rank than the
Witchsight, the object or entity may not be clearly identified or
directly magically targeted.  The Adept may also see in the dark as a
Human does on a cloudy day, with an effective range of vision of 150
feet under the open sky, and 75 feet elsewhere.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\section{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Damnum Minatum}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept curses any one target within range with a particular
unpleasantness as listed below. Some of the effects are identical to
backfire results; such effects are cross referenced to the backfire
table (\S\ref{table:backfire}).  If the effects of the curse are
doubled or tripled, the Adept may inflict 2 or 3 different results.
The curse is permanent until a General Knowledge Counterspell of the
College of Witchcraft is cast over the afflicted entity, a Ritual of
Remove Curse is employed, the duration expires, or the effect is cured
by a healer of the appropriate Rank. Curses that have a duration, or
may be cured by a Healer are indicated in their descriptions. If a
Ritual of Remove Curse is employed, the Damnum Minatum is considered a
Minor Curse.  A separate Counterspell or Ritual of Remove Curse must
be used on each separate curse.  Identical Damnum Minatum effects are
not cumulative.  Note that the Adept may always choose to inflict a
curse of lesser Rank than their actual Rank.  The Curses that the
Adept may inflict are dependent on the Rank of the spell:

\begin{Description}
  \item[0–3] Boils 1 (+ l / Rank); Warts 1 (+1 / Rank). 
  \item[4–6] Clumsiness (-l AG); Maladroitness (-l MD). 
  \item[7–9] Weakness (-2 PS); Poor health (-3 EN). 
  \item[10–11] Cowardice (-3 WP \& +5 Fright/Awe rolls);

\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Darkness}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{15 minutes + 15 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{60\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a volume in which non-magical light is partially
suppressed.  The volume will be 1000 (+ 500 / Rank) cubic feet, and
may be in any one contiguous area the Adept desires, provided that no
dimension is smaller than one foot.  The entire volume must be visible
and within range at time of casting, and may not be moved.  For
visibility purposes, the Spell will increase Darkness levels within
the volume to 60\% + 2\% / Rank.  Rank 20 Darkness may not be seen
through. It will not aid in providing bonuses for casting purposes,
though it will neutralise penalties due to natural light, to a maximum
of 5\% + 1\% / Rank. The volume counts as direct shadow for Star \&
Shadow Mages.  If the lighting conditions are lower than that provided
by the spell, no effect will be apparent.  Note that because light is
only being suppressed, it may still pass through, and no shadows are
generated outside the volume. If it is possible to see through a
Darkness, everything beyond it is normally visible.  This spell can
engender silhouettes of lit objects against the darkness, though not
create shadows.  Any of this volume may be overridden by a higher
ranked Spell of Light, or neutralised (back to original conditions) by
an equal rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Decay}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cause an amount of food, produce or beverage to quickly
age, moulder, spoil and rot.  Upon casting the spell the targeted
matter will decay, causing parasitic fungi to spring forth, and an
odour of decay to prevail.  The spell may ruin up to 1 cubic foot of
food and drink (+ 1 cubic foot / Rank). If a double or triple effect
is achieved the amount of food that is spoiled may be doubled or
trebled. Once affected by the spell the food and drink will thereafter
be inedible.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Fear}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept instills in the target an uncontrollable fear. Unless the
target successfully resists they must roll on the Fright Table
(\S\ref{table:fright}).  If a double effect is achieved, the Adept may
choose to modify the Fright Table roll up or down by an amount equal
to the rank of the spell.  If a triple effect is achieved the Adept
may modify the Fright Table roll by twice the rank of the spell.  See
the Fright Table for the exact results of the Fear.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Harming Entity}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 second + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Unless successfully resisted, the Adept causes the target intense pain
for the duration of the spell.  The target must check to see if their
concentration is broken and must subtract 10 (+ 3 / Rank) from their
Strike Chances whilst suffering the pain.  The difficulty multiplier
for the Concentration Check is dependent on the Rank of the spell:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={m{4em}X}}
Rank	& Multiplier \\
0--5	& 3.0 \\
6--10	& 2.5 \\
11--15	& 2.0 \\
16--19	& 1.0 \\
20	& 0.5 \\
\end{dqtblr}

No actual damage is inflicted as a result of this spell.  Note that
Mind Mages will be somewhat unaffected by this spell, and may halve
the reduction to their Strike Chances.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Hypnotism}

\range{15 feet}
\duration{Concentration: maximum 5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may lull an entity that is within range into a trance-like
state in which they will be subject to suggestion.  The spell may not
be cast over a totally hostile entity.  Once the subject has been
hypnotised, the Adept may make suggestions (provided that they can
communicate verbally with the subject) that will be readily accepted
unless they directly conflict with the subject’s best interests.  The
subject will remain suggestible so long as the Adept maintains
concentration and the subject remains in range.  The subject will
continue to implement implanted suggestions for 3 hours (+ 3 / Rank)
after the suggestions have been made, even when no longer hypnotised.
The subject will never have any idea where the suggestion that it is
implementing came from.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may call forth fire and cause flammable material (cloth,
paper wood, and similar items, but not flesh) to burst into flames.
The material will thereafter burn normally and the flames may be
extinguished by normal means.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Mind Cloak}

\duration{1 hour + 2 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a cloak around their own mind so that their thoughts
cannot be detected or read.  This spell does not prevent the Adept’s
presence or emotions from being detected, but their mind will simply
not appear to be there when an attempt is made to “read” it.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9]{Protection Against Were-Creatures}

\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}

\begin{effects}
The spell creates an invisible Circle of Protection with a radius of
15 feet (+ 1 / Rank) which will not willingly be crossed by any
Were-creature or Shapechanger in beast form unless they successfully
resist the circle’s effects upon first encountering it.  Even if the
Circle’s effects are resisted, the Were-creature or Shapechanger will
be discomforted while within the Circle, and will have their Strike
Chances reduced by 10.  If the circle is seen with the use of
Witchsight, it will appear as a glowing red circle, similar to a ring
of fire.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-10]{Storm Calling}

\range{Works at any range}
\duration{60 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Special}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon any storm front which may exist anywhere in
sight. Upon reaching the spot occupied by the Adept at the time of
casting, the storm front will slow and finally cease moving and begin
a downpour (snow, rain, hail, sleet, or whatever else that the GM
feels the clouds may contain).  Generally a storm front can be seen
for 20 to 30 miles. If no front can be seen the spell may still be
cast, but the Base Chance is reduced by 20. The storm front will take
[D × 3 - 1 / Rank] minutes to arrive.  Once the duration has expired,
the weather will gradually return to normal over a similar amount of
time.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-11]{Summoning Enchanted Creatures}

\storage{Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon 1 enchanted fantastical creature (+ 1 per 5 or
fraction Ranks).  Only creatures that are native to the area may be
summoned.  It will take them D10 minutes (15 seconds / Rank), minimum
1 minute, to arrive and they will be uncontrolled when they do arrive.
If more than 1 creature is summoned, all must be of the same type.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-12]{Walking Unseen}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{60\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion, Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not invisible.  This
means that it will not transmit light. As a consequence the target
will cast a shadow, which may or may not be noticed, depending on the
lighting conditions, etc, and will have a reflection in a mirror or
other reflective surface.  However, the target may not be noticed even
if another entity is looking directly at them.  An entity will get a
Perception check to notice the target if the target becomes invasive
on the entity’s senses (e.g. standing next to the entity and putting
their hands over the entity’s eyes).  Note that a Crystal of Vision or
similar means of viewing is considered direct viewing and is affected
by this spell.  If the target, or the target’s possessions, are
touched by another entity, or an entity’s possessions, then the spell
is broken.  Although not truly invisible, the target may be detected
by using magical means to detect invisible entities (e.g.
Witchsight).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-13]{Wind Whistle}

\range{Self}
\duration{D10 hours}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to create a wind over an open space of up to 100
feet (+ 100 / Rank) in diameter, centred upon themselves. Outside of
this area the wind will fade back to the prevailing wind over half
again the distance. The wind will build up over [D - 2] minutes and
the Adept must choose before that time which direction the wind will
blow.  The speed of the wind is determined by a D100 roll as follows:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={m{4em}X}}
Dice	& Velocity \\
01--10	& 35 mph \\
11--25	& 15 mph \\
26–50	& 10 mph \\
51–75	& 25 mph \\
76–90	& 35 mph \\
91–100	& 45 mph \\
\end{dqtblr}

The Adept may add or subtract a number equal to the Rank of the spell
from the dice roll used to determine velocity.  This need not be done
until after the dice have been rolled and the result ascertained.  If
a double or triple effect is achieved the Adept may add or subtract
double or treble the Rank of the spell.  If the resulting wind is over
30 mph missile fire will be affected, reducing Base Chances by the
(wind speed / 2) but extending ranges by a similar number of hexes if
firing with the wind, or reducing them respectively if firing into the
wind.

\resist{None}
\target{Animal}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{A piece of food acceptable to the type of animal being summoned}
\actions{Concentration}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may attempt to summon a small animal that will serve them as
a familiar. The type of animal is chosen by the Adept and may be any
natural, unenchanted, small animal such as a cat, dog, bat, rat, toad,
weasel, falcon, owl, goat, monkey, trout, etc, and must be native to
the area in which the summoning is performed.  If the summoning is
successful, an animal of the chosen sort will arrive at the Adept’s
location in (25 - Rank) minutes.  The ritual allows the Adept to
communicate with the animal when it first arrives.  The Adept must
promise to feed and protect the animal.  The GM should roll a reaction
check for the animal.  If the result is Enraged, the animal attacks,
if Belligerent it leaves immediately.  If neither of these results are
achieved, the animal agrees to serve the Adept as a familiar.
Regardless of the result, the Ritual confers no further ability to
communicate with the animal. If the Adept fails to feed the familiar
on a regular basis, or mistreats it in any way, the familiar may run
away, and a new familiar must be found.  The familiar will serve the
Adept to the best of its ability, warning them of danger, and so
forth.  If the Adept is unable to communicate with the familiar
magically it will attempt to warn them by tugging at their cloak,
whimpering, or whatever, as appropriate.  If the familiar is killed,
the Adept suffers [D + 5] points of damage in the form of a magical
backlash. This damage may not be resisted.  An Adept may only have one
familiar at any one time. A familiar is not an enchanted creature.
The range of the summoning caused by this ritual is 1 mile (+1 /
Rank).

\begin{effects}
The Adept may read the tarot to gain insight and information.  The
Tarot may be used in one of four ways, and only one of these four
options may be chosen per reading. Once one of these options has been
successfully implemented, a new reading must be begun in order to
implement another.  There is no Backfire except as specifically
noted. The four options are:
\begin{Description}
\item[Divining Aspects] The Adept may use the Tarot to attempt to
  divine the Aspect or Aspects of an entity that is present for the
  entire ritual and within 5 feet (+1 / Rank).  The entity may
  actively but not passively resist the reading.  The Base Chance of
  the reading is 40\% and if successful, the Tarot will tell the Adept
  the entity’s basic Aspect (autumn air, lunar, death, etc), and
  whether the entity is light or dark aspected.  Failure will result
  in no sensible answer and Backfire in an incorrect reading.

\item[Divining Enchantment] The Adept may use the Tarot to attempt to
  determine if an entity or object is currently, or had been recently,
  under the effects of a spell. The object or entity must be present
  for the entire duration of the ritual, and be within 5 feet (+ 1 /
  Rank).  The ritual may not be resisted.  The Base Chance of the
  ritual being successful is 45\%.  The Base Chance is reduced by 5
  for every week or part thereof since the spell that is being divined
  was cast.  Permanent magic (e.g.  invested items still with charges)
  or spells currently in effect carry no modifier.  The Adept gains
  knowledge of those spells that fall within their cast chance.

  If the Adept can divine the spell, its exact name and college are
  revealed.  If the spell is non-colleged in origin, its general
  effects are revealed.

\item[Divining the Future] The Adept may use the Tarot to attempt to
  learn something about future events.  The Adept must decide on a
  question to be posed or a general course of action being considered
  before attempting this divination.  The GM may make the reading as
  simple or as complex as they desire, but in all cases the
  information gained should be vague.

  The Base Chance of successfully Divining the Future is 20\%.  If the
  Adept fails this option, the reading will be gibberish and obviously
  a failure, but if a Backfire occurs, a sensible but otherwise false,
  reading will be gained.

\item[Questioning the Dead] The Adept may attempt to communicate with
  the spirit of a deceased entity provided that they occupy the place
  that the entity died or was buried.  The Adept may only attempt this
  if they are aware that the place they occupy was the site of the
  entity’s death or burial.  The Base Chance of the spirit responding
  to the Adept’s questioning is 10\%. If the spirit responds the Adept
  may ask it questions and interpret its answers by turning over
  cards.  Only questions that can be answered with yes or no should be
  asked, and the spirit’s answer is indicated by the orientation of
  the card turned. The dead can only provide knowledge of events that
  transpired while they were alive.  Once the dead initially respond
  they will continue to answer all questions until dismissed, or the
  entire deck has been used.

\storage{Investment}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The spell increases the richness of the soil of 1 acre (+ 1 acre /
Rank). For the duration of the spell everything grown in that soil
will be proof against locusts, droughts, flooding, frost, and other
natural disasters.  This spell will also dissipate the effects of a
Spell of Blighting Crops which has previously been cast on the target
area of this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may mar or bless any unborn child whose mother is in sight
while she is pregnant. The Adept may increase or decrease any one
characteristic of the child by 1 (+ 1 per 3 or fraction Ranks).  This
spell may only be cast on the same unborn child more than once if it
is cast by different Adepts, and is used on different characteristics.
The spell may raise characteristics above normal racial maximums. If
cast so as to curse, it is a Major Curse and may only be removed
before the child is born. Note that if this spell is made into a
potion, the target of the spell is the imbiber.  The imbiber may only
passively resist the effects of the potion’s magic.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Blessing Livestock}

\range{Sight}
\duration{1 month + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{45\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Livestock}
\begin{effects}
The spell may be cast on up to 5 (+ 1 / Rank) livestock that are
within sight.  These animals will then be resistant to natural
disorders, such as rabies, dysentery, worms, and hoof and mouth
disease for the duration of the spell.  This spell will also dissipate
the effects of a Spell of Pestilence which has previously been cast on
the targets of the spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Blighting Crops}

\range{Sight}
\duration{1 year + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{45\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The spell causes 1 acre + 1 / Rank of land within sight to become sour
and lose fertility.  There is a 20\% (+ 1 / Rank ) chance of future
crops failing while this spell is in effect. Those years that the
crops do not fail, they will be stunted and approximately half a
normal yield will be obtained.  This spell is a minor curse.  This
spell will also dissipate the effects of a Spell of Blessing Crops
which has previously been cast on the target area of this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Cat Vision}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{60\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept causes the target to develop vision similar to that of a
cat.  Everything will appear monochromatic (i.e.  shades of grey) and
it is difficult to accurately estimate distance.  The higher the Rank,
the less of a problem this will be.  Some amount of light must be
present for this vision to operate. The range of the vision is 50 feet
(+ 10 / Rank).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Controlling Animals}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{ Concentration:  maximum  1  hour  +  1  / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Animal}
\begin{effects}
The Adept controls the actions of one normal and unenchanted animal,
bird or aquatic, that does not successfully resist.  The creature will
serve the Adept as long as they maintain their concentration.  If the
Adept chooses to release the animal or has their concentration broken,
the creature may attack them or flee.  The chance to cast this spell
is reduced by 5 if the Adept cannot Communicate with the creature.  If
the Adept cannot make eye contact, the Base Chance is also reduced by
5.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Converse With Animals}

\range{Self}
\duration{1 hour + 3 / Rank}
\multiple{50}
\basechance{60\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may communicate with any natural and unenchanted, animal,
bird, or aquatic.  Whether this communication is verbal or symbolic,
and to what extent the communication may be carried is left up to the
GM’s discretion. The Adept must specify at the time of casting what
particular type of animal, bird or aquatic is to be conversed
with. The spell must be re-cast to speak to another type of animal,
bird, or aquatic.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Creating Plague}

\range{15 feet}
\duration{1 day + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell infects any one target with any of 
the following diseases: 

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={m{4em}X}}
Rank	& Disease \\
0--5	& Measles \\
6--10	& Consumption \\
11--15	& Typhoid \\
16--18	& Bubonic Plague \\
19--20	& Pneumonic Plague \\
\end{dqtblr}

The target will not die of the disease, but will become habitually ill
and all who come in contact with them (except the Adept who cast the
spell) may contract a potentially fatal dose of the disease.  In
effect, the target becomes a carrier. This spell is a major curse.
Note that if this spell is made into a potion, the target of the spell
is the imbiber.  The imbiber may only passively resist the effects of
the potion’s magic.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Creating Restorative}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Water}
\begin{effects}
The spell creates out of drinkable water a potion which, when imbibed,
subtracts 2 from Endurance and repairs 4 lost Fatigue. The amount
subtracted from Endurance is increased by 1 and the amount of Fatigue
repaired is increased by 2 per Rank. The fatigue so restored may have
been lost through damage or tiredness, including spell casting.  The
potion will only restore lost Fatigue.  This spell can be prepared
in two ways:
\begin{Itemize}
\item The Adept can turn water into a restorative potion that will
  last 2 minutes (+2 / rank).

\item The Adept may spend an hour and burn oils costing 500sp to make
  a potion with the same effects that will last indefinitely.
\end{Itemize}

The effects of drinking the potion may be resisted.  The Endurance
damage caused by this potion may be healed by normal means.

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Damnum Magnatum}

\range{20 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{600}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Damnum Magnatum is a Major Curse and may take one of three forms,
as chosen by the Adept.  The Damnum Magnatum may normally only be
removed by the use of a Remove Curse Ritual, by a Counterspell cast by
the Adept that laid the curse, or by the death of the target.  This
spell may not be dissipated.

\begin{Description}
\item[Affliction] The Adept may choose to torment or kill their
  target.  If the effects of the Affliction are intended to be
  deadly, the target may not die as a result of the curse before (24 -
  Rank) hours have passed.  The Adept’s player states what the
  Affliction is to do, and then the exact effects and results must be
  decided by the GM.  In addition to the normal ways of lifting a
  curse, afflictions may have durations or conditions worded into
  them, in which case the curse is lifted when the duration expires or
  the condition is met.  Players should note that Afflictions are
  particularly capricious, and can never be relied upon to operate in
  precisely the same manner twice. Some sample Afflictions are:
\begin{Itemize}
\item Target begins to age at 10 years per day. Target may die of old
  age.  Once the curse is lifted the target will age backwards to
  their correct age, at the same rate.

\item Target contracts a deadly disease (including open running sores)
  that may not be cured by the arts of a Healer.

\item Target is transformed into a frog or other small creature (but
  retain their own mind). Condition: the Curse may be lifted by the
  kiss of a member of royalty of the opposite gender.

\item Target is cursed with Lycanthropy (random species).

\item Target will fall into a century long sleep (see Hibernation,
  College of Ice Magics S-6).
\end{Itemize}

\item[Ill Luck] Add two times the Rank of the Adept with this spell to
  any percentile dice roll involving the target’s use of their
  abilities.  This may never be applied favourably. Note that this is
  an addition to the dice roll, not a subtraction from Base Chances.

\item[Doom] A Doom is a pronouncement, by the Adept, upon an event
  that will occur in the target’s future, such as: “You will die by
  the hand of a loved one.”  The statement, which must be indefinite,
  will come true in not less than (24 - Rank) weeks. The Doom remains
  until it is fulfilled, and may not be removed by a Remove Curse
  Ritual, or even by the death of the target, unless that death
  fulfils the Doom.  The target is immediately aware of the nature of
  the Doom, and its wording. A Doom may be modified, so as to decrease
  the severity, make the time factor longer, etc., by the casting of a
  modified Doom on the same target, by an Adept with Rank in this
  spell at least equal to the Rank at which the original Doom was
  cast.  The exact effects of the Doom must be decided by the GM,
  and players should note that two Dooms, even if worded the same,
  need not have precisely the same effects.
\end{Description}
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Earth Tremor}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{5 seconds + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
By the use of this spell the Adept causes the very earth to pitch and
roll uncontrollably as though in a tremendous earthquake.  The area
that may be affected is a one hex area of ground (+ 1 / Rank). Any
Entities within the Area must roll less than or equal to 1 × AG to
retain their footing.

Those who fail to remain standing fall prone im-mediately and may not
rise for the duration of the tremor. Objects within the Area will tend
to topple and roll around. If the spell is cast under part of, or all
of, a building, wall, or other such construction, significant
structural damage will occur, probably causing partial or total
collapse.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-12]{Hex}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 day + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
By use of this spell, the Adept curses the target with ill-fortune.
Unless the target resists, all their Base Chances, Strike Chances, and
their Magic Resistance are reduced by the Rank of the spell (1 if
unranked). This spell is a minor curse.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-13]{Hellfire}

\range{10 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{650}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This sulphurous fire attacks 1 human-sized target for every 3 (or
fraction) Ranks. The target’s Magical Resistance is reduced by 5 (+ 1
/ Rank).  The spell does D10 (+ 2 / Rank) damage to each target.  If a
target successfully resists, they suffer only half damage (round up).
Double damage add an additional 1 / Rank damage and triple damage adds
an additional 2 / Rank damage.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-14]{Instilling Flight}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Concentration:  maximum  30  minutes  + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell enables the Adept to instil a possession of up to 5 lbs (+5
/ Rank) with the power of flight.  The spell will dissipate if the
object stops being a possession of the Adept, the Adept loses
concentration, or if the object is broken.  The Adept may cause the
object to fly at 20 miles per hour (+ 2 / Rank).  It will take off and
accelerate up to full speed, or halt and land, in a single pulse. The
object may support 150 lbs (+ 50 / Rank) in addition to its own
weight.  Naturally flexible or fragile items gain sufficient strength
and rigidity to support the load.  Any object or entity that falls
from the flying object will move off in a random direction.  If the
object is about to crash into a surface, it will attempt to land,
although some surfaces may be inappropriate for this (lava, sheer
walls, etc.).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-15]{Mass Fear}

\range{10 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{30 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The spell instills in all entities within range, other than the Adept,
and those who successfully resist, an unreasoning and uncontrollable
fear.  All entities that fail to resist must roll on the Fright Table
(see \S\ref{table:fright}).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-16]{Pestilence}

\range{Sight}
\duration{1 month + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{45\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Livestock}
\begin{effects}
The spell may be cast on up to 5 (+ 1 / Rank) livestock that are
within sight. All livestock so cursed that do not resist
(individually) are infected (see \S\ref{health:infection}). Any new
stock which comes into contact with the infected stock while the curse
is in effect must also resist (individually) or become infected.  This
spell is a minor curse on each individual. This spell will also
dissipate the effects of a Spell of Blessing Livestock which has
previously been cast on the targets of this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-17]{Skin Change}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Until dispelled by the appropriate counterspell}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Special}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may enchant an animal pelt or skin so that anyone who
touches, or is touched by the “inside” will turn into the type of
animal to whom the pelt originally belonged, but will retain their own
mind and memories.  The spell is, in effect, stored in the pelt or
skin, and may be retained unused for an length of time dependent
upon the Rank of the spell:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={m{4em}X}}
Rank	& Duration \\
0--6	& 1 week (+ 1 / Rank) \\
7--12	& 2 weeks (+ 2 / Rank) \\
13–19	& 1 month (+ 1 / Rank) \\
20	& permanent until used \\
\end{dqtblr}

The wearer of the pelt may only resume their own form by having the
Special Knowledge Counterspell of the College of Witchcraft cast over
them.  The pelt is destroyed by the process of returning the wearer to
their original form. This spell may be used to enchant the pelts or
skins of sentient entities, but if used for that purpose its Base
Chance is reduced by 20\%.  Note that if a backfire result is achieved
when casting this spell, the pelt or skin is destroyed in addition to
any other backfire effects.  The Skin Change spell itself may be
stored by Investment (so that it may later be triggered on a pelt) but
not by other means. The “inside” of a pelt is the side that was
closest to the animal’s body.

The skin must be applied to the target for at least 30 seconds before
they will change, where upon the target gets to resist its effects.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-18]{Virility}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{2 hours + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap, Potion}
\target{Male Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell is cast over a male entity and greatly increases the
target’s virility.  In addition the chance of the target’s female
partner conceiving is increased by 5 (+ 5 / Rank). Note that if this
spell is made into a potion, the target of the spell is the imbiber.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-19]{Wall of Thorns}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept causes a wall of tangled briars and thorns to spring forth
from the ground.  The wall is 10 feet high × 20 feet long × 2 feet
thick.  The Adept may increase the length or height by 1 foot per
Rank. The wall may not be cast on top of an entity. A human-sized hole
may be made in the wall by causing 20 points of damage in one area.
This damage need not come from a single attack.  All “A” class weapons
and most “C” class will have little effect on the tough springy vines.
An entity forcibly pressed against the wall, or attempting to force
their way through it will suffer [D + 2] damage for every Pulse they
are so engaged.  This damage is entirely physical, and armour may
protect against it.  An entity can normally force its way through the
wall in 6 Pulses.  The wall is very dense, and may not be seen
through.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\section{Special Knowledge Rituals}

\resist{None}
\target{Area}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{None}
\actions{Dance} 
\concentration{None} 
\begin{effects}
The Adept may change one or more of the three components that make up
the weather by performing a ritual dance. The three components of
weather are: Precipitation / Cloud Cover, Temperature, and Wind.  The
GM should consult the Weather Table and advise the player of the
current level of each of the three components before they start
dancing.  The Adept may change one component by Rank / 2 (round down),
or two components by Rank / 3 (round down) levels each, or all three
components by Rank / 4 (round down) levels each.  The changes are
independent and may be in any direction.  The weather will change
gradually over 30 minutes (l / Rank) per level shifted, and all three
components will change simultaneously.  The area of the effect is
circular and the diameter is 2 miles / Rank (minimum 2). This ritual
counts as Strenuous activity and the Adept will lose Fatigue. This
ritual may not Backfire.

\resist{Special}
\target{Entity}
\casttime{2 hour}
\material{13 bones}
\actions{Carving bones}
\concentration{None}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates 13 Rune-bones by carving the appropriate
maledictions into bones from an entity of the same race as the
target. The Adept then buries the bones beneath the dwelling of the
entity that they wish to curse.  It is best if the victim’s name is
carved in the bones as well.  If the intended victim’s name is not
carved on the bones, and there are 1 or more other entities inhabiting
the dwelling, there is a 20\% (- 1 per Rank) chance that the curse
will settle on someone other than the intended victim.  For each month
that the bones remain in or under the victim’s dwelling, they must
make a Resistance Check, the Base Chance for which is composed of the
victim’s Endurance multiplied by the Difficulty Multiplier of the
resistance. The Difficulty Ratings are:

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={m{4em}X}}
Rank	& Multiplier \\
0--5	& 4.0 \\
6--10	& 3.0 \\
11--15	& 2.5 \\
16-–18	& 2.0 \\
19-–20	& 1.5 \\
\end{dqtblr}

If the victim fails to resist, they suffer a wasting disease and lose
[D - 4] Endurance for purposes of future resistance (only).  If they
fail to resist for three straight months they die.

\begin{effects}
By means of this ritual the Adept creates an horrific and evil candle.
Only the darkest of the Wicca would ever perform this Ritual.  The
Adept makes a Dead Man’s candle by severing the left hand of a
convicted murderer who has been hung.  The hand must be severed during
a full moon and wrapped in a burial shroud. It must then be dried in
the sun until desiccated. The Adept must render the fats and oils from
the body of a stillborn baby, so that the hand can be coated with them
and a candle made.  The wick of the candle is then made from the hair
of the same murderer.  The Adept says words of darkest power over the
candle.  Thereafter, it may be lit as part of any spell or ritual of
this College and will increase the chance that the spell or ritual is
successful by 20, provided that the ritual is being performed with
malign intent.  This Ritual may not be Ranked, and it always works, if
it is correctly performed.  A Dead Man’s Candle will burn for about 10
hours before it is no longer usable, and may be extinguished and relit
an indefinite number of times.

This gruesome ritual creates an amulet of great and malign potency.
Many Wicca consider this ritual to be evil and it would certainly
never be studied or performed by a “White Mage”.  To successfully
perform the ritual, the Adept must sever the right hand of a convicted
murderer who has been hung.  The hand may only be severed during the
new moon and must be wrapped in a winding sheet. It must then be dried
in the sun and the blood entirely removed.  When the desiccated hand
is worn as an amulet, thereafter, it will subtract 10 from the Cast
Check of creating any Plague, Blight, or Curse.  This Ritual may not
be Ranked, and it always works if it is correctly performed.
