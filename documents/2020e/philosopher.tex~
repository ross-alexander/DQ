\begin{Chapter}{Philosopher (Ver 2.0)}

Philosophers  become  familiar  with  the  general 
characteristics  of  their  world,  within  the  limits  of 
the knowledge available to their culture, discarding 
many popular misconceptions. They acquire exten-
sive  knowledge  on  a  wide  range  of  subjects,  and 
are,  in  many  ways,  the  encyclopaedias  and  expert 
opinions  of  the  medieval  world.  Philosophers  are 
also  well  versed  in  using  the  unusual  and  obscure 
indexing  methods  employed  in  medieval  libraries, 
and so may research and answer enquiries that they 
do not immediately know the answers to. 

44.1 Library 
Any  place  with  50  or  more  books  may  be  consid-
ered  a  library,  for  the  purposes  of  study.  Libraries 
are rated for the number of days that a philosopher 
may  study  in  them  to  answer  any  particular  ques-
tion. This rating is usually  equal to Books divided 
by 50. Once a philosopher has exhausted the possi-
bilities  of  a  library  they  must  either  find  another 
and  continue  their  study  or  attempt  to  answer  the 
question anyway. A day of study is 10 hours, and is 
full-time work. Some libraries with specific collec-
tions  may  be  rated  higher  for  some  Realms  than 
others. GMs should bear in mind that the books in 
some  libraries  will  be  predominately  in  particular 
languages, and that if the philosopher is not literate 
in  those  languages,  the  library  may  be  of  reduced 
usefulness. 

44.2 Requirements 

Language restriction 

A  character  may  not  become  a  philosopher  unless 
they  possess  at  least  one  language  at  Rank  8,  and 
are literate in that language. 

Books 

A  philosopher  must  possess  (or  have  frequent 
access to) at least Rank times 10 books, written in 
languages that they are literate in. 

44.3 Structure 
The  philosopher  skill  is  designed  as  a  tree-like 
structure,  with  several  separate  Realms  of  knowl-
edge,  each  of  which  has  its  own  Fields,  which  in 
turn, have Sub-fields. 

Realms 

These are the largest and least detailed divisions of 
knowledge. There are 5 Realms of knowledge: the 
Social  World,  the  Material  World,  the  Magical 
World, the Animal World, and the Plant World. 

Fields 

Realms are divided into large blocks of knowledge, 
called  Fields.  GMs  should  not  need  to  add  new 
Fields to the Realms, but may do so if they wish. 

Sub-fields 

Small, and quite specific divisions of a Field, these 
are  not  limited  to  only  those  suggested  below.  A 
philosopher may learn almost any sub-division of a 
Field as a Sub-field, with the GM as the final arbi-
ter.  The  most  common  Sub-fields  concern  a  par-
ticular race or area within a Field. 

44.4 Language Benefits 
Philosophers  gain  a  reduction  in  the  EP  costs  to 
learn languages, in addition to any other reductions 
available to the character. 

Provided that the Rank of language  being learnt is 
not  greater  than  their  Rank  of  philosopher,  phi-
losophers  may  learn  to  speak  the  language  or  to 
read  an  orthographic  language  at  a  10%  discount. 
If the philosopher has chosen the Field of Linguis-
tics, the discount is 20% instead, increasing to 30% 
if the philosopher has chosen the appropriate Lan-
guage Group subfield (see §44.3). 

44.5 Knowledge Benefits 

Realms 

At Ranks 0, 4, 7, and 10, the philosopher may learn 
a  Realm  of  knowledge.  Each  Realm  provides  a 
thorough grounding in the basics associated with it 

(see  the  individual  Realms  for  more  details).  If  a 
philosopher  wishes  to  forego  learning  a  Realm, 
they  receive  an  extra  8  Sub-fields  (which  may  be 
traded for Fields as below). 

Fields & Sub-fields 

At  each  Rank  above  0,  the  philosopher  receives  a 
number  of  Sub-fields.  They  receive:  at Ranks 1 to 
4, 3  Sub-fields;  at Ranks 5  to 7, 5  Sub-fields; and 
at Ranks 8 to 10, 7 Sub-fields. 

3 Sub-fields may be traded for 1 Field. Any part of 
the Subfield allotment may be retained and used in 
conjunction with the allotment received for further 
Ranks.  Once  a  philosopher  has  achieved  Rank  10 
they  may  not  Rank  their  Skill  further,  but  may 
acquire  new  areas  of  knowledge.  A  new  Realm 
costs  8  weeks  and  4000ep,  a  new  Field  3  weeks 
and  1500ep,  and  a  new  Sub-field  1  week  and 
500ep. 

Field Restrictions 

A  philosopher  may  not  learn  a  Sub-field  if  they 
have not already learned the Field that it is part of. 
They may not learn a Field if they have not already 
learned the Realm that it is part of. 

no adverse effects. If the interruption is longer than 
this,  then  half  of  the  percentage  amount  that  they 
had achieved from study is lost. 

Final Result 

If the question is of a  yes/no nature, the Accuracy 
is the Base Chance that the philosopher will arrive 
at the correct answer. If the question is more open, 
the Accuracy is the amount of relevant information 
that  the  philosopher  will  come  up  with.  It  is  also 
possible that some questions (as determined by the 
GM)  are  simply  unanswerable.  If  this  is  the  case, 
the  Accuracy  becomes  the  Base  Chance  that  the 
philosopher will become aware of this fact. 

44.7 Realms & Fields 
Each of the five Realms is listed below, along with 
its  associated  Fields.  Some  Fields  are  followed  by 
a list of suggested Sub-fields. 

The Social World 

Standard  Sub-fields  include:  Area,  Race,  History. 
The Fields of this Realm are:  

• Art & Music — Style  

• Ethnology  

Overlaps & Connections 

• Heraldry & Genealogy — Tinctures, Furs  

In some cases it is possible to reach the same Sub-
fields  by  different  routes.  These  duplicated  Fields 
may  be  treated  as  identical  and no  benefit  accrues 
from having the same Subfield more than once. 

44.6 Research Benefits 
Philosophers  may  attempt  to  answer  questions  put 
to  them.  These  questions  may  be  posed  by  them-
selves,  or  by  other  characters.  If  the  philosopher 
does not already know the answer, their chance of 
success  depends  on  the  difficulty  of  the  question 
and the relevant Realms and Fields of the philoso-
pher. 

Difficulty 

Questions  that  may  be  answered  by  a  philosopher 
fall  into  one  of  seven  categories:  Automatic,  Very 
Easy,  Easy,  Standard,  Hard,  Very  Hard,  and  Im-
possible. The first step in determining the difficulty 
of  answering  the  question  is  for  the  GM  to  deter-
mine which Realm(s) the question pertains to, and 
the level of difficulty of the question. 

A  Standard  question  is  one  of  average  difficulty, 
relative  to  a  given  Realm,  as  determined  by  the 
GM.  They  usually  deal  with  a  reasonably  large 
sub-set of the knowledge of the Realm.  If the phi-
losopher  possesses  the  Realm  to  which  the  ques-
tion pertains, but has no more in-depth knowledge 
applicable to the question, the difficulty is as set by 
the  GM.  If  the  philosopher  has  a  Field  within  that 
Realm  that  the  GM  determines  is  relevant  to  the 
question, the difficulty decreases by one step. If the 
philosopher  has  a  Sub-field  within  that  Field,  and 
the  GM  determines  that  it  is  relevant  to  the  ques-
tion,  the  difficulty  decreases  by  another  step.  If  a 
philosopher does not even possess the Realm of the 
question,  it  becomes  two  steps  harder.  A  philoso-
pher  will  immediately  know  the  answer  to  an 
Automatic question. A philosopher may not answer 
an Impossible question. 

Answers 

The accuracy of the answer that a philosopher can 
offer is dependent on Rank and the difficulty of the 
question. To increase their accuracy, a philosopher 
may  also  undertake  a  course  of  study.  For  each 
study period (the length of which is determined by 
difficulty), +1% is added to the philosopher’s Base 
Chance. A philosopher may, at any time, attempt to 
answer  the  question.  The  base  Accuracy,  Rank 
bonus, and length of study period is  shown on the 
Answer Table (§44.8). 

Even  though  philosophers  keep  notes  during  their 
course  of  study,  an  extended  interruption  may 
prove a setback. If a philosopher ceases a course of 
study  but  resumes  it  within  Rank  weeks  there  are
