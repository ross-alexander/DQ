\begin{Chapter}{Warrior (Ver 3.0)}

Warriors  train  in  advanced  combat  and  weapon 
techniques,  and  practice  the  art  of  melee  combat 
until  it  becomes  a  series  of  finely  honed  instincts. 
They  practise  on  all  terrains  with  all  types  of 
weapons  against  different  configurations  and  tac-
tics,  so  that  they  may  always  respond  optimally 
without the need for thought. 

Warriors usually join and train within one Warrior 
Guild  (or  school),  most  guilds  are  exclusive  and 
will  not  train  those  of  other  guilds,  many  have 
strong  ethical  codes  such  as  Chivalry  and  training 
is  often  only  available  after  indoctrination  in  the 
code. 

49.1 Restrictions 
A  Warrior  may  never  train  in  the  Warrior  skill 
without a training partner of at least equal Warrior 
rank. 

Assassin teaches a method of fighting that does not 
stack  with  Warrior.  The  benefits  of  Warrior  OR 
Assassin (not both) may be applied to any specific 
attack or defence. 

A  Warrior  must have  at  least 3  weapons  at  rank 4 
or  higher  including  1  melee  rated  weapon  and  1 
close rated weapon. 

A  Warrior  requires  various  minimum  weapons 
skills  per  Rank.  Before  being  able  to  achieve  any 
new  Rank  in  the  warrior  skill,  a  Warrior  must 
achieve the Ranks summarised in table 49.5 below. 

49.2 Benefits 

A  Warrior  gains  a  bonus  to  defence  in  melee 
and close combat of 2% (+2% per rank). 

When  using  ranked  melee  or  close  rated  weap-
ons,  or  weapons  from  a  category  where  they 
have a higher ranked weapon, a Warrior: 

 

 
 
 

gains  +1  Engaged  IV  per  rank  (no  benefit  at 
rank 0) 
gains +2% (+2% per rank) to Strike Chance 
gains +1 damage at ranks 5 \& 10 
gains +1 effective weapon rank for the Parry 
Calculation at ranks 4 \& 8. 

For categories where the Warrior has a ranked 
weapon, they: 

  may  use  any  weapon  from  the  category  at 
half  the  Rank  of  their  maximum  Ranked 
weapon  in  that  category  or  at  half  their  war-
rior Rank, whichever is lower. 

  may Rank weapons in the category without a

is treated as a merchant of their warrior Rank 
when attempting to buy or value non-magical 

weapons, with which they have ranks. If they 
have  a  passing  familiarity  with  the  weapon 
(i.e.  has  Ranks  in  the  same  category  but  not 
the  actual  weapon)  they  will  act  as  a  mer-
chant of half their warrior Rank. 

A Rank 5 Warrior may start to acquire Warrior 
Special Abilities.  

While  some  abilities  are  general  combat  abilities 
and only need to be learned once, most are weapon 
specific  and  must  be  learned  once  per  weapon.  A 
warrior gains one special ability at ranks 5, 6, & 7, 
two at ranks 8, 9, & 10.  

Additional  special  abilities  may  be  gained  without 
increasing  in  rank  by  the  expenditure  of  10,000 
Experience  Points  and  8  weeks  of  training  per 
ability.  These  costs  are  discounted  by  25%  if  the 
warrior has reached rank 8, or by 50% if they have 
reached rank 10.
