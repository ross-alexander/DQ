\begin{Chapter}{Languages (Ver 2.1)}

The campaign has many languages.  Each sentient race usually has one
language intrinsic to itself, or more if that race is split into
various populations.  There is no universal language, but Common is
the first language of several nations.

\section{Restrictions}

A language may not be known above its maximum rank. Characters may not
speak a tongue for which they do not have the vocal apparatus.
Characters may not learn a language without instruction from a source
of at least the same rank as that being learnt.

\section{Structure}
Family Each language belongs to one particular Family of intrinsically
related tongues (see §39.6).

Group History, geography, and custom all transform languages.
Languages with a common history or interaction share the same language
Group (see §39.7). A language may belong to several Groups, and a
Group may link languages from different Families.

Learning a language is easier if one already knows a related or
similar language at a higher rank. The EP discount is:

• 20\% if in the same Family or Group,  

•  30\%  if  in  both  the  same  Group  and  the  same 
Family. 

\section{Benefits}

Languages vary in their complexity; a low maximum rank may indicates
less versatility, vocabulary, or foreignisms.

At  Rank  0 in a  language,  you  cannot  speak it, but 
can usually  sense  the  general  mood  of  plain  state-
ments:  a  threat,  a  greeting,  etc.  Thereafter,  with 
increasing  rank,  your  competency  and  vocabulary 
progressively  increase,  as  compared  to  humans 
using  a  typical  human  language  to  talk  about  eve-
ryday things in their village.

Note  that  some  languages  are  very  limited.  For 
example,  many  concepts  or  emotions  cannot  be 
articulated in Troll. 

39.4 Literacy 
Literacy  in  a  language  is  distinct  from  the  skill  of 
speaking.  It  is  easily  learnt  if  the  written  form  is 
alphabetic.  Most  cultures  have  a  large  proportion 
of the population that is illiterate. 

Not  all  languages  have  a  written  form.  It  is  not 
possible  to  attain  literacy  in  a  language  that  does 
not  have  an  established  written  form.  One  may 
attempt  to  transcribe  that  language,  adapting  a 
known  script,  but  the  “writing”  produced  is  inef-
fectual for communicating with others. 

Phonetic Reading & Writing 

Most  Alusian  languages  are  written  using  a  pho-
netic  alphabet  —  a  set  of  signs  representing,  one-
to-one,  all  the  sounds  of  that  language.  Histori-
cally, a recently literate language usually re-uses an 
established  alphabet  with  minor  variations.  There-
fore there are many languages, but few alphabets. 

For each alphabet, the cost is 1000 EP and 4 weeks 
the first time you learn literacy using it; literacy in 
a subsequent language, using the same alphabet, is 
only 500 EP and 2 weeks. Sometimes, for different 
cultures,  one  language  is  written  in  different  pho-
netic  alphabets.  If  so,  you  must  pay  the  time  and 
EP for each one you learn. 

Table of known Alusian alphabets 

b   Bedouin script (human, flowing, cursive). 

d   Drakonic. 

e  

i  

Elvish script. 

Island (used near the land-locked ocean). 

k   Kingdom (used near the Azurian Empire). 

m   Mer (suited to underwater use) 

n   Nagan (elaborate, but versatile).  

o   Ogham (human, rune-like). 

r   Dwarvish runes. 

w   Westron (usual Western human alphabet, also 

adopted by many newly literate societies). 

Orthographic languages 

A  literate  language  not  using  a  truly  phonetic  al-
phabet  is  orthographic  (e.g.  it  uses  pictograms,  or 
an elaborate spelling structure). The written form is 
so complex that it must be learned as if it were, in 
effect,  another  language  of  the  same  language 
family  (e.g.  written  and  spoken  Erehleine  are 
treated as two separate members of the Eldar Fam-
ily).  Hence  one  often  speaks  and  writes  an  ortho-
graphic  language  at  different  ranks.  Orthographic 
languages are indicated in §39.6 by an asterisk (*). 
Each orthographic system is functionally unique to 
its particular language. 

39.5 Special Rules 
Common  It is easy to learn Common. Knowledge 
of any other language at a higher rank gives a 50% 
EP discount. 

Accent Every speaker has an accent which reflects 
a  mixture  of  their  native  language  and  the  tutors 
from whom they learnt the language. At Rank 6 or 
higher, any speaker may gain a particular accent by 
spending 500 EP and 1–3 weeks studying or being 
tutored  (the  GM  decrees  how  much  time  is neces-
sary). 

Unpronounceable  Tongues  All  languages  of  the 
Dragon  Family  (except  Saurime)  require  unusual 
vocal  apparatus.  No  humanoid  race  may  normally 
speak  these  tongues.  However,  you  may  rank  the 
language at twice normal cost, to gain comprehen-
sion.  Alphabetic  literacy  in  an  unpronounceable 
language  costs  2000  EP  and  8  weeks.  If  you  do 
have  the  physiological  or  magical  ability  to  speak 
such  languages,  you  may  rank  them  without  pen-
alty. 

Immersion If character spends a number of weeks 
listening  to  a  particular  language  being  spoken 
daily  and  frequently  by  speakers  who  use  it  at  a 
rank  higher  than  the  character  knows  it,  the  GM 
may  allow  that  character  to  use  those  weeks  as 
ranking  time  for  that  language  in  addition  to  any 
other activity undertaken (e.g. going on adventure, 
other  training,  etc).  The  EP  must  still  be  paid.  A 
character  may  only  rank  one  language  by  immer-
sion at any one time. 

39.6 Language Families 
The figure within [ ] represents the maximum rank 
that can be achieved with the language; the letter(s) 
represent  the  phonetic  alphabet(s)  used,  and  * 
identifies  orthographic  languages.  If  no  letter  or 
asterisk  is  given,  the  language  does  not  have  an 
established written form.

\subsection{New  Languages}

When a new language is introduced into the campaign, the GM concerned
must determine the following:

1. Family and any language Groups. 

2.  Written  forms,  if  any.  Are  they  phonetic  or 
orthographic? If alphabetic, what alphabet is used? 

3. Its maximum rank.
