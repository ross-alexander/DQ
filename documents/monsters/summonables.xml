<dqmm><group name="Summonables"><notes>This section includes those entities which normally do not appear on
this plane, but are summonable from their own dimension.  These
entities include: demons, devils, djinni, efreeti, elementals (earth,
air, fire and water), hellhounds, imps, incubi, and succubi.  Devils,
demons, imps, incubi, and succubi are described in the College of
Greater Summonings which is concerned exclusively with the summoning
and control of these entities.  The other summonable entities are
described in this section.

Generally, an entity summoned from another dimension will require from
1 to 10 Pulses (5 to 50 seconds) to materialise once summoned.  In
some cases, entities appear in a non-corporeal form and must be
commanded to take on substantial form.  An insubstantial entity has no
power on this plane, but cannot be harmed. An entity in substantial
form, however, can be harmed and can harm others.

</notes><monster name="Djinn"><details><habitat>  Other Planes</habitat><frequency> Very Rare</frequency><number> 1
</number><description> A djinn is a male humanoid about ten feet tall, with
darkly tanned skin and a black beard.
</description><talents> A djinn has all the abilities of an air elemental summoned
by a magician with Rank 8 in the Ritual of Summoning Air Elementals.
In addition, a djinn can create matter weighing up to 200 pounds.
This ability can be used once per day.  The material created will have
varying permanence, depending upon its solidity. Wood, cloth and other
light materials will last for as long as a week, while steel, gold, or
other hard substances will last only for hours. Djinni cannot be
harmed by non-magical weapons.
</talents><weapons> Djinni prefer large, curved weapons, with a double-sized
scimitar being the weapon most commonly used. Add 10 to the Base
Chance of any weapon a djinn uses, and double damage done because of
its size. A djinn will have Rank 4 or better with a scimitar.

anything suicidal. Having a djinn in a party can occasionally cause
problems because other creatures, such as efreeti (who are deadly
enemies of the djinni) will be attracted to the party.</comments></monster><monster name="Efreet"><details><habitat>  Other Planes</habitat><frequency> Very Rare</frequency><number> 1

this plane. They are humanoid in form, about 12 feet tall, and their
dark-brown skin flickers as if it were about to burst into flame at

</description><talents> An efreet has all the talents and abilities of a fire
elemental summoned at Rank 12. In addition an efreet can grant three

invisible at will. Efreeti cannot be harmed by non-magical attacks.
</talents><weapons>  Efreeti use edged weapons of ordinary shape but
twice normal size and weight. Improve the weapon's Base

</na></stats><comments> If discovered on this plane, an efreet will either be in
the service of some character, or trapped in a sealable container,
such as a bottle. If the latter is the case and the finder of the
efreet releases it from its captivity, there is a 95% chance that the
efreet will serve him willingly. The other 5% of the time the efreet
will attack. If the efreet decides to serve, it will either grant
three wishes, or become the character's slave for a period of 1001
days (at the liberator's option). If three wishes are chosen, they
must be used by the end of the day on which the efreet was released.
If service is chosen, the efreet will perform any task asked of it
that is not obviously suicidal. If a request involves physical danger
to the efreet is made of the efreet, there is a 10% chance (+10 for
each additional request) that the efreet will rebel against its master
and attack him.  Efreeti are creatures of fire, and thus they will not
go to or be found in frigid climates or underwater.

bat's wings and barbed tails.  They tend to be muscular, but

red.  They have yellow eyes, flecked with silver and their teeth
(including prominent incisors) are made of silver.  Imps may also
appear as goats, spiders, bats or large rats, but these are
insubstantial forms. The imp cannot use his powers in this plane
except in his natural and substantial form.
</description><talents>Imps may be members of any Colleges of Magic except the Entities as
determined by the GM.  Imps can only be harmed by silvered weapons or
magic. Cold iron does not affect them.  They have no skills.  They
have Rank 5 with all magic.
</talents><weapons>Imps may make a horn attack during Close Combat with a Base Chance of
20% and possible damage of [D − 1].  Imp horns may have a Rank
of between 1 and 10 (controlling Player should roll D10 to determine
Rank).  Imps may also make an attack in either Melee or Close Combat
with their long tail. Its tip contains a sting with a quick acting
nerve poison (2--4 Damage Points per Pulse). The sting itself is
treated like a dagger.  Base Chance with tail is 30%.  Imps may
use other weapons, but may not wear armour.

of humour which they are not averse to visiting upon their master and
friends.  They may not be bound or forced to speak true, so there is
no way to really control their actions.  They will lie, steal, sow
dissension, or play practical jokes (magical or non-magical) on the
average once per day (total).  They will not knowingly get their
master killed or maimed but are otherwise not overly considerate of
the master's wellbeing.  They will use their powers on the master's
behalf when it is demanded of them (though even here their sense of
humour may have an effect) and will fight the master's enemies.  Imps
may be called upon as needed and then returned to their own dimension.
Given their warped personalities, the wise master will keep them in
their own dimension as much as possible.  Imps have a 7% Base
Chance of knowing past, present and future events, but will seldom
speak truthfully of what they know.

Half-Devils, when on this plane, can appear to be an animal but cannot

rituals not intrinsic to their college.</talents><weapons>Half-Devils may make a Horn attack or a Bite as well as Sting with
their tail in Close Combat.  They may use their Tail in Melee but at

Charge).  Both can be rank 1 to 5. Their Tail has a Base Chance of

that does 2 damage points per pulse. (Poison effects are not
cumulative.)  The victim can resist the effects of the poison by
rolling under normal endurance when fatigue has been removed, or by
rolling under twice normal endurance when their endurance is reduced
to 3 or less.  A Half-Devil's tail is always rank 4.  A Half-Devil may
use weapons (unranked), but will never wear armour.

familiar to the adept.  This familiar is a Half-Devil.  The GM should
randomly roll the values of the above stats and then roll on the
following table for the college.

1 E [amp] E
2 Mind

The adept may choose the location of the witchmark and a ritual
drawing blood binds the Half-Devil to that adept.  The Half- Devil
will then always aim to please his master (although his understanding
of the world may hamper this) but will severely dislike (and hope to
avoid) any period of separation from the adept.  Should the adept or
familiar die, the bond is broken and the Half-Devil will immediately
return to the seventh plane (where the adept may pick it up later if
it was s/he that died).  If the Half-Devil dies, a new one may be
issued 5 years after the previous one was issued.  Half-Devils, during
ritual blood-letting, immediately acquire all spoken languages that
the adept knows at one less rank.  Half-Devils cannot read or write.
Half-Devils have no other skills, although in their animal form they
may have abilities, eg.  a weasel can stare down basilisks.  Note that
the familiar loses one fatigue per hour that it doesn't feed
(irrelevant of form).  Hence, the adept must feed it at least once a
day (using four fatigue which the Half-Devil enjoys (obviously).  In
animal or the Half-Devil can understand the languages it understands
in natural form, but cannot speak back.

be harmed except by magic or by the touch of the Book of Toth, an
ancient tome of magical lore found only in older and seldom frequented

damaged by attacks involving that opposite. Water and fire are
opposite members, as are earth and air.  An elemental's Endurance,
Fatigue, and Strength vary according to it summoner's Rank with the
