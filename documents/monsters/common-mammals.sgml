<class name="Apes and Prehumans">

<notes>
Apes and prehumans include baboons, gorillas, and orang-outangs in
addition to two classes of prehumans: neanderthals and sasquatchs. All
of these tend to be shy of humans and will usually dwell in high
mountains or deep jungle.  They have three times the stealth of an
average human (30) and are often adept at tracking and have other
talents sometimes associated with the Ranger Skill.

<monster name="Baboon">
<details>
<habitat> Plains
<frequency> Common
<number> 1-100 (2)
<description> Baboons are medium-sized apes, usually no more than 4
feet tall, and 120 pounds in weight. They are characterized by their
large heads and long sharp fangs.  Baboons generally have light brown
fur, but may have brightly coloured (orange, blue, purple or red)
faces and/or rumps (especially females).

<talents> Baboons possess no special talents or skills. They are
neither magic nor tool users and are only semi-intelligent.

<weapons> Baboons cannot attack except in Close Combat.  They will
swarm over their victim, using their bite (Base Chance of 65&percnt,
Damage of +4) to kill by increasing blood loss.  Comments: Baboons
tend to be vicious and unpredictable, attacking without warning. They
are tribal in nature and do not fear men when in company with the rest
of the tribe.  They can sometimes (30&percnt chance) be assuaged by
food (usually meat).

<frequency> Rare
<number> 1-40 (20)
<description> Gorillas reach 650 pounds and 6+ feet in height.  They
usually have arm spans when full grown of over 10 feet.  Gorillas tend
to have black fur, but older males will often have gray or silver
fur. Some species are entirely white.  Both males and females have
prominant canines and are vicious fighters.  Due to their great
weight, gorillas cannot move between trees in the manner of other
apes.

<talents> Gorillas have no special talents or skills. They are not
tool or magic users.

<weapons> Gorillas may only attack via Close Combat.  However, they
may enter Close Combat with an entity whose combined modified Agility
and Physical Strength is half or less their own by grabbing the victim
and pulling him into their hex.  This maneuver requires a Charge
Action and is implemented in the same manner (except that the victim
is pulled out of his hex into the gorilla's.  Gorillas may bite (Base
Chance of 30&percnt, [D - 2] Damage) or rend (Base Chance of
50&percnt, [D + 6] Damage) in Close Combat, but not in the same pulse.

weapons more complicated than stones and clubs.

<weapons> Neanderthals will use rocks and sticks and sometimes simple
clubs and axes.  They will rarely (15&percnt) pick up and use a dropped
weapon of a more complex nature.  They will be at a total loss to
figure out the workings of such complex weapons as bows.  They have
prominent canines and will always attempt to enter Close Combat where

two. If the latter is in the case, the camel is called a dromedary.

<talents> Camels'metabolisms allow them to retain large quantities of

<talents> Dingoes have no special talents or skills and do not use
magic or tools.

<weapons> Dingoes may bite in Close Combat with a Base Chance of
65&percnt of doing [D - 4] Damage. They may not otherwise attack.

<comments> Dingoes hunt in packs. They will usually refrain from
attacking humanoids unless they catch an individual alone and are
hungry. They can be rapped and the pups are trainable, but they cannot
be sold to an individual who was not present at their training.

<monster name="Hyena">

<details><habitat> Plains
<frequency> Common Common
<number> 1-10 (6)
<description> Hyenas are light brown, snub-snouted animals about 4
feet in length. Their hides are specked with large dark brown
rings. They have short tails and rounded ears. The forelegs of a hyena
are longer than the rear legs, so when the animal stands, it seems to
slope downward from its shoulders to its tail.  At night, hyenas can
be recognized by their barking howl.

<talents> Hyena have no special talents or skills. They do not use
tools or magic.

<weapons> Hyenas can only attack in Close Combat and then they bite
with a Base Chance of 60&percnt of doing [D - 1] damage.

<monster name="Jackal">

<description> A jackal looks like a cross between a fox and a wolf,
has a speckled grey and brown coat, and is about 3 feet long.

<talents> A jackal has no special talents or skills and does not use
tools or magic.

<weapons> Jackals can only attack in Close Combat. Their bite has a
Base Chance of 60&percnt of doing [D - 2] damage.

<comments> Jackals, like hyenas, are scavengers, and are none too
courageous. They are curious, and will occasionally raid a human camp
searching for food, but they will run at the first sign of danger.

<monster name="Mongoose">
<details><habitat> Woods, Rough, Marsh
<frequency> Common
<number> 1-20 (6)

<description> Mongooses have light gray fur and grow to a length of
about two feet. They are very common rodents in some parts of the
world, and are valued as snake-killers.

<talents> Mongooses have no special skills or talents. They are not
tool or magic users.

<weapons> Mongooses get one bite in Cloie Combat at a Base Chance of
80&percnt of doing [D - 6] Damage.

<comments> Mongooses are especially valued as house pets and a
mongoose which is trained to remain in the vicinity of a dwelling (and
protect against snakes, especially cobras) will fetch 300-400 Silver
Pennies. They are relatively easy to train for this task.

<monster name="Rat">
<details><habitat> Caverns, Ruins, Crypts
<frequency> Common
<number> 1-100 (12)

<description> Usually about eight inches long, these animals can be
any combination of shades of black, white, or brown. Some larger
strains of rats can grow to 18 inches (with corresponding increase in
the damage they can do and their Base Chance of biting during Close
Combat - see below).

<talents> Rats have no special talents, skills, or magical abilities.

<weapons> Rats have a Base Chance of 75&percnt of doing [D - 7] damage in
Close Combat. They cannot attack in Melee Combat.

<comments> Rats are not tool-users, but they can dig holes and gnaw
through substances as hard as sandstone and lead, given enough
time. When in combat they tend to head for the eyes and other
unprotected areas, so the armor protection Rating of characters
defending against rats should be reduced by three or four points. A
character has a 10&percnt chance of contracting a disease if he is in
contact with rats for any period of time. If a character is bitten by
a rat, increase chance of infection by 20.

<monster name="Weasel">
<details><habitat> Woods
<frequency> Uncommon
<number> 1-2 (1)

<description> Weasels have a brown coat during the summer, which turns
white as winter approaches. They are slim, and utterly vicious.  The
pelts of weasels taken during winter are worth 40-70 Silver Pennies
each.


<talents> Weasels are the only animals which can stand the gaze and
breath of the basilisk, and thus they are often trained to kill
them. They are, however, difficult to train and a trained Basilisk
killer is worth 4,000-6,000 Silver Pennies. Other than this special
ability, weasels have no talents or skills. They use neither tools nor
magic.

<weapons> Weasels may only attack in Close Combat by biting.  Bite has
a Base Chance of 75&percnt of doing [D + 4] damage.

<comments> Weasels are very curious, and they are thus fairly easy to
trap. If a pair of weasels is found in spring, there is a
80&percnt chance they will be accompanied by 4-8 young. Weasels are
bloodthirsty, and will gladly take on much larger creatures.

<monster name="Wolf">

<habitat> Woods
<frequency> Uncommon
<number> 2-24 (6)

<description> The color of wolves' fur varies greatly with
environment, but they will usually be colored so as to blend in with
their surroundings. The thickness of the fur depends on the season.

<talents> Wolves have no skills, talents or magical abilities and are
not tool users. Wolves have incredible stamina, however, and can run
for literally days at a time.

<weapons> Wolves Melee Attack with their bite. (Base Chance of
60&percnt, [D + 1] Damage). In Close Combat, damage from biting goes
up to [D + 3].

occupied by from 3-12 cubs per female in the pack.
