    <h1>Giants, Faries and Earth Dwellers</h1>
    <h2>Giant Humanoids</h2>
    <p>This Section includes all larger than average size humanoid
species. Included are 6 flavors of Giants (Cloud, Fire, Frost, Hill,
Stone and Storm).  Other giant humanoids include Ogres, Trolls and
Titans.

      <h3>Cloud Giant</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Rough Very Rare1-4 (1)
 Cloud giants are huge humanoids between 15 and 20 feet
tall. Cloud Giants will often build sky-castles on mountain
tops. These will seem to float on pillars of cloud and can only be
reached by a stone stairwell inside the pillars on which it
floats. The pillars and the clouds on which the castle rests will be
substantial (capable of bearing weight), though they will appear to be
clouds.  Cloud Giants are 3-hex figures.
See Character generation.
 Cloud Giants favor the club and the sword, and will have
Rank 2-4 with these weapons. They will sometimes wear armor, although
it is rare to see a Giant clothed in anything heavier than leather.

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong>Rough Rare 1-10 (5)
 Hill Giants are humanoids about nine feet tall.  Their
features will usually be uncommonly gnarled.   But note that
a hill giant is not affiliated with any element in particular, and
thus has expanded options as to his choice of College. His mastery of
a College will usually be minimal (about Rank 3) if he does belong to
a College (25[percnt] chance). Hill giants will use all weapons, although they generally
prefer simple crushing weapons like the club or mace.  They will have
rank 1-5 with these weapons. Hill giants rarely wear armor, although
they will occasionally (2[percnt]) wear chainmail or leather.

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Rough (especially mountaintops)Very Rare1-3 (1)
Storm giants are huge humanoids about 20 feet tall. Storm
Giants are 3-hex figures.
 Storm giants have all the talents, skills, magic, and other
abilities noted in 6.6.  In addition, they can control the weather,
bringing rain, wind, thunderstorms, and even a fair sky.  Depending on
the difference between the weather they are trying io create and the
weather state at the time that they are doing so, it will be from one
to three hours until the effects of their control become evident.
Note that storm giants are not particularly affiliated with any of the
Elementals.  There is a 50[percnt] chance that a storm giant will be a
member of a College.  If he is a member of a College, a storm giant
will have rank 3-7 with General Knowledge spells, and Rank 2-5 with
those Special Knowledge spells that he knows (GM's option).
 Storm giants prefer edged weapons, with axes being the
weapons they most commonly use.  They will have Rank four or better
with the type of weapon that they use most frequently.  Storm giants
can be found in any sort of armor, although chainmail is the norm.
 Running: 700-750
</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> True to their name, Storm Giants enjoy turbulent weather,
and there will frequently be a thunderstorm about their mountainous
home.  Those traits mentioned in 6.6 are also applicable to storm
giants.

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Rough, Woods Rare 1-20 (4) Ogres are large, ugly humanoids.  They are 8 feet tall,
have flattened noses and large, sharp teeth.  They will usually be
wearing rags.
 Ogres generally shun magic, although there is a 5[percnt] chance
that an ogre will belong to the College of Earth Magics if he has an
MA of 15.  The highest rank that an ogre will ever attain with any
spell is 5, and this only rarely.
 Ogres prefer to use large clubs over other weapons.  Ranged
weapons are rare, but possible.  Ogres will also use shields and wear
armor 80[percnt] of the time. If they do wear armor, it will usually be
chainmail or lighter. In Close Combat or in the absence of a weapon
ogres can also bite (Base Chance of 65[percnt], + 4 Damage).

 Running: 450</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Ogres eat those travellers that they waylay and take their
treasure.  They are intelligent enough so that they will not attack a
party if they are hopelessly outclassed, but they are stupid enough so
that they can also be easily outwitted.  Ogres will usually have
treasure in the form of gold and gems.</dt>

      <h3>Titan</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> See below Very Rare  1-2 (1) Titans are basically human, but they are between 20 feet
and 24 feet tall.  They are also unusually muscular, and appear
strikingly handsome or beautiful.  They can be of either sex. Titans
are 3-hex figures.
 Titans are highly magical.  They can turn invisible,
disappear from this plane, and move through the air by willing it.
They can also use spells, talents, and rituals of any one College.
They are protected from physical attack by a magical aura which
surrounds them.  This aura also adds 40 to their Magic Resistance.
They will know General and Special Knowledge of their College at Rank
10 and above. Titans use human-type weapons of 4-times normal size
(improve Base Chance by 20[percnt], multiply damage by 4 after
modification). They will sometimes wear armor (which functions in
addition to their aura) if they are doing something which is
pre-meditated, and they know will be very dangerous.
 Running: 600; Flying: 300
</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Titans are basically good in nature, and they will help
people on occasion.  They are often very touchy, however, and if they
think a human is being insolent they will not hesitate to kill him,
although sometimes (30[percnt]) they will just vanish.  If a titan is
inhabiting this plane for some reason, it will have a large castle,
very substantial treasure, and numerous storm giant guards.

      <h3>Troll</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Rough, Caverns, Ruins, Fields, MarshesUncommon-3 (1)
 Trolls are large green, vaguely humanoid beings with
greenish black heads and extremeties.  They are well muscled and
long-limbed with thick, leathery skin.  Their large teeth and claws
are ideally suited to rending the "manflesh" they so highly prize.  A
full-grown troll may stand almost 15 feet high.  Trolls are 3-hex
monsters.
 Trolls possess no skills to speak of and are not
magic-users.  They may use simple weapons, but may never achieve any
Rank with a weapon.  Trolls possess the ability to regenerate
themselves at the rate of 1 Damage Point healed each Pulse.  Any
damage inflicted by fire is, however, permanent and may not be healed
by regeneration.  Trolls are not afraid of fire. A Troll may use its hands (Base Chance of 55[percnt], Damage of +
6, no Rank) to Melee Attack or may use hands and teeth (Base Chance of
35[percnt], Damage of +4, no Rank) in Close Combat.  It may Strike twice with
hands and once with teeth each Pulse.
 Running: 300
</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Trolls become enraged by the presence of fire and will kill
anyone who uses it if possible. Trolls can reproduce themselves but
loosing a limb, which regenerates into a new troll, but only once per
decade or so.  The only way to prevent this or to keep a Troll from
regenerating after death is to burn the Troll's corpse (or any stray
pieces).  A Troll is unlikely to possess or guard treasure, but may
have a few "pretties" in his possession (gold or jewelry and such).
The net worth of such items will usually be no more than 500 silver
pennies, but could equal 1,000 in rare instances.

    <h2>Fairy Folk</h2>
    <p>Fairy folk include brownies, dryads, elves, fossergrims, leprechauns,
nixons, nymphs, pixies, satyrs, and sylphs.  They are all roughly
related, though their natures have diverged since the time when they
could claim a common ancester, Brownies, Leprechauns, Nixons, Pixies
and Sylphs all take [D - 2] damage from physical contact with cold
iron in addition to any other damage that may be inflicted by a weapon
made of that substance.  This damage is due to burning. Other fairy
folk do not suffer this effect, but prefer to use substances other
than cold iron for tools and artifacts. Only the Elves have overcome
their fear of the substance to the extent of habitually forging and
using fine iron and steel weapons.

      <h3>Brownie (house spirit)</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Fields (usually around man or his dwellings) Uncommon 1-30 (6)
 Brownies are "little people" similar to Leprechauns, but
more sociable. They tend to be benevolent toward those who are not of
Facrie (unlike their wilder kindred who despise humans).
 Brownies specialize in using minor magics to assist in
keeping order, repairing minor damage, and doing light work around
human dwellings. They can bless or curse crops in the same manner as a
wiccan. Their small help can also be turned to mischief if they are
affronted in any way. This might take the form of falling roof tiles,
collapsing floorboards, or other small disasters. Brownies have no natural weapons. They carry small swords
(treat as daggers), but do not use armor. They may also carry bows
which will have the same characteristics as the Small Bow (see Weapons
Table).

 Running: 150
</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Brownies will aid the human inhabitants of an area in
exchange for food (a dish of milk left out each night). If
disaffected, they will seek out and give information to the
hosuehold's enemies.

 Dryads are insubstantial spirits living within the wood
of a specific tree. They can leave their tree and wander about, but
may never stray more than a mile from the tree.  They usually appear
in small colonies.
 Dryads tend to be Adepts of the College of Earth Magics,
though some may be members of the Colleges of Illusion or the
Sorceries of the Mind. They will not usually be very powerful in
Colleges other than Earth, however.  They have the special ability of
being able to take refuge deep within their tree if threatened.
 Dryads use no weapons of any kind.
  Running: 200
</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Dryads can only be harmed if their tree is killed by
chopping or burning it down. They are not usually inimical to man,
though "Black Dryads" do exist who practice Druidic rites (including
blood sacrifice). They will usually aid travellers, but are mainly
concerned with the well being of their trees.

 Fossergrims look much like Gnomes and are about the same
size. However, they are water dwellers and have a water-breathing
capacity in addition to their air-breathing capacity. They will always
be found in or near their lairs which will be located at the foot of
waterfalls or rapids wherever possible.
 Fossergrims have the ability to cast very weak and limited
illusions over water so as to make shoals and rapids appear to be safe
channels. They also havc the ability to cast a charm over an
individual, causing him to swim into their lair (which will be in an
underwater cave) and be drowned. This works like a talent. Victims
must roll 2 x Willpower or less or succumb to the charm.
 Fossergrims attack with their teeth in Close Combat and have
a Base Chance of 40[percnt] of doing [D - 2] Damage. They may also use
small simple non-missile weapons (knives, shon swords, and the like).
  Running: 150; Swimming: 100

kindred. Except for their special magical abilities which they use to
lure the unwary into their halls, they possess little magic and few
skills or talents. What other magic they possess will be Water Magic.

      <h3>Leprechaun</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Plains, Woods, Fields Very Rare 1-30 (8)
 Leprechauns are similar in almost all ways to Brownies,
but wilder and shyer of man. They tend to dress in muted shades of
brown and green and to seek out the deep woods where they are most at
home. They have 3 to 4 times the stealth of an average human and will,
as a result, seldom be seen unless they wish to speak with a party.
 Leprechauns possess the same Talent Magic as Brownies. In
addition, they will usually be masters of either the College of
Illusions or the College of Earth Magics. They have the ability to
teleport themselves limited distances (no more than a few yards) by
blinking. Leprechauns also have special skill with the Spell of
Sleeping (regardless of their College) and add 10 to the Base Chance
for the spell. Leprechauns have no natural weapons. They will usually have
Short Swords (similar to Daggers) and will use Small Bows.

        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> If a Leprechaun is captured and cannot escape, he will buy
his freedom either by revealing the location of his treasure (300-400
Gold Pieces) or by granting the warder three wishes which the
leprechaun will attempt to grant in such away that they turn to the
disadvantage of the recepient (usually in some really grisly way).

 Nixies are water-dwellers with pale skin (through which
can often be seen green veins), golden hair, webbed fingers and toes,
and gills. They have a limited air breathing capacity similar to
Merfolk. They are recognizable by their sharp teeth which are covered
in green slime.

 Nixies will almost always have limited abilities as Adepts
of the College of Water Magics. They will have no skills to speak of,
but will have the talent of being able to automatically summon [D + 1]
x Rank with their talent (1, if unranked) large Pike to their
aid. Since these "water wolves", as they are called, have a special
fondness for Nixies, there will always be Pike in the area. Nixies do [D - 2] Damage (Base Chance of 35[percnt]) in Close
Combat with their bite. in addition, they will often carry fishbone
weapons and shields and (rarely) wear fishskin armour (equal to
leather armour).
 Swimming: 350
</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Nixies are fond of human flesh, though they will sometimes
refrain from eating a particularly beautiful humanoid member of the
opposite sex in order to enjoy their company longer. They are
capricious and cowardly and prefer to destroy their prey by guile
whenever possible. An invitation to a Nixie feast is usually a prelude
to treachery.

        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Woods, Fields (usually found with Satyrs) Rare 1-30 (6)
 Nymphs are beautiful humanoids with goat-like lower
limbs covered in soft curly hair. They generally prefer to go about
naked, but will wear light robes in cold weather.
 Nymphs will have some abilities of either the College of
Illusions or of the College of Earth Magics.  They will have twice the
stealth of humans. In addition, any male character who looks at a
naked Nymph must roll 4 x WP or less or he will be charmed and will
desire only to spend his days frolicking with the Nymph (or her
sisters). Nymphs do not use weapons or fight in any way.  They rely
exclusively on their beauty and magic for protection.
  Running: 250
</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Nymphs dislike the intrusion of humans, but will attempt to
charm and seduce a particularly handsome man with their beauty (40[percnt]chance) if they do not first flee (50[percnt] chance) If they flee, they will
attempt to punish those who frightened them. Nymphs can move from
place to place by entering the trunks of trees and then teleporting
from one trunk to another.  It takes them 30 seconds to enter the
trunk of a tree and one second to teleport to any other trunk within
100 feet of the tree they currently occupy.

Nymphs have little sense of normal human anatomy or capabilities and
will kill a human lover with their demands by permanently reducing his
Fatigue or Endurance at the rate of 1 point from either (GM's choice)
per week until the lover dies or escapes. The lover may make a check
against 2 times his Willpower at the end of each week to see if he
runs away from his sweet captors (leaving behind most of his weapons,
armour, and other possessions in his state of befuddlement).

 Pixies are small people about 2 feet in height, A,ith
transparent wings, pointed ears, and almond-shaped eyes.
 Pixies are naturally invisible, but can become visible at
will. They can create full-fledged visible and audible illusions, and
can appear to change their form.  They are also able to use most
counter spells, read peoples' minds, and cause disorientation and the
inability to think clearly in the victims of their pranks.
 Pixies use daggers and bows of short range (50 feet) but
with great effect. They have three types of arrow: one which does [D -
6] damage, one that puts their victims to sleep unless they roll 4 x
Willpower or less, and one that removes all memory from the victim for
[D - 4] days unless they roll 4 x Willpower or less. The bow has a

skin is a deep mahogany in color.
 Satyrs are somewhat magical.  Their magical abilities are
usually focused through a pipe which they play to charm, delight, or
otherwise influence those around them. They are also 3 times as
stealthy as humans, and can blend in with surrounding trees (90[percnt]chance they will be undetected if they remain still. Satyrs have

 Gnolls are good diggers if forced to do so, but they will
rarely attempt mining on their own, even though they like caves. They
have no magical abilities, although they will sometimes have magical
items which they will rarely know how to use. Gnolls tend toward the larger weapons, usually axes. They
will use ranged weapons, however, and any large contingent will have a
fair number of archers. They usually wear light armor (leather or
cloth) but strong members of a group will sometimes have better armour.

 Gnomes are short, stocky humanoids, much fike Dwarves,
but even shorter (3 feet). Tvpically they will be dressed in chainmail
or leather armor, with a heavy skullcap, although powerful gnomes
occasionally wear heavier armour as they "make light of burden."
Gnomes are usually brownish in color with hair between grey and white.

 Gnomes are excellent stoneworkers, and as such they can
detect many things that have to do with the construction of a building
or the quality of a builder's job. Gnomes will use daggers, short swords, clubs, and any other
weapons that they can carry easily.

Elves. Large bands of Gnomes will often (80[percnt]) have a fair amount
(value: [D + 3] x 100 Silver Pennies per gnome) of treasure. Gnomes
found in their lair will have more treasure (value [D + 3] x 300

 Goblins are humanoid in form, but have large fangs,
pointed ears, and skin ranging from brown to pallid grey.  They are
usually very ugly, have foul breath, and an unpleasant odor. They wear
garments made out of dirty cloth, and usually wear leather armor,
carrying shields. More powerful goblins will sometimes carry better
armor. They are about 4 feet tall.
 Goblins are good at working with stone if forced into it,
and so they are good at detecting facts having to do with stone
(40[percnt] chance of detecting anything unusual or dangerous). They
can see in the dark. They are excellent at torture, which they delight
in. A goblin will in rare instances be an Adept of one of the
Entities. Goblins will use any sort of weapon that their strength
allows, although they generally prefer simple swords or clubs. They
will also often use crossbows and slings. They may have Rank 1-3 with
these weapons.

guarded. Goblins dislike sunlight, and fight at a reduction in the
Base Chance of 10 when under a bright sun.  They hate Dwarves and
Gnomes, and will attack them whenever possible. Goblins will usually
be in league with dire wolves if there are any in the neighborhood.

hairy than goblins', although it is the same broxwn to greyish
color.
 Hobgoblins have Goblins' stoneworking ability and their
ability to see in the dark, but they do not dislike sunlight, and
often go out in the day on raiding parties. They have the same magical
abilities as Goblins. Hobgoblins use all weapons, and will usually use the largest
weapon their strength allows. They like whips and spears with long,
barbed points that break off in the wound.  Hobgoblins rarely use

      <h3>Kobold</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Fields, Caverns. Rare Rare 1-10 (5)
 Kobolds are small, elderly-appearing dwarvish types who
wear hoods of bright colors. They are about 2 1/2 feet tall, and have
highly gnarled faces.
 Kobolds are very useful around the house or farm, for they
will perform many tasks relating to maintenance of property or
animals. They have no special magical powers, and they are not as good
at working with stone and at detecting unusual constructions as the
dwarves. They can see in the dark.
 Kobolds carry Daggers and Hammers (Base Chance of 30[percnt], [D -
2] damage). They do not wear armour.
  Running: 100
</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> A Kobold in the house is a blessing, for they will perform
all sorts of menial or semi-skilled tasks with great willingness and
ability, where such is possible. They will work for only shelter and
food. While travelling, they will most likely run away if they see a
party at a distance, but there is a 25[percnt] chance that they will be
willing to trade information and befriend a character. In general,
Kobolds get along with men better even than the Dwarves. Kobolds will
almost never have treasure, although if they do it will usually be
something of value only to them.

      <h3>Orc</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Caverns, Rough Common  Common  1-1000 (25)
 An Orc is an ugly, stoop shouldered humanoid, much like
a goblin or hobgoblin (to whom they are related).
 See character generation. The scimitar is the favorite weapon of the orcs (Rank 1-4
with the weapon is typical) although other weapons will occasionally
be used. Short bows are the most common form of missile weapon. Orcs
will wear armor, with leather being the prevalent type. Orcs mill
also commonly carry shields.
