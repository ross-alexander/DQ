addition to two classes of prehumans: neanderthals and sasquatchs. All
of these tend to be shy of humans and will usually dwell in high
mountains or deep jungle.  They have three times the stealth of an
average human (30) and are often adept at tracking and have other
talents sometimes associated with the Ranger Skill.

feet tall, and 120 pounds in weight. They are characterized by their
large heads and long sharp fangs.  Baboons generally have light brown
fur, but may have brightly coloured (orange, blue, purple or red)
faces and/or rumps (especially females).
</description><talents> Baboons possess no special talents or skills. They are
neither magic nor tool users and are only semi-intelligent.
</talents><weapons> Baboons cannot attack except in Close Combat.  They will
swarm over their victim, using their bite (Base Chance of 65&percnt;,
Damage of +4) to kill by increasing blood loss.  Comments: Baboons
tend to be vicious and unpredictable, attacking without warning. They
are tribal in nature and do not fear men when in company with the rest
of the tribe.  They can sometimes (30&percnt; chance) be assuaged by
food (usually meat).

prominant canines and are vicious fighters.  Due to their great

apes.

tool or magic users.
</talents><weapons> Gorillas may only attack via Close Combat.  However, they
may enter Close Combat with an entity whose combined modified Agility

and pulling him into their hex.  This maneuver requires a Charge
Action and is implemented in the same manner (except that the victim
is pulled out of his hex into the gorilla's.  Gorillas may bite (Base

</number><description> Dingoes are wild dogs, usually between 2 and 3 feet in
length and sometimes marked in the same manner as jackals. The
characteristics of dingoes are the same for all types of dogs, though,
unlike dingoes, other types may be trained and sold without
restriction (since they do not have the savage nature of wild dogs).

attacking humanoids unless they catch an individual alone and are

be sold to an individual who was not present at their training.

feet in length. Their hides are specked with large dark brown
rings. They have short tails and rounded ears. The forelegs of a hyena
are longer than the rear legs, so when the animal stands, it seems to
slope downward from its shoulders to its tail.  At night, hyenas can
be recognized by their barking howl.

through substances as hard as sandstone and lead, given enough
time. When in combat they tend to head for the eyes and other
unprotected areas, so the armor protection Rating of characters
defending against rats should be reduced by three or four points. A
character has a 10&percnt; chance of contracting a disease if he is in
contact with rats for any period of time. If a character is bitten by
a rat, increase chance of infection by 20.

</number><description> Weasels have a brown coat during the summer, which turns
white as winter approaches. They are slim, and utterly vicious.  The
pelts of weasels taken during winter are worth 40-70 Silver Pennies
each.

</description><talents> Weasels are the only animals which can stand the gaze and
breath of the basilisk, and thus they are often trained to kill
them. They are, however, difficult to train and a trained Basilisk
killer is worth 4,000-6,000 Silver Pennies. Other than this special
ability, weasels have no talents or skills. They use neither tools nor
magic.
