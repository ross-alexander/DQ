<description> These birds have dark brown plummage and thin,
unfeathered necks of a tannish color. Their beaks are black and
snub-tipped. They prey on the dead and near-dead (espcially if
unconscious).

<talents> Buzzards can see each other miles away, and thus when one
buzzard descends for a meal, others soon follow. Except for their keen
eyesight, buzzards possess no special talents, skills or magic. They
are not tool users.

<weapons> A buzzard attacks in Close Combat with its claws and
beak. The claws' Base Chance is 45&percnt, for [D − 5] Damage, while the
bite's Base Chance is 40&percnt, for [D − 6] Damage. A buzzard cannot attack
in Melee Combat.
