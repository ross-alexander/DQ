giant land turtles, gila monsters, hydras, land iguanas, salamanders,
suarime, and wyverns.  Except for wyverns and suarime, these species
will be unintelligent.
</notes><monster name="Basilisk (Cockatrice)"><details><habitat> All habitats except Plains and Oceans</habitat><frequency> Uncommon</frequency><number> 1-2 (1)
</number><description> The Basilisk is a fat reptilian creature about 5 feet
long and 2 feet in height. These are slow, heavily-armoured lizards
with limited intelligence.  They have strong jaws with two-inch
fangs.  They are man-eaters, but infinitely prefer fish when they can
get it.  Basilisks are usually brownish in colour with lighter
underbellies.
</description><talents> A basilisk has no skills or magical abilities to speak of,
but does possess the special talent of turning a target to stone with
a glance.  Anyone who is within 50 feet of the basilisk may be
attacked in this manner.  The basilisk expends a Fire Action and the
figure against whom the action is directed undergoes an attack as if
from a Thrown Weapon (BC of 60&percnt;). A basilisk breathes a cone of
poison gas 5 feet by 3 feet wide as its base.
</talents><weapons> The basilisk does not use weapons, but may bite (Base Chance
of 40&percnt;, Damage + 3) during Close Combat and may use its gaze in
Ranged, Melee and Close Combat and breath in Melee or Close Combat.
Any hit scored with its breath does D + 10 Damage due to poisoning
(not absorbed by armour or shields). If a basilisk's gaze is reflected
back at itself, it is killed.

</number><description>Crocodiles are heavily scaled lizards with small sharp teeth.  They
attain lengths of 8 feet, and weights of up to 180 pounds.  Their
scales are a very dark greenish-brown that blends in well with the
muddy water that they love to inhabit.
</description><talents>Crocodiles have no special talents, skills or magic.
</talents><weapons> Crocodiles cannot attack except in Close Combat and they
attack with two claws (Base Chance of 50&percnt;, [D - 6] Damage) and
their bite (Base Chance of 10&percnt;, [D + 1] Damage).

</na></stats><comments> Crocodiles often lurk just below the surface of murky
waters, waiting for a tidbit to enter the water.  On land, however,
crocodiles are rather timid, and they will slip off into the water if
they sense something approaching.  If a crocodile's jaws are grasped
while they are still closed, it only takes a PS of 12 to hold them
closed, rendering the Crocodile's bite useless.  The crocodile's skin
is used to make primitive armour (equal to leather) and the teeth
(about 60) are valuable (100 Silver Pennies each) as charms.</comments></monster><monster name="Giant Land Turtle"><details><habitat> Marsh (or beach)</habitat><frequency> Rare</frequency><number> 1-30 (6)
</number><description>Giant Land Turtles have the form of an ordinary turtle, with a thick
green shell and claws instead of webbed digits. They are about 5 feet
long, and weigh about 700 pounds.
</description><talents> Giant Land Turtles can withdraw their head, tail, and limbs
inside their shell in times of danger.  They have no magical or other
special abilities.  If the Turtle is not withdrawn into its shell,
there is a 80&percnt; chance that any blow will strike the shell anyway. If
the turtle is inside its shell, all strikes will be softened by the
shell.</talents><weapons> The Land Turtle can only attack by biting in Close
Combat. Its Base Chance is 25&percnt; and its Damage is [D - 2].

in the water, where they will frequently be found.  A land turtle is
capable of carrying a large burden (up to 400 lbs.)  if one is willing
to keep a pace that the turtle can follow.

</number><description> Gila Monsters are black and yellow lizards with short, thin
limbs and a striped stubby tail.
</description><talents> The gila monster has no special talents, skills, or magic.
</talents><weapons> Gila monsters can bite in Close Combat, but they cannot
attack in Ranged or Melee Combat.  The Base Chance for their bite is
50&percnt;, and it does [D - 3] Damage.  If the bite penetrates any
armour that might be worn to do actual damage to Fatigue or Endurance,
the target takes 2 DP per pulse (not absorbed by armour) for the next
D10 pulses, or until an antidote to the Gila monster's poison is
administered.

</number><description> A Hydra is a nine-headed snake.  They are 12 to 15 feet
long, and have thick green scales.  Hydras also have a foul smell and
venomous breath.  Hydras are four-hex creatures.
</description><talents> If a hydra is hit in combat for four or more points of
damage (after subtracting for the defensive benefits of the hydra's
scales) there is a 70&percnt; chance that one of the hydra's heads has been
destroyed.  Two pulses after a head is destroyed, two more grow back,
and on the beginning of the next pulse after that they can attack in
combat. One of the hydra's original nine heads will be immortal.  This
head cannot be killed, and does not regenerate as do the others.
Instead, if a hydra has no Endurance remaining, the head is assumed
to have been cut off.  If the head is cut off, it can no longer move
or attack except in Close Combat.  The only way to kill one of the
hydra's mortal heads is to burn it while it is regenerating (a
successful strike with a torch will do this). Each time a head
regenerates, the Hydra gains three points of Endurance.  (Note that
this will occasionally mean that a hydra will have more Endurance
points at the end of a battle than before). In any event, if a hydra's
Endurance is ever reduced to zero or below, all of the heads die
except the immortal one mentioned above.</talents><weapons> A hydra can attack once with each of its heads.  Up to six
heads can attack without penalty in either Close or Melee Combat.  The
Base Chance for one of a hydra's heads is 55&percnt;, and each bite
does [D + 2] Damage.  In addition, if a bite penetrates target's
armour to do damage to Fatigue or Endurance, the target takes 5 DP per
pulse for the next D10 pulses due to the hydra's poison, which is
deadly.  Only antidotes specifically designed for hydra poison will be
effective against their venom.

</number><description> Iguanas are large lizards, sometimes reaching more than 3 feet
in length.  They are sandy to brown in colour, and have ridges along
their back.  They have a short, thick tail, and wrinkled skin around
their neck.  Giant iguanas may up to 3 times normal size and have
double or triple PS, EN, and FT.
</description><talents> Iguanas have no magical abilities or special talents.

</number><description> A salamander is a three foot long lizard, reddish brown in
colour, with fiery red eyes.
</description><talents> Salamanders have the ability to set things on fire by
concentrating their gaze. The action is deliberate, in that something
will not be burnt unless the salamander wishes to burn it.  Only
flammable items can be ignited. If a salamander concentrates its gaze
on a living creature, the creature takes [D + 12] Damage.  The gaze
can be resisted, and only one creature can be stared at at any one
time.  Treat the gaze as a Fire action on the Tactical Display.
</talents><weapons> A salamander can use its gaze in Close, Ranged, and Melee
Combat (range: 200 feet).  In addition, a salamander can make a bite
attack in Close Combat with a Base Chance of 40&percnt;, doing [D + 2]
Damage.

</number><description> Suarime are basically humanoid, but they are reptilian in
outward appearance.  They have heavy scales along the entire body, and
have a long, heavy tail that they can use as a weapon to knock down
their victims.  They also have claws and a long forked tongue. They
are about 7 feet tall, and are greenish-yellow in colour.
</description><talents> Suarime can fight normally under water, but they must come
up for air eventually, although they can hold their breath for periods
of more than 5 minutes.  They have their own language, but will rarely
(5&percnt;) speak anything comprehensible to men. They do not normally
use magic, although intelligence varies widely.
</talents><weapons> Lizard men generally use simple weapons like spears or
clubs. The larger the weapon, the more the suarime prefer it as they
greatly enjoy using their strength to the utmost.  Suarime will use
shields if they find them or capture them.  Their claws have a Base
Chance of 35&percnt; of doing [D + 1] Damage.

</comments></monster><monster name="Wyvern (Mere Dragon)"><details><habitat> Rough (hills mostly), Woods, Marsh</habitat><frequency> Uncommon</frequency><number> 1-5 (2)
</number><description> Wyverns are distant cousins of dragons, but are smaller and not
blessed with the intelligence of dragons.  Usually, 6 to 10 feet tall,
the wyvern is portrayed as a one-hex character with its tail extending
into its rear hex a short distance (just enough so that it can knock a
character standing in that hex off their feet). Wyverns are slate gray
in colour and have tough armoured hides.
</description><talents>Wyverns, unlike their larger cousins, are non-magical. Their
shriveled front limbs are not suitable for grasping much except
already subdued prey.  The wyvern's tail contains a scorpion-like
sting which may be used to infect a target in the hex the wyvern is
facing with poison (the sting is used in an over-the-head-attack). It
may not be used to attack characters behind it.
</talents><weapons> In addition to its tail which may be used in Melee (Base
Chance of 45&percnt;, quick-acting poison instead of Damage, no Rank)
the wyvern may bite in Melee and Close Combat (Base Chance of
40&percnt; Damage of [D + 4], no Rank).  A wyvern may not sting and
bite in the same pulse.  A wyvern can attempt to knock down a
character in his rear hex using his tail.  This type of attack is
executed like a Shield Attack.

poisonous snakes. It is usually dark brown in colour, With a
collapsible hood behind its head with a sort of horseshoe marking on
its back. The king cobra is the mortal enemy of the mongoose.
</description><talents> Cobras possess no talents, skills or magic.
</talents><weapons> Despite its size, the king cobra cannot attack unless it is
in Close Combat. In Close Combat it attacks via its bite (Base Chance

</description><talents> Mambas possess no talents, skills or magic.
</talents><weapons> The mamba cannot attack in Melee Combat. In Close Combat it
can bite (Base Chance 50&percnt;, - 2 Damage).  Damage is only used to
determine if the snake did in fact penetrate armour with its fangs for
the purpose of injecting its poison. Mamba poison is among the most

</talents><weapons> Pythons may only attack in Close Combat. Pythons attack by
biting (Base Chance of 65&percnt;, + 6 Damage). If the bite penetrates
armour, it hangs on, and at the next opportunity wraps it self around
its adversary, crushing the life out of it.  Wrap: Base Chance of 80&percnt;,

dark brown in colour.
</description><talents> The spitting naja possesses no talents, skills or magic.
</talents><weapons> In Melee Combat, spitting najas can only spit (Base Chance
of 40&percnt;), If they hit, (aiming at the eye) the person hit is blinded
until the eye is thoroughly washed. Unless the eye is washed
promptly, the blindness becomes permanent. In Close Combat, the naja
gets a bite (Base Chance of 65&percnt;, - 2 Damage for purposes of armour
penetration). The bite's damage is not actually sustained, but is
rather used to determine if the snake has penetrated armour so as to
allow its venom to work. The venom does 1 DP per Pulse (in addition to
blinding the victim) until an antidote is administered.
