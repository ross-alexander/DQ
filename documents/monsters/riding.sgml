<group name="Riding animals">

<notes>
This Section is concerned with common riding and pack animals and
includes descriptions of donkeys, drafthorses, mules, palfries,
ponies, mustangs, quarterhorses, and warhorses.  Avian mounts, camels,
oxen and other types of riding and pack animals are described
elsewhere.

All of the riding animals described in this Section except the
warhorse have similar combat abilities.  They can attack with a kick
any entity occupying the hex directly opposite the hex they are
facing.  Their bite can be used in either Melee or Close Combat, but
their kick can only be used in Melee Combat.  Only one of these two
types of attacks can be made in a single Pulse.  The Base Chance and
Damage for each of these attacks is given individually for each
animal.

Mounts are generally not adept at fighting and will only attack if
directly threatened or if panicked.  Only trained warhorses will
intentionally enter the same hex on the Tactical Display as another
figure other than their rider(s).

very large ears and reach about four feet at the shoulders.

<talents> No special talents, magic, or other abilities. They are not

food, and will serve well unless mistreated. They can carry burdens of
up to 250 pounds with great endurance.

<description> Draft horses are the largest of the horses, growing to
more than five and a half feet and weights of up to 2300 pounds. They
have huge muscles and thick limbs, and they will frequently have hairy
feet of a different color than the rest of their body.

<talents> Draft horses possess no special talents, skills, or
magic. They are not tool users.

<comments> Draft horses are bred to carry burdens without tiring. They
can carry loads of up to 500 pounds, and have great endurance. They
can be ridden, although they are not especially sensitive to a rider's
wishes.

<description> Mules art a usually sterile cross-breed of a mare and a
jackass. A mule has a short mane, long ears, small feet, and a tail
with long hairs at the end. They-are usually brown, and are about four
feet high at the shoulders.

<talents> Mules possess no special talents, magic, or other
abilities. They are not tool users.

<weapons>  Kick: BC 40&percnt, [D + 4] damage. Bite: BC 20%, [D − 2] damage.

<comments> Mules are excellent draft animals. They are very strong,
are sure footed, and have great endurance. Loads of up to 300 pounds
can be carried by a mule, although such burdens are rare. Mules are
highly resistant to disease (reduce the chance of infection by 10&percnt if
struck in combat). Mules generally work with little fuss unless
mistreated, in which rase they become stubborn and vicious.

<description> Mustangs are wild horses. They are smaller than most
domestic animals, usually about four and a half feet at the shoulder.
Colors vary, but most mustangs have very long manes and tails.

<talents> Mustangs possess no special talents, skills, or magic. They
are not tool users.

<weapons> Kick: BC = 45&percnt, [D + 4] damage. Bite: BC = 25%, [D + 0]

<comments> Mustangs are generally afraid of men and will run away if
they sense man's presence. They can be tamed if captured, however, and
used either as riding horses or beasts of burden. They can carry loads
of up to 400 pounds.

<description> Palfries are fine-featured riding horses. They grow to a
little more than five feet at the shoulders, and weigh about 1100
pounds.

<comments> These horses were bred for gentleness and appearance. They
were developed to be riding horses, and are highly responsive to their
riders. They can carry up to 350 pounds, but, like the quarterhorse,
they are not usually used to carry burdens.

<comments> Ponies are especially gentle and easy to train. They live
longer than most horses, and do not need any food other than hay and
grass. Loads of up to 150 pounds can be carried without great strain.

<comments>
Quarterhorses are very useful as riding animals.  They can climb steep
banks and ford water. They are extremely responsive to their rider if
well trained and are able to stop or turn very quickly, suiting them
for such tasks as rounding up herds. They do not have great endurance,
however, and they can only maintain their maximum speed for periods of
a few miles. They can carry loads of up to 350 pounds, but they are
not intended to be beasts of burden, and so their spirit will be
quickly broken if they are used as such. If a quarterhorse's spirit is
broken, its speed will be decreased by 30&percnt;.

<monster name="Warhorse">
<details>

<number> Not applicable

<description> Warhorses are heavily built, thickly muscled and limber
animals, bred to carry large burdens for extended periods. They are
often five and a half feet at the shoulder, and can weigh more than a
ton.

<talents> Warhorses are specially trained for combat. They panic less
frequently than other horses A,hen faced with fire, sudden movements,
or loud noises. A rider can also control a warhorse's actions in
combat, making the horse kick, bite, or attempt to trample an
adversary.  See the Rules on Mounted Combat. Other horses can be used
in combat, but they cannot be used to attack.

<weapons> In addition to the kick (Base Chance of 45&percnt, [D + 7]
damage) and bite (Base Chance of 25&percnt, [D + 2] damage) of normal
horses, when in Close Combat a warhorse can also attempt to trample an
adversary (Base Chance of 25&percnt, [D + 8] damage).  Warhorses will
willingly enter Close Combat if their rider directs them to do so.

<comments> These are the most intelligent and (if properly treated)
the most loyal of the horses. They are responsive to a rider, but can
also be used to carry heavy burdens (up to 500 pounds). Using a
warhorse as a draft horse will generally lower the quality of his
training for combat, however.
