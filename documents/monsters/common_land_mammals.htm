    <h2>Apes and Prehumans</h2>
    <p>Apes and prehumans include baboons, gorillas, and orang-outangs in
addition to two classes of prehumans: neanderthals and sasquatchs. All
of these tend to be shy of humans and will usually dwell in high
mountains or deep jungle.  They have three times the stealth of an
average human (30) and are often adept at tracking and have other
talents sometimes associated with the Ranger Skill.

      <h3>Baboon</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Plains Common 1-100 (2) Baboons are medium-sized apes, usually no more than 4
feet tall, and 120 pounds in weight. They are characterized by their
large heads and long sharp fangs.  Baboons generally have light brown
fur, but may have brightly coloured (orange, blue, purple or red)
faces and/or rumps (especially females).
 Baboons possess no special talents or skills. They are
neither magic nor tool users and are only semi-intelligent.
 Baboons cannot attack except in Close Combat.  They will
swarm over their victim, using their bite (Base Chance of 65%,
Damage of +4) to kill by increasing blood loss.  Comments: Baboons
tend to be vicious and unpredictable, attacking without warning. They
are tribal in nature and do not fear men when in company with the rest
of the tribe.  They can sometimes (30% chance) be assuaged by
food (usually meat).

      <h3>Gorilla (Mountain Gorilla/Great Ape)</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Woods, Forest and Mountains Rare 1-40 (20) Gorillas reach 650 pounds and 6+ feet in height.  They
usually have arm spans when full grown of over 10 feet.  Gorillas tend
to have black fur, but older males will often have gray or silver
fur. Some species are entirely white.  Both males and females have
prominant canines and are vicious fighters.  Due to their great
weight, gorillas cannot move between trees in the manner of other
apes.
 Gorillas have no special talents or skills. They are not
tool or magic users.
 Gorillas may only attack via Close Combat.  However, they
may enter Close Combat with an entity whose combined modified Agility
and Physical Strength is half or less their own by grabbing the victim
and pulling him into their hex.  This maneuver requires a Charge
Action and is implemented in the same manner (except that the victim
is pulled out of his hex into the gorilla's.  Gorillas may bite (Base
Chance of 30%, [D - 2] Damage) or rend (Base Chance of
50%, [D + 6] Damage) in Close Combat, but not in the same pulse.

 Neanderthals are a species of pre-human characterized by
sloping foreheads, hairy bodies, limited intelligence, and a
semi-erect posture.
 Neanderthals may have limited Beast Master skills and will
possess most Ranger skills at Ranks 1-6 (some at higher Rank). They
will have no talents and will not be magic users. Neanderthals will
have only a limited tool using capacity and will generally not use
weapons more complicated than stones and clubs.
 Neanderthals will use rocks and sticks and sometimes simple
clubs and axes.  They will rarely (15%) pick up and use a dropped
weapon of a more complex nature.  They will be at a total loss to
figure out the workings of such complex weapons as bows.  They have
prominent canines and will always attempt to enter Close Combat where
they will bite (Base Chance of 30%, [D - 3] Damage) in addition to
striking.
 Running: 300

        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Neanderthals fear other humanoids and will flee them if

as prey.

Orang-outangs possess no skills or talents and are neither magic nor
tool users.
 orang-outangs attack in Melee Combat in the same manner as
humans (striking with bare hands).  In Close Combat, they receive 1
attack per Pulse at a Base Chance of 40% for [D - 1] Damage and
with a possible Rank of 1-3.

however, possess any magic abilities and will not employ any skill
involving tools or weapons.

 Boars grow to 550 pounds, are covered in long, dark
bristles and have long tusks. They tend to be both stupid and vicious.
 Boars have no special skills or talents and use neither
tools nor magic.
Boars always attempt to charge their victims and either impale them on
their tusks or knock them to the ground and trample them. Tusks do [D
- 1] Damage with a Base Chance of 50% and Rank of 1-2. Feet do
[D - 3] Damage with a Base Chance of 20%. A boar may only
attack in Close Combat. He may not trample and tusk in the same Pulse.
  Running: 350</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Boars tend to be nocturnal and will seldom be encountered
in daylight. They are omniverous and will devour anything they find

 A camel is a tawny, thin-legged creature often used as a
riding beast. Camels will have either one large hump on their back or
two. If the latter is in the case, the camel is called a dromedary.
 Camels'metabolisms allow them to retain large quantities of
fat and water, so they are able to survive for long periods without
eating or drinking. On average, a camel can live for a week to ten
days without water without suffering substantial ill effects. While
valued for this trait, they are difficult to train and so will bring
little money in an untrained state. Trained camels will bring 700-900
Silver Pennies.
 Bite has a Base Chance of 30% of doing [D - 1] Damage in
Melee or Close Combat. Camels may kick instead of biting in Melee with
a Base Chance of 25% of doing [D + 4] damage. Camels may only kick
into their rear hexes.

      <h3>Elephant</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Details:</strong> Plains Common 1-50 (20)
 Elephants are 10 to 14 feet high at the shoulder and
weigh between 4 and 8 tons (with ``Indian'' Elephants being much
smaller on the average than ``African'' Elephants). They tend to be
gray in color, but may appear brown, yellow or red, depending upon
what type of mud they have been wallowing in.  Elephants are
four-hex monsters.
 Elephants have no talents or skills and are not magic or
tool users. They are dextrous with their trunks and can often use them
to lift large burdens, shake trees, crush or throw objects (like
people) without much accuracy.  They have a highly developed sense of
smell and poor eyesight.
 The elephant's main weapons are his tusks, which can be used
in Melee or Close Combat with a Base Chance of 15% of doing [D +
2] Damage. If the elephant is charging while making a tusk attack, the
Base Chance is 60% and Damage is [D + 8]. The elephant can also
attack with his trunk during the same Pulse in A,hich he Melee Attacks
with tusks and has a Base Chance of 80% of doing [D - 2]
Damage. If an elephant runs over an entity in Close Combat, he has a
Base Chance of 50% of doing [D + 6] Damage (resolve one attack
per foot, total of 4).
 Running: 450
</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Elephants will usually shy away from humanoids unless
provoked (70% chance that provocation short of attack will be
ignored). If one elephant is attacked, all nearby elephants will come
to his assistance, especially if the elephant is a cow or
calf. Elephant tusks are valuable ([D + 3] Silver Pennies per pound of
ivory with each tusk weighing 100 pounds). Calves will sell for 1000
Silver Pennies and adult bulls will sell for three times that if
unharmed. Adult females may fetch 1500 Silver Pennies if still in
their breeding years</dt>

carabao, etc.) used for pulling wagons, carts, plows, etc., or for
carrying burdens.  Oxen generally have horns, but will seldom use them
unless directly attacked.
 Oxen have no special talent or skill and are neither tool
not magic users. They will almost always be trained to pull a plow or
wagon.
 Oxen may attack in Melee with their horns for [D + 3] Damage

 Stags can attempt to horn with a Base Chance of 30% of doing

 Weasels have a brown coat during the summer, which turns

pelts of weasels taken during winter are worth 40-70 Silver Pennies
each.

 Weasels are the only animals which can stand the gaze and
breath of the basilisk, and thus they are often trained to kill
them. They are, however, difficult to train and a trained Basilisk
killer is worth 4,000-6,000 Silver Pennies. Other than this special
ability, weasels have no talents or skills. They use neither tools nor

 Weasels may only attack in Close Combat by biting.  Bite has
a Base Chance of 75% of doing [D + 4] damage.
 Running: 250</dt>
        <dt><strong>Comments:</strong> Weasels are very curious, and they are thus fairly easy to
