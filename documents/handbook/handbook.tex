\section{A Player's Guild}

\subsection{History of the Campaign}

In August of 1981 a single game-master (GM) Robert Leyland started a
campaign based on the then new DragonQuest (DQ) game.  Since that time
and with the help of more than a few GMs the campaign has expanded to
now encompass roughly 50--60 players, over 100 active characters,
roughly 15 hard working GMs and approximately as many worlds as 15
GMs can dream up.

\subsection{Aim of this Guide}

With such a large group of active role-players in a multi-GM campaign,
a new player can be somewhat overwhelmed.  This guide is intended to
make the entry of a new player into the campaign both easier and more
enjoyable.  In addition it is hoped that this guide will assist the
reader in understanding the reasons behind the GM's decisions when
they may appear, on the surface anyway, to be a bit obscure.

\subsection{Aims of the Campaign}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
To have fun!

\item
To promote good role playing as opposed to simple gaming --- not
because we believe gaming isn't fun, but because we believe
role-playing is more fun.  We aim to do this not by penalising gaming
but by encouraging good role-playing.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Game-masters}

The GM's job is to mediate and guide the character through
adventures.  It is not an easy job, nor is it always done well.  But
without the GMs it is impossible to have a campaign, so if you think
you can do better, try it --- we desperately need all the GMs we can
get to spread the load, and to provide variety for the Players.

With the difficulties of GMing it helps if players obey certain rules
of courtesy.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Try and tolerate other people's faults.  If they really get on your
nerves try and talk to them, please don't shout. Many GMs have a
headache from staying up late writing adventures, and shouting only
makes it worse.

\item
Try and have consideration for the people you are with.  We know it's
hard to remember but everybody has faults, even you, so please try and
minimise them.  If you do screw up try apologising - it usually makes
everyone feel better (and it stops them shouting).

\item
If you have a disagreement with a GM over a rule, or interpretation,
say so.  GM's are not always right, but please say it only once (and
please don't shout).  If the GM stands by the ruling, stop arguing and
get on with the game.  If it really is important bring it up again at
the end of the session. If you still can't settle it, talk to some of
the other GM's and a solution will be found.

\item
If you can't make it to a game session let the GM know so he doesn't
waste time waiting for you.  It is rude and inconsiderate to keep
people waiting.  If you can't turn up to most of the sessions of a
game, or can't be bothered, don't go on the adventure.  It is
extremely frustrating for a GM to spend time creating an adventure
only to have it ruined by players who don't turn up.

\item
Don't intimidate other players or play their characters for them.  If
you can't find a way to give advice in character, then don't.  If
someone really needs help, offer it but don't force it on them.  It's
their right to make mistakes too.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Adventurers Guild}

The Adventurers Guild of Seagate is primarily a game mechanism devised
with great cunning to allow characters to meet and organise adventures
with some vague kind of logical consistency.

As a result of players and characters requesting protection from
dishonest (gasp!)  adventurers, the Guild has developed a system of
screening new members and dispensing justice that, while at times may
infringe on `modern freedoms', does protect members, or at least
punish members who break the law.  From the player's point of view it
is worthwhile remembering that the Guild has been doing this for 25
years and while the player may occasionally fool the GM, the character
never fools the Guild.  While this sounds heavy-handed please
understand it is for the players' protection since players who find
their characters ripped off without any justice stop playing. And it
seems that invariably it is those players who whine loudest about
Guild security who are the ones who come to the GMs for protection
from dishonest characters.

Partly as a result of Guild security, the Guild can appear
authoritarian, but the council are ex-adventurers and do try to act in
the best interests of the members.

The Guild is a non-profit organisation in both intent and fact. This
is not true of many of the Guild members, both active and retired
adventurers, who provide skills and services to the members for a
profit although some are Guild subsidised.  Guild services are given
with restrictions, not to prevent adventurers using them, but because
the Guild just hasn't got the time, money, or manpower to provide
services freely.  Despite the above comments, new and old members are
encouraged to use Guild facilities. If they can't help they may
suggest outside people who can.

Guild representatives and council members in general only give part of
their time to the Guild and the remainder of their time is devoted to
obtaining a living usually by selling services to the Guild members,
so don't expect free service as a right of membership.  Remember,
Guild reps are Guild members too, and if you can ask them for help,
they can also ask you for help.

For the player, remember any dealings with the Guild must be done
through a GM and possibly many GMs, otherwise we can't keep track of
what's happening.  In particular some Guild reps are the
responsibility of specific GMs and if possible these GMs are the
people to talk to if you want something from that Guild rep.

Both the Guild and the GMs have a librarian, both roles being
fulfilled by the same person.  The librarian is trying to gather all
the information that the Guild that has collected over the past years
concerning players, characters, GMs, places, events, adventure scribe
notes, membership forms etc.  It is a big job, so make their life
easier and any time you fill out something for Guild or GM's records,
don't lie.  Not only is it not possible for your character to lie to
the Guild and get away with it (despite the player's ability to lie to
the GM) but if you do, then after the Balrog is finished with the last
offender, we'll send it to get you.

\subsection{The World}

So now you know all about the Guild, it's time to step out into the
world.  Which world you say, yup --- the rumours you heard were true,
most of the GM's have at least one world and/or plane that they
proudly call their own, so you can expect to play anywhere and any
when.  But amidst all this confusion lies one stable consistent place,
Seagate and the Guild.  Well alright, Seagate has undergone some
pretty drastic reality ripples but the Guild is constant, at least
until we have to move. Seagate (at present) is a sea port to the south
of the Western Kingdom.  Southeast lies the Brastor Holdings, to the
north lies civilised lands, and to the sound lies the Five Sisters and
across the sea to the open frontier.  The continent is called Alusia.

\subsection{Character Generation}

To generate a Character for use in the DQ campaign, you will have to
generate a new character with one of the DQ GMs. Generally it is not
allowed for players to ``move'' characters into DQ from other campaigns
or systems.

Generating a character with a GM can be fun and enjoyable. Before you
contact the GM you should think about what type of character you would
like to play. After you have the basic idea, approach one of the GMs
and gain their assistance to generate the character.

You can have more than one character in DQ, but we recommend that you
start a second character no sooner than six months after starting
play. In this time you may gain a better understanding for the system,
and what type of character you would like to play next.

In order to play, one must have a character.  The most important
aspect of the process of character generation is the development of a
defined persona for your character, as opposed to a set of numbers.
To try and help players do this, new characters are rolled up with a
GM and then interviewed ``in character'' by one of three GMs playing
members of the guild membership tribunal.  Players are encouraged to
develop a history and a set of basic motivations for their character.
Just in case you think this is another blurb from the front of the
rule book, to be ignored like so many before it, the GM helping you
roll up your character may insist that you explain the choices you
make with reference to your character's persona and history, as will
the guild membership tribunal --- so start thinking about it now.

The most fundamental choices are those of race and whether or not to
be a magic user.  You must roll dice to determine race but may choose
magic college freely.  Ask your friends or GM to precis the races and
magic colleges for you if you are unsure, but be aware that, no matter
how unbiased they try to be, any GM will have more experience of some
areas than others and hence cannot help but be a little biased.


\subsection{The Character Tribunal}

At Guild meetings there are a number of GMs with the particular task
of validating a newly generated character. This service is to help
make sure that nothing has gone wrong with the character generation.
It is also to get the character to join the Guild and to welcome new
players.

\subsection{Guild Meetings}

Guild meetings are held four times a year.  They are normally held in
the Lower Common Room at Auckland University. They start at 1pm and
finish at about 4pm on the second Sunday of March, June, September and
December.

At Guild meetings you will be able to get updates for your rulebook.
It is up to you to maintain your own rulebook.

Another service available at the Guild meetings is ``The Seagate Times''
Newsletter.

\subsection{Getting a Rulebook}

You can place an order for a rule book at a Guild meeting.  As the
rules are inclined to change from time to time, they are now being
released in a loose leaf format. The purpose of this is so that you
can update your copy of the rules when it becomes dated. With this in
mind you may have to provide your own bindings for the rulebook.

\subsection{Grievance Tribunal}

The grievance tribunal is to help maintain fun and enjoyment within
the game.  If you feel you have been unfairly treated by your GM and
feel you cannot resolve the problem directly with the GM, then you may
take your grievances to the tribunal.  The tribunal represents all GMs
and will adjudicate on the matter.  This should be seen as an option
of last resort.

\section{About the Guild}

\subsection{Purpose}

The Adventurers Guild of Seagate was set up sometime in November 1963,
in response to a need for a common meeting ground for Adventurers.
This enabled the transmission of knowledge and information in relative
safety, resulting in a close-knit and more effective band of
Adventurers.

Since then it has evolved into a fully integrated service
organisation, providing many important functions for the Adventurer.
These include a clearing house for treasure, healing and resurrection
facilities, a library, magic services, skills services, and many
others.

One of the more important functions of the Guild is to provide
arbitration in disputes and ensure justice on behalf of Guild
members. To assist in this regard, the Guild will draft, for a fee
depending on the complexity of the terms, any contract required by a
member, and guarantee arbitration and enforcement of such a
contract. Copies of the contract may be obtained from the Guild on
request.

\subsection{Structure}

The Guild is organised on a ``level'' system.  There are 5 levels in
all, comprising all forms of membership.

\begin{description}
\item[1. Guild Council] These members are the highest level, and form
the Guild Council. The Council comprises five guild members, these
being selected from Deans by the Council. Hence they will also be head
of their particular branch of magic or skill (see 2). The Council
elects the Council Chairman from amongst their number, this position
being the highest attainable in the Guild. The Council may have no
more than two members who have not been an Adventurer member. In this
way, the Guild remains ``by Adventurers, for Adventurers''.

\item[2. Deans] These members are the Heads of the various
departments.  The departments comprise the magic colleges, skills and
services.

\item[3. Department Staff] These members are the other officials of
the guild such as assistant department heads and others with varying
degrees of responsibility.

\item[4. Adventurers] These members form the core of the Guild. They
are the adventurers who are not involved in the running of the Guild,
but utilise the services of the Guild. The Guild exists primarily for
these members.

\item[5. Staff] These members form the working staff of the Guild such
as stable-hands, kitchen staff, and Department staff. They earn a wage
in return for their services, and are full members, hence they may
take advantage of any Guild service.

\end{description}

\subsection{Membership}

\subsubsection{Entry}

Entry to the Guild must be through Adventurer or Staff levels. Each
level recruits from the one below. The only exception is staff, whose
members may move directly to Department Staff. Adventurers and Staff
levels are considered equivalent.

\subsubsection{Membership Agreement}

On acceptance as a probationary member, the prospective member must
sign the standard declaration, the ``The Adventurers Guild: Membership
Agreement''.

\subsubsection{Probationary Membership}

All new Adventurer level members are probationary Guild members for
the first six months. Most probationary members are accepted as full
Guild members at the end of the six months unless they have been come
to the attention of the Guild Grievance Tribunal.  The six months will
start again from that Tribunal date.

\subsubsection{Membership Fees}

The minimum membership charge for a year is 500sp. If a member is
incapable of paying this minimum fee, then the member concerned may
work off this amount in employment at the Guild.

\subsubsection{Guild Tax}

Maintaining a complex such as members currently have at their disposal
inevitably costs money. Therefore, it is necessary to levy a tax on
members' incomes. This tax applies on all gross income generated on
adventure or dealing with the Guild or its members.  The current Guild
taxation rate is 10\%, but this may vary at any time.

\subsubsection{Guild Adventure}

If an Adventure involving Guild Members uses Guild services or
facilties then it is considered to be a Guild Organised Adventure.
The Guild will insist that a contract be signed by every party member
on adventure.  All adventures with a guild-backed contract are
considered to be Guild organised, and the members are obliged to
uphold the contract.

\subsubsection{Valuation and Divinations}

If, on returning with treasure, the party wishes a valuation on any
items, there will be a charge of 2\% of the valued amount to defray
the cost of obtaining divinations, paying the merchants, etc. This
charge is in addition to the tax.


\subsection{Location and Facilities}

The Adventurers Guild is located south of the city of Seagate and on
the other side of the Sweetwater river within the Duchy of Carzarla.

The Guild premises contain:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Residential area, including: sleeping
      quarters (varying quality and cost),
      dining hall, kitchen, bathhouse, and staff

These assume a Rank 11 Enchantment, purification and a true silver
triangle.  Note that major curses with MA greater than the MA of the
Adept cannot be removed.

\subsubsection{Potions: Other than healing potions}

\begin{flushleft}
\emph{Location}: Ground floor - casting chambers \\
\emph{Number of staff}: 2 \\

Garth Winston, is a old human male in his late fifties and he would
stand 5'8" if he stood upright which he does not. He is almost totally
deaf, and if it were not for a large brass hearing horn, he would not
be able to hear at all. He walks slowly and dodders a lot.  He has PB:
10. He is an Alchemist of rank 7.

Specific purpose potions may be purchased if the suitable ingredients,
both physical and magical are available and time permits. Garth spends
a lot of his time making potions for the Guild so there is a 20\%
chance he will be unavailable at any time.

\subsubsection{Other Skills}

Other skills are available and should be negotiated with the
Department concerned.  (See section 2)

Members should be aware that not all departments are represented at
all times. In general however, most departments can be contacted by

concerned. (See section 2).

\subsubsection{Invested Items}

The Guild does not sell Invested Items.  Therefore, to assist members
in the purchase of such items elsewhere, we advise that the cost of
ingredients necessary to perform the investment ritual is as follows:
\begin{flushleft}
Experience Multiple  \x  Rank  \x  Charges / 2
\end{flushleft}
It is to be hoped that with this knowledge the likelihood of our
members being ``ripped off'' will be decreased. However, we remind
members that the charge of successfully performing the ritual is not
100\%, and prices on the open market will therefore reflect this.

\section{Teaching Facilities available}

We have no representative of the Assassin skill. If a member wishes to
learn or train in the Assassin skill, then they will have to make
their own arrangements outside of the Guild.  Because this is an
unlawful skill members are advised to take care when pursuing it.

Fighting skills are taught by the Warrior Department and lessons in
weapons and armour maintenance are provided on request.  Through this
department the member may purchase weapons, armour and general battle
equipment. If the required items are not available at the Guild, the
department can usually provide suitable contacts outside of the
Guild. In general, the member is encouraged to visit the department
concerned and make their own arrangements.

\section{The Cost of Living}
\label{costliving}

All characters have to expend some money to keep themselves when not
on an adventure.

Under this system there are four options available to a player. The
player just choices one of the options for each or all of their
characters.  The options are: Living in a Household, Living in
Lodgings, Guild Employment, Guild Lodgings.

\subsection{Living in a Household}

The necessities, comforts, and luxuries enjoyed by a person represent
their standard of living.

If players would like their characters to live in a Household other
than at the Guild or at an Inn then the following is provided as a
guide. All of the Households below offer characters different
services.  At subsistence, life is poor, but as you spend more money
you end up paying for grounds to be kept, servants to clean, stables
to be maintained, you're yearly clothes are paid for.

This document assumes that a Household is an extended family unit of 4
to 8 people i.e.\ two adults, a grandparent or two children or so.

This is the simplest option for the player. All you need do is choose
a level of life style for the character and pay for it. You can use
the free time as you see fit. This is normally used for training.

\section{A Guide to Ranking}

At times, ranking can appear difficult and unclear.  However, it is
generally worthwhile.

All characters must have a ranking book, so that you have a record of
your character's progression and training. Ranking (training) should
be done before the first night of play in each session. This book
needs to be available for your GM to check, at which point they will
assist you in confirming that your ranking is correct, and then sign
it off.

All abilities cost Experience Points (EP) and/or Time to rank. The
total training time available is that between the conclusion of your
last adventure and the start of your current adventure, minus any time
spent engaged in other activities.

\subsection{Experience and Ranking}

The ultimate reward for adventuring is getting better at adventuring.
Don't expect treasure --- if you want to earn money become an
accountant.  The mechanisms used for monitoring how much better your
character gets are experience points (EP) and ranks (RK).

Experience is awarded on the basis of how well the character is
role-played and how much the character contributes in terms of ideas,
skills and effort.  An averagely role-played character with average
skills, who contributed effort and ideas averagely, should receive
roughly 1450 EP per session.  The exact EP awarded is at the GM's
discretion and will be decreased for uncooperative play or reducing
the enjoyment of the game for the other players.  It will
correspondingly be increased for excellent role-playing and enhancing
the gaming pleasure of all concerned, including the GM.  No experience
is given solely for killing monsters (so if you can find a way around
a fight it will save time and lives) or by gaining treasure.

Experience points are required to advance in anything.  Time spent
training is required to increase proficiency in spells, skills and
weapons.  Adventuring time is required to advance in characteristics
and talents.

EP is spent as per the rules but note the following :-
\begin{itemize}

\item
Spells must be cast at least five times before the next rank can be
achieved.  Casting chambers are available in the Guild, and monitored
on request.

\item
Talents may be ranked only once per game adventuring week.

\item
Weapon skills take 1 week of training to reach Rank 0, and 2 weeks \x
(rank to be achieved) to improve.

\item
Characteristics may only be increased a maximum of 5 above the
original value (when you rolled your character up) and never above
racial maximum.  Perception may be taken to racial maximum
irrespective of starting value.

\item
A characteristic may be increased only once per adventure. This does
not include occasions when a character has had a characteristic
reduced by more than one, for example dying twice in one session.

\item
Skill ranks 8, 9, and 10 must be ratified by a GM and in general
required significant use of the skill.

\item
You may rank any combination of two things at the same time, providing
you don't rank magic (i.e.\  spells or rituals) at the same time as
non-magic (i.e.\ weapons or skills).

\item
Namers may rank 1 name in addition to other forms of ranking.  They
may also substitute ranking names for any other form of ranking.
Hence it is possible for a Namer to be ranking up to three names at
any one time.

\item
All expenditure of EP and time should be logged for your own records
and should be approved by a GM prior to play.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Campaign Time}

Time in the campaign happens at the same rate as that in the ``real''
world i.e.\ one real year equals one game year. However, the calendar in
DQ is set 9 months behind the real world, so that you can make use of
last year's diaries. One week of training will deduct one week from
your training total. If your time is devoted solely to training, you
may train in two related abilities per day; one in the morning, one in
the afternoon. All Weapons, Skills, Languages, and Adventuring Skills
are deemed to be related, as are all Spells, Rituals, and Names.

\subsection{Experience Points}

The only way to gain EP after character generation is by role-playing
with a recognised GM. You will gain EP on adventure for good
role-playing, for using your skills sensibly, and for entertainment.
Divide this EP by your Racial EM modifier. Add this to your unspent EP
total. This is your available EP for Ranking.

\subsection{Ill-gotten Gains}

It was fun, but what do you get out of it? Firstly, the GM will give
you a slip of paper with the character's EP total gained on the
adventure, or write this directly into your ranking book. They should
also specify the start and end dates (game time \& real time) of the
adventure. All monetary or magical gains should be written up and
signed by your GM.


\subsection{Ranking Book}

Clarity is the essence of all good ranking books.  Numerical accuracy
also assists. We suggest that you use a column format, with column
headings of Ability Name; Rank already achieved; Rank(s) being
trained; EP spent; start and end dates; and silver's spent.


\subsubsection{Example Ranking}

{
  \newfontfamily{\rankingtt}[Scale=0.7,Color=blue]{Courier Prime}
  \rankingtt
\begin{tblr}{colspec={Xlllllll},rowsep=0.1mm,hline{3}={blue}}
Name        & Old   & New  & EP    & Start & End   & SP   & EM \\
            & Rk    & Rk   & cost  & Date  & Date  &      &  \\
Healer      & 1     & 2    & 1600  & 1/1   & 14/1  & 300  & N/A \\
PC.         & 10    & 11   & 750   & N/A   & N/A   & N/A  & N/A \\
E.S.P       & 5     & 6    & 600   & 15/1  & 20/1  & N/A  & 100 \\
Total       &       &      & 2950  & 1/1   & 20/1  & 300 \\
\end{tblr}}

The reason why we stress the importance of this is that on the first
night of the session, everyone will want to start playing as soon as
possible, and anything that helps this will be appreciated by all.

\subsection{How to Rank}

All adventurers can learn any skill or weapon, and any magic within
their college. Learning costs EP, time and money.  The following can
be ranked: Skills, Weapons, Spells, and Languages, Names, Rituals,
Talents, Adventurering Skills and Characteristics.

\subsection{Skills}

All skills are assumed to be unranked (i.e.\ unknown) initially. The
first level of competence is Rank 0, and will take eight weeks to
learn. Each subsequent rank will take that number of weeks to reach
(eg; to get to Rank 8 from Rank 7 will take 8 weeks). The EP cost for
ranking Skills is listed in the rulebook.  Some skills require minimum
Characteristic requirements to Rank, or impose EP penalties (or
discounts) for exceptional Characteristics.  You may get an EP
discount of 10\% if you are trained properly. If this is done at the
Guild, it costs 150sp \x (Rank to be achieved min. 1). If no training
is available at all, a 25\% EP penalty is applied.  Achieving Ranks
8,9 and 10 is difficult.  You must find and complete a special task
relating to your skill, with the assistance of a GM, for each of these
Ranks. Rank 10 is the maximum achievable Rank in all Skills.

\subsection{Weapons}

All weapons are assumed to be unranked initially.  Rank 0 in a weapon
takes 1 week. All higher ranks take 2 \x (Rank to be achieved)
weeks. Weapons have individual maximum Ranks between 2 and 10.  EP
costs are detailed in the rulebook.  All Weapons require minimum PS
and MD Characteristics. If you do not fulfil both requirements, you
may not rank a weapon.  You may not get an EP discount for training,
but if no trainer is available, you may not increase in Rank.  The
cost of a trainer is 10 \x (Rank to be achieved squared) silver
pennies.

\subsection{Spells}

If you are an Adept (i.e.\ cast magic), you can rank your spells.
Each spell has an EM, or Experience Multiplier. This is multiplied by
the Rank that you wish to achieve, to give a total EP cost. If the
Adept has MA $>$ 15, (MA - 15) \x 5\% of the EP cost of General Spells
may be discounted. Training time for spells is (Rank to be achieved)
days.  All spells must be cast five times before each new rank is
achieved. As these spells may backfire, these rolls will need to be
made at some stage.  Learning a new spell to Rank 0 takes (EM / 100
rounded up + 1) weeks, but no experience points. If the spell is
taught by the Guild, they will charge you as laid out in
\S\ref{spellprices} of this Handbook.  You can not have more spells
and rituals below rank 6 than your MA characteristic.  Rank 20 is the
Maximum Rank achievable with any Spell (except Geas).

\subsection{Languages}

Spoken Languages have the same time requirement as weapons. They have
EP costs as set out in Table. EP discounts are as for Skills. Note
that knowing the Philosopher Skill may grant an EP discount.

Learning Written Languages is a one-off cost of 1000 EP and 4
weeks. Various discounts may apply, as specified in the rulebook under
languages and philosopher.

\subsection{Names}

Anyone can rank Names, but only Namers and E\&Es gain any normal
advantage from this.  Learning a Generic Name takes one day; learning
an Individual Name takes one week. Ranking a Generic Name takes (Rank
to be achieved) weeks; Ranking an Individual Name takes the same
number of months. No EP is required. Namers get special advantages in
Ranking - refer to the College of Naming Incantations.

\subsection{Rituals}

Rituals are learnt and ranked just like spells, except that Ranking
time is (Rank to be achieved) weeks, rather than days.  MA discount
applies to General Knowledge Rituals.

\subsection{Talents}

For each week of actual, out in the field, adventuring, you can rank
each of your talents once.  No training time is required to rank
Talents. Like Spells and Rituals, each Talent has an EM. No MA
discounts apply to any Talents.

\subsection{Adventuring Skills}

Adventuring Skills are skills used every day by adventurers to
survive, and thus are continually honed. These skills include
Orienteering, Riding, Swimming, Stealth and Climbing.

If you have extensively used an adventuring skill while on adventure,
you may rank this skill without any time requirements. Otherwise,
Ranking time is as per normal skills.

Adventurers are assumed to start off with Rank 0 or more in all these
skills, unless specifically told otherwise. Experience Point costs are
set out in the rulebook.  The Maximum Rank in all these Skills is 10.

\subsection{Characteristics}

\begin{dqtblr}{colspec={Xcc}}
\textbf{Stat} & \textbf{First Point} & \textbf{Extra Points} \\
Fatigue		& 2500 & 2500 \\
Endurance	& 5000 & 2500 \\
Perception	& 1000 & 750 \\
All others	& 5000 & 5000 \\
\end{dqtblr}

\bigskip

Characteristics, or Stats, are generated initially. PS, MD, AG, MA,
WP, EN and FT may not be increased more than five points.  No Stat may
go over Racial Maximum.  Perception may be increased more than the
limit of five times, to a limit of Racial Maximum. You can only
increase a Stat once after each adventure (not including recovering
lost Stats). Recovering lost EN costs 2,500 EP.

\item[Weight of Load (lbs)] The weight, in pounds, that a character is
carrying, rounded off to the nearest entry on the appropriate Physical
Strength row (if the weight is exactly between two entries, use the
greater one).  Note: A mount can carry weight for a character while
they are riding.

\item[Max] The maximum load, in pounds, that a character can carry for
a sustained period of time.

\item[Agility Points Lost] The temporary Agility Point loss suffered
by a character toting the given weight in combat.
