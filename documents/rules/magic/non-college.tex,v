\section{Non-College Magic}
\label{rituals:noncollege}
\index{rituals!non-college}

\subsection{Introduction}

All spells and rituals given in a listing in this section can be
learnt by Adepts of any college.

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[]{Geas}

\range{The Adept must be able to see and communicate with
the target}
\duration{Until  removed, fulfilled or target dies}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{Always successful (see below)}
\resist{Special}
\target{Sentient entity}
\begin{effects}
A geas is an obligation to complete a quest, an injunction against the
performance of a particular action, or a requirement to respond in the
same fashion to particular stimuli.

A being to be compelled must acknowledge their acceptance of the geas.
Furthermore, the Adept must believe that the being deserves the geas,
or the being must truly wish (not forced by physical or magical means)
to have an unmerited geas placed upon them.  The Adept specifies the
nature of the geas in 25 words or less, and the GM will use the most
liberal interpretation of that wording to the benefit of the compelled
being.  Rank with the geas spell does not affect the chance of casting
the spell as it is always automatically successful.  The Rank equals
the effectiveness of the geas, expressed in percentage terms.  If a
geased being directly contravenes the letter of a geas, they have a
chance of dying equal to the Rank of the geas.  A compelled being will
begin to feel weak or ill when they first take an action counter to
the restriction of the geas, and will become increasingly afflicted
until they once more comply with the geas.  There is no limit to the
Rank of a geas.

If a quest geas is fulfilled by the compelled being, they are no
longer subject to that geas.  The other two types of geas (for and
against a given action) last indefinitely.  A geas can be removed
automatically by the one who placed it upon the compelled being.  A
geased person will not attempt to free themself from the compulsion.
An Adept with Rank greater than that of the geas may try to do so.
The Adept must inscribe a triangle about the compelled, and perform
the ritual of geas removal for 12 consecutive hours.  If the triangle
is silver or True-silver, the compelled being does not suffer the
penalties for ignoring the geas during the ritual.

The Adept attempting to remove the geas has a success chance equal to
five times the difference between their Rank with geas and the Rank of
the geas being removed.  The GM rolls percentile dice: if the roll is
less than or equal to the success percentage, the geas is removed. If
the roll is greater than the success percentage, the Rank of the geas
is increased by one.

\textbf{Full Geas} A being with Rank greater than 50 with the geas
spell has the power of full geas. A full geas can be placed upon a
being without their consent, though it can be passively resisted.
Additionally, one with the power of full geas may automatically remove
(without the support of a triangle and 12 hours of ritual) a geas
which is at least 5 Ranks less than their Rank with the spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[]{Major Curse}
\label{noncollege:majorcurse}
\index{curse!major}

\range{20 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Until removed or target dies}
\multiple{750}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Passive (unless a Death-curse)}
\target{Entity or Object}
\begin{effects}
An Adept's Endurance value is decreased by one whenever they inflict a
major curse upon a being.  Note that when casting a Death-curse this
Endurance point loss is in addition to any possible Endurance point
loss due to resurrection.  There are several types of major curses:
\begin{Description}
\item[Affliction] The Adept may choose to torment or kill their
target. If the effects of the affliction curse are intended to be
deadly, the target may not die as a direct result of the curse before
(24 - Rank) hours have passed.  The following list of sample
affliction curses is provided to give the GM a guideline as to what
major curses should be allowed in their campaign.
\begin{Enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item
Target becomes totally blind, deaf or mute.

\item
Target becomes senile. 

\item
Target suffers from a contagious disease (for example open running sores). 

\item
Target is transformed into a frog or other small creature.

\item
Target becomes weakened and enfeebled and must be helped with any
physical action.
\item
Target falls into century-long sleep.
\end{Enumerate}

\item[Ill  Luck]
Add two times the Rank of the major curse spell to any percentile roll
involving the target or the use any of their abilities.  This may not
be applied favourably.

\item[Doom]
A doom is a pronouncement, by the Adept, upon an event that will occur
in the target's future (Example: ``You will die by the hand of a loved
one.'').  The statement which must be indefinite, will be true unless
removed.  The GM should be careful as to what to allow for dooms.

\item[Death-curse]
At the moment of their death, an Adept may automatically cast a major
curse (unless backfire occurs).  The being at which it is cast may not
resist the curse.  A death-curse must be an affliction, ill luck or
doom.  If a doom, it will be gasped out with the Adept's final breath.

\item[Note]
Lycanthropy is considered a major curse.
\end{Description}
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[]{Remove Curse}
\label{ritual:removecurse}
\index{curse!remove curse ritual}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{500}
\resist{None}
\target{A curse}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
Every curse is rated by the Magical Aptitude (MA) of the Adept who
cast it.  If the curse is natural (such as Lycanthropy) it usually has
an MA of 20.

There are two types of curses, minor ones and major ones.  A minor
curse causes its victim to suffer from a non-fatal malediction.  Minor
curses come from various sources, for example the spells Evil Eye (G-9
of the College of Ensorcelments and Enchantments), the Damnum Minatum
(G-1 of the Witchcraft College) and certain backfires.  Major curses
normally comes from the Major Curse spell (\S \ref{noncollege:majorcurse}).

When a ritual of curse removal has been completed, the GM rolls
percentile dice.  If the roll is less than or equal to the success
percentage the curse is removed. If the roll is between one and two
times the success percentage, the curse remains in effect.  If the
roll is equal to or greater than twice the success percentage, the MA
of the curse is increased by one.  This ritual does not backfire in
the normal fashion.

\textbf{Minor Curse}

\basechance{(15 - MA of curse + 5 \x Rank )\%}
\casttime{6 hours}
\actions{Inscribe symbol of power}
The Adept must inscribe a triangle or symbol of power about the cursed
being, and perform this ritual for six consecutive hours.

\textbf{Major Curse}

\basechance{(Adept's MA - MA of curse + 2 \x Rank)\%}
\casttime{18 hours}
\actions{Inscribe symbol of power}
The Adept must have a Magical Aptitude greater than that of the curse.
They must inscribe a triangle or symbol of power about the cursed
being, and perform this ritual for eighteen consecutive hours.  If the
major curse is a death-curse, add only one times the Rank.

\textbf{Precious Metals}

The use of triangles or symbols of power fashioned of varying amounts
of precious metals causes an addition to the success percentage, per
the following schedule:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xcr}
\textbf{Metal} & \textbf{Add} & \textbf{Cost} \\
Silver      & +  3 &  1,000 sp \\
Gold        & +  7 & 10,000 sp \\
Platinum    & + 10 & 15,000 sp \\
Truesilver  & + 15 & 20,000 sp \\
\end{tabularx}

The symbol necessary for this ritual is large enough for the target to
sit in, and is inscribed in the ground.  This symbol may be portable.

\section{College Rituals}
\label{college:rituals}

\begin{multicols}{3}

\subsection{Introduction}

This section includes those rituals that are common to all 
Colleges.  Note however, that these rituals are still specific
to a College so an adept can only learn them from another adept
of the same college.

\subsection{Ritual Spell Preparation}
\label{magic:preparation}

\subsubsection{General Knowledge Ritual}

For each hour spent in preparation, the Base Chance of the spell is
increased by 3 (up to a maximum of 30 if 10 full hours are spent in
preparation).  If, at any time during the preparation, the Adept's
concentration is broken, the entire process must be restarted from
scratch or abandoned and any time previously spent in preparation is
lost.  A Adepts's concentration is always broken if combat occurs
during the ritual.  The Adept may engage in no other activity
while preparing the spell.  The spell must be cast immediately upon
completing the Ritual Preparation.  The Spell Preparation Ritual is a
General Knowledge Ritual.  An Adept cannot achieve Rank with this
Ritual.

\subsection{Purification}
\label{colleged:purfication}

An Adept may increase their Magic Resistance by 5 and their Magical
Aptitude by 1 for each hour spent in Ritual Purification.

\subsubsection{General Knowledge Ritual}

\begin{spelldesc}
{\em Duration:} (D10 + Rank) \x hours spent purifying \\
{\em Experience Multiple:} 200 \\
{\em Time Taken:} 1, 2 or 3 hours \\
\end{spelldesc}
Ritual Purification always increases both Magic Resistance and Magical
Aptitude by the aforementioned amounts for each hour spent in
purification up to a maximum of 3 hours (for a total increase of 15 to
Magic Resistance and 3 to Magical Aptitude). An Adept can only be
under the influence of one Ritual Purification at a given time.  The
effects of the purification last for a number of hours equal to (Rank
with Ritual Purification + D1O) \x the number of hours spent in
purification.  The die is always rolled by the GM who keeps the result
secret until it is time to inform the players that the result of a
purification has worn off.  The ritual is always interrupted by the
necessity of suspending the Adventure Sequence and employing the
Tactical Procedure and must be abandoned or restarted from scratch
with all hours spent in purification being lost.  However, once a
Ritual Purification has been completed, the Adept can enter combat and
employ all of the benefits of the purification.  An Adept must
announce when they start a purification the number of hours they will
spend engaged in the ritual.  They may engage in no other activity
(including moving, resting, or employing other special preparations)
while engaged in this ritual.  Ritual Purification is a General
Knowledge Ritual.

\subsection{The Ward Ritual (Ver 1.1)}
\label{colleged:ward}

\subsubsection{Special Knowledge Ritual}
a4 177
\begin{spelldesc}
\emph{Duration:} Until triggered \\
\emph{Experience Multiple:} 400 \\
\emph{Base Chance:} MA (+ 3\% / Rank) \\
\emph{Resist:} No \\
\emph{Target:} Volume \\
\emph{Cast Time:} 1 hour \\
\emph{Materials:} None \\
\emph{Actions:} Concentration \\
\emph{Concentration Check:} Standard \\
\end{spelldesc}
\emph{Effects:}
An entity may employ Ritual Magic to set a Ward over an area which
they occupy.

A Ward is a spell which is activated by the entry or exit of objects
or entities into the volume it occupies. Whenever an entity wants to
create a Ward, they engage in one or more hours of Ritual Preparation
to create the Ward.  At the end of the preparation, they check to see
if the Ward is set by making a Cast Check.  If the Cast Check is
successful, the Ward is set. If the Check is not successful, no Ward
exists.

It is possible to backfire from an attempt to create a Ward.  In such
cases, the spell being incorporated into the Ward backfires
immediately. This is rolled for on the backfire table as though a
normal Cast Check had resulted in the backfire.

Once the Ward is cast, the entry or exit of any object or being in the
area occupied by the Ward (determined by the range of the spell
incorporated into the Ward) may trigger the Ward.  The area that the
Ward occupies and the range of the spell incorporated into the Ward
are identical.  This means that most spells (Range 15' + 15 rank) have
a minimum sized ward of 30' diameter (a sphere, centred on the caster,
of 15'radius).  Also, note that many spells have an indefinite range
and hence cannot be incorporated into a Ward.  This includes spells
with ranges of unlimited, self, or touch and spells that can only
affect the adept.  Once a ward has been triggered, it ceases to
exist. It takes full effect on the entity(s) or object(s) that
triggered it, but is dissipated thereafter. It takes full but normal
effect on the target(s) -- there is no possibility for a double or
triple effect (nor for failure or backfire).  Note that a Ward set up
for triggering by an entity or object exiting the area cannot be a
targeted spell, since the target would no longer be within range. The
exiting method of triggering is still useful for area of effect spells
that don't have a specific target.  All Wards emanate from the exact
spot occupied by the individual who cast the Ward (important for
determining range).  Note that there are a couple of spells that can
have an effect beyond their range.

Spells that are not suitable for incorporation into a Ward are those
which require concentration, or some other action by the Adept.  A
Ward always consists of only one spell. More than one Ward may not be
set over a specific area. Any attempt to set a Ward on an area that
overlaps another Ward will fail. The adept will only become aware of
this if they would otherwise have been successful.

Whenever creating a Ward, the Adept must also specify under what
conditions the Ward will be triggered.  They may decide not to limit
its affect, in which case the ward will be triggered by anyone or
anything entering the area over which it is set, or they may limit it
to affecting specific individuals or anything in between.  Thus, an
Adept could set a Ward that would only be triggered by the entry or
exit of a troll. If a multi-target spell is required to hit more than
one target from a Ward, then the trigger must include the number of
beings.  For example, a spell which affects three targets could be set
up to be triggered by three trolls.  The instant that the third troll
entered the volume the Ward would be triggered, but prior to that any
number of lone trolls could have freely moved through the Ward.

A Ward, once it is successfully set, cannot be triggered until the
caster leaves the volume of the Ward.  Specifics of the triggering
mechanism must be something intrinsic to the object or entity (similar
to Detect Aura). Hence a Ward could be set up to be triggered by a
Rank 4 or higher assassin, but could not be constructed to trigger on
the assassin known as Mac the Knife. In order to affect, or exclude,
specific people, those people's Individual True Names may be
incorporated into the Ward, with a sufficiently detailed description
so as to identify the individual. If Individual True Names are
incorporated then there is no possible way to determine what those
names are, but a Divination would reveal the number of people
specifically affected, or excluded.  A Ward cannot recognise a
specific object, but merely an instance of an object.  For example,
``my sword'' could not be included in the triggering mechanism, but a
``magical sword with a yak-hide grip'' could be.  A Ward cannot tell
the time so a Ward cannot include such phrases as ``after x minutes''
or ``at midnight''.  Nor does a Ward have any memory, so in cannot be
set up to be triggered by the third troll to pass.

Once a Ward is set, any entity or object which could trigger the Ward
and which enters the area occupied by the Ward is automatically
subject to whatever spell was woven into the Ward.  Only those spells
known by the caster of the Ward may be woven into the Ward and they
take effect exactly as if the caster of the Ward were present and
casting at the spot occupied by the entity when they set the Ward.
All entities or objects nearby which would normally be affected by the
spell are subject to its effects when it is cast as a result of the
Ward being triggered. Note that for entities or objects to be affected
they must be within the volume that the Ward occupied, with the
exception of those spells which can affect beyond their range.
Targeted spells can only affect what is incorporated in the triggering
mechanism.

Wards are dispelled in one of two ways: either by a Namer casting the
appropriate Counterspell of the same College incorporated into the
Ward, or by being triggered by an entity or object. The Adept who set
the Ward may always counterspell their own spells, and hence they can
dissipate their own wards by casting a counterspell into it.  Wards
exist in perpetuity until dispelled.

\subsection{The Investment Ritual}
\label{investment}

\subsubsection{Special Knowledge Ritual}

\begin{spelldesc}
{\em Experience Multiple:} 300 \\
{\em Base Chance:} MA (+ 3 / Rank) + 3 / hour in preparation \\
{\em Target:} Object \\
{\em Cast Time:} Up to 10 hours \\
\end{spelldesc}
An adept may store the a spell in an object by employing the Investment
Ritual.

The Adept must state the number of hours that will be spent in the
ritual, the object to be invested, the number of charges, and the
specific spell to be stored in the object.  At the end of the ritual,
the character's player makes a Ritual Check to determine if the ritual
has been effective.  The Chance of the ritual being effective is equal
to the Adept's Magical Aptitude plus 3 for each hour spent in the
ritual (to a maximum of 10 hours) plus any other modifiers normally
associated with spells and rituals (+ 3 per Rank with the Investment
Ritual).  If the Cast Check dice roll is equal to or less than the
Cast Chance, the object of the ritual is invested with the spell.

If the ritual backfires, then the effect is as if the spell to be
invested had just backfired.  If the ritual has a double or triple
effect then the number of charges to be invested in the item can be
doubled or tripled respectively.

An object which has a spell stored in it in this manner may be used to
cast the spell at no Fatigue cost by any sentient entity (even those
who are not a member of a college).  People who know how to trigger
the item are the adept who invested the item, an Adept who has
divinated the item, or any person who has had 15 minutes of
instruction by another person who knows how to use the item.  Many
Adepts use the same triggering technique so that someone who knows how
to trigger one of their items, will also know how to trigger other
items invested by the Adept.  It is not necessary for an entity to
know the spell stored in an object in order to trigger it.

Each object invested with spell power in this manner has a number of
``charges'' in it equal to the Rank the Adept who invested the
object possessed with the Investment Ritual at the time the item was
invested.  Whenever the item is used, the number of remaining charges
is reduced by one.  When no charges remain, the item is no longer
invested with the power of the spell.  It may be reinvested.  A
particular object may never be invested with more than one spell at
the same time.  An Adept may only invest an object with a spell they
know.  When a spell is triggered it emanates from the entity who
triggered the item, but is treated in all other ways as if cast by the
entity who originally invested the object with the spell. Hence, an
invested item has a Rank (that of the Adept with the spell when they
invested it) and a Base Chance (that of the Adept at the exact moment
that they invested it).  Any adjustments to Base Chance can only be
applied at the time of investment, and any adjustments to the dice
roll can only be applied at the time of triggering.  A spell invested
in an object may only be dispelled (i.e., removed and dissipated) by a
Namer casting the proper counterspell over it.  When an object
invested with a spell is used, any backfire resulting from its use
affects the user of the object rather than the object itself.

\end{spelldesc}
\emph{Effects:}
A character may employ Ritual Magic to cast a Ward over an area which
he occupies or is near.

A Ward is an automatic spell which is activated by the intrusion of
objects or living beings into the area it occupies. By ``intrusion'' we
mean entry or exit.  ``Area'' means volume.  Whenever a character wishes
to create a Ward, he announces his intention and engages in one or
more hours of Ritual Preparation to create the Ward.  At the end of
the preparation, he immediately checks to see if the Ward is cast by
making a Cast Check.  If the Cast Check is successful, the Ward is
cast.  If the Check is not successful, no Ward exists and the attempt
must be started from scratch or abandoned.

It is possible to backfire from an attempt to create a Ward.  In such
cases, the spell being incorporated into the Ward backfires
immediately. This is rolled for on the backfire table as though a
normal Cast Check had resulted in the backfire.

Once the Ward is cast, the entry or exit of any object or being in the
area occupied by the Ward (determined by the range of the spell
incorporated into the Ward) may trigger the Ward.  The area that the
Ward occupies and the range of the spell incorporated into the Ward
are identical.  This means that most spells (Range 15' + 15 rank) have
a minimum sized ward of 30' diameter (a sphere, centred on the caster,
of 15'radius).  Also, note that many spells have an indefinite range
and hence cannot be incorporated into a Ward.  This includes spells
with ranges of unlimited, self, or touch and spells that can only
affect the adept.  Once a ward has been triggered, it ceases to
exist. It takes full effect on the character(s) or object(s) that
triggered it, but is dissipated thereafter. It takes full but normal
effect on the target(s) -- there is no possibility for a double or
triple effect (nor for failure or backfire).  Note that a Ward set up
for triggering by an entity or object exiting the area cannot be a
targeted spell, since the target would no longer be within range. The
exiting method of triggering is still useful for area of effect spells
that don't have a specific target.  All Wards emanate from the exact
spot occupied by the individual who cast the Ward (important for
determining range).  Note that there exists a couple of spells that
can have an effect beyond their range.

Spells that are not suitable for incorporation into a Ward are
those which require concentration only, (concentration/maximum are
okay), or some other action by the adept.  A Ward always consists of
only one such spell, however.  More than one Ward may not be cast over
a specific area (i.e. it is not possible to cast three or four
different spells over the same doorway via a Ward). Any attempt to
cast a Ward on an area that overlaps another Ward will fail. The adept
will only become aware of this if they would otherwise have been
successful.

Whenever he announces that he is creating a Ward, a character's player
must also announce under what conditions the Ward will be triggered.
They may decide not to limit its affect, in which case the ward will
be triggered by anyone or anything entering the area over which it is
cast, or he may limit ft to affecting specific individuals or anything
in between.  Thus, a character could cast a Ward that would only be
triggered by passing trolls (or even more specifically, by the third
troll to pass through the area occupied by the Ward).  By pass
through, either entry or exit is meant. If a multi-target spell is
required to hit more than one target from a Ward, then the trigger
must include the number of beings. For example, a rank 7 hellfire
(which affects 3 characters) could be set up to be triggered by 3
passing trolls.  The instant that the third troll entered the area the
ward would be triggered, but prior to that any number of lone trolls
could have freely moved through the ward.  Characters (and the GM)
should be aware that it may be necessary to account for the caster of
the Ward and his fellow adventurers having to pass through the Ward.

Since we have agreed that wards cannot tell time, then delaying the
start time of a ward is contradictory.  Hence, if a group is involved
then this must be taken into account when stipulating the trigger of
the ward. A Ward, once it is successfully cast cannot be triggered
until the caster leaves the area of the Ward.  Specifics of the
triggering mechanism must be something intrinsic to the object or
entity (similar to Detect Aura). Hence a Ward could be set up to be
triggered by a rank 4 or higher assassin, say, but could not be
constructed to trigger on the assassin known as Mac the Knife. In
order to affect, or exclude, specific people, those people's
Individual True Names may be incorporated into the Ward, or a
description of sufficient detail as required by the Locate spell. If
an individual true name is incorporated then there is no possible way
to determine what those names are, but a Divination would reveal the
number of people specifically affected, or excluded.  A Ward cannot
recognise a specific object, but merely an instance of an object For
example, ``my sword'' could not be included in the triggering
mechanism, but a ``magical sword with a yak-hide grip'' could be.

Once a Ward is in effect, any individual or object which could trigger
the Ward and which enters the area occupied by the Ward is
automatically subject to whatever individual spell was woven into the
Ward.  See paragraph three for a more complete explanation.  Only
those spells known by the caster of the Ward may be woven into the
Ward and they take effect exactly as if the caster of the Ward were
present and casting at the spot occupied by the character or object
which triggered the Ward. All characters or objects nearby which would
normally be affected by the spell are subject to its effects when it
is cast as a result of the Ward being triggered. Note that for
characters or objects to be affected they must be within the area that
the Ward occupied, with the exception of those spells which can affect
beyond their range. Targeted spells can only affect what is
incorporated in the triggering mechanism.

Wards are dispelled in one of two ways: either by a Namer casting a
Counterspell of the same College incorporated into the Ward, or by
being triggered by an individual or object.  Note that the
Counterspell is require to be of the same type as the warded spell,
that is General Knowledge Counterspell for a warded General Knowledge
spell, and a Special Knowledge Counterspell for a Special Knowledge
spell.  The caster may always counterspell their own spells, and hence
they can disapate their own wards by casting a counterspell into it.
They exist in perpetuity until dispelled.  Wards cannot tell the time.

The cost to learn it varies for each College and is printed in the
Guild Handbook.  Greater Summoners and Rune Mages currently have
little or no use for the Ward Ritual.  The presence of cold iron does
not affect a Ward.

\subsection{The Investment Ritual}
\label{investment}

A character may store the power of a spell in an object in their
possession by employing an Investment Ritual.

\begin{flushleft}
{\em Experience Multiple:} 300 \\
{\em Base Chance:} MA (+ 3 / Rank) + 3 / hour in preparation \\
{\em Time Taken:} Up to 10 hours \\
\end{flushleft}

The character's player announces that he is beginning an Investment
Ritual and states the number of hours that will be spent in the
ritual, the object to be invested with power, and the specific spell
which will be stored in the object.  At the end of the ritual, the
character's player makes a Cast Check to determine if the ritual has
been effective.  The Chance of the ritual being effective id always
equal to the character's Magical Aptitude plus 3 for each hour spent
in the ritual (up to a maximum of 10 hours or 30 percentage points)
plus any other modifiers normally associated with spells and rituals
(+ 3 per Rank with the investment Ritual).  It is possible to generate
any of the effects normally associated with spells when an Invested
spell is loosed (double or triple effect, backfire, etc.)  using this
ritual.  If the Cast Check dice roll is equal to or less than the Cast
Chance, the object of the ritual is invested with the power of the
spell which to be stored in it.

An object which has a spell stored in it in this manner may be used to
cast the spell at no Fatigue cost by any character (including
individuals who are not members of a College of magic) who knows how
to activate the object.  Only those individuals who know the
Investment Ritual of the College that was used to store the spell in
the object or who have been told by the character who stored the spell
in the object how to activate the power therein may use the object's
power.  It is not necessary for a character to know the spell stored
in an object in order to employ the object to release the spell.

Each object invested with spell power in this manner has a number of
"charges" in it equal to the Rank the character who invested the
object possessed with the Investment Ritual at the time the item was
invested.  Whenever the power in the item is used, the number of
remaining charges is reduced by 1.  When no charges remain, the item
is no longer invested with the power of the spell.  It may be
reinvested.  A particular object may never be invested with more than
one spell at the same time.  A character may only invest an object
with a spell he knows.  Whenever a spell is released from an object in
which it was invested, the spell is treated as if it was being cast by
the character who originally stored it in the object.  It always
emanates from the spot occupied by the object, but is treated in all
other ways as if cast by that character as he was when he originally
invested the object with the spell power (ie. the spell would be
ranked as it was when originally stored in the object).  A spell
invested in an object may only be dispelled (ie. removed and
dissipated) by a Namer casting the proper counterspell over it. If an
attempt at investing an object with a spell's power backfires, the
effect is as if the spell being invested in the object had backfired.
It is applied immediately.  When an object invested with a spell is
used, any backfire resulting from its use affects the user of the
object rather than the object itself.  The Investment Ritual is a
Special Knowledge Ritual.

When a ritual of curse removal has been completed, the GM rolls
percentile dice.  If the roll is less than or equal to the success
percentage the curse is removed. If the roll is between one and two
times the success percentage, the curse remains in effect.  If the
roll is equal to or greater than twice the success percentage, the MA
of the curse is increased by one.

The spells and rituals described in this section are used by Adepts
for vengeance upon adventuring beings.  Usually, magic is intended to
cause an immediate effect; the consequences of these abilities will,
however, dog the unfortunate adventurer for great lengths of time.
The cost to use these powerful magics is high: the caster must either
make personal sacrifices, or spend a great deal of time to implement
one spell or ritual.

\subsubsection{All spells and rituals given in a listing in this
section can be used by Adepts of any college.}

Except where noted in the effects part of a description, an Adept
casts the spells and rituals herein via the usual procedures for
magic.

A being to be compelled must acknowledge his acceptance of the geas.
d76 24
a99 26
or the being must truly wish (that is is not forced by physical or
magical means) to have an unmerited geas placed upon him.  The caster
specifies the nature of the geas in 25 words or less, and the GM
will use-the most liberal interpretation of that wording to the
benefit of the compelled being.  A caster's Rank with the geas spell
does not affect his chance of casting the spell; he is always
automatically successful if he satisfies the pre-requisites. The Rank
equals the effectiveness of the geas, expressed in percentage
terms.  If a geased being directly contravenes the letter of a geas,
he has a chance of dying equal to the caster's Rank with the geas
spell at the time it was cast upon him.  A compelled being will begin
to feel weak or ill when he first takes an action counter to the
restriction of the geas, and will become increasingly afflicted as
he pays less and less attention to the letter of the geas.  There is
no limit to the Rank of a geas.

If the letter of a quest geas is fulfilled by the compelled being, he
is no longer subject to that geas.  The other two types of geas (for
and against a given action) last indefinitely.  A geas can be removed
automatically by the one who placed it upon the compelled being.  A
geased person cannot attempt to free himself from the compulsion, but
may have an Adept with Rank greater than that of his geas try to do
so.  The Adept must inscribe a triangle about the compelled, and
perform the ritual of geas removal for 12 consecutive hours. If the
triangle is silver, the compelled being does not suffer the penalties
for ignoring the geas during the ritual.

\textbf{Full Geas} If one has a Rank greater than 50 with the geas
spell, he has the power of full geas. A full geas can be placed upon a
being without his consent, though he may passively (but not actively)
resist such a geas.  Additionally, one with the power of full geas may
automatically remove (without the support of a triangle and 12 hours
of ritual) a geas which is at least 5 Ranks less than his Rank with
the spell.

\subsection{Minor Curse}

A minor curse causes its victim to suffer from a non-fatal
malediction.

The spells Evil Eye (G-9 of the College of Ensorcelments and
Enchantments), the Damnum Minatum (G-1 of the College of Witchcraft)
and backfire (see 30) results above a roll of 61 are minor curses.
