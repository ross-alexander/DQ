@\begin{college}[1.3]{celestial}{Celestial Magics}{CE}

The College of Celestial Magics is concerned with the practice of
those magic arts having to do with the elements of light and dark and
their contrasts.  There are four distinct divisions of the College of
Celestial Magics, each of which is concerned with a different
combination of light and dark

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Solar Mages    & - Light \\
Star Mages     & - Light within Dark \\
Shadow Weaving & - Dark within Light \\
Dark Mages     & - Dark \\
\end{tabular}

Solar \& Star Mages use the element of Light, and Shadow Weavers
and Dark Mages use the element of Darkness. 

All members of the college must be associated with only one division
of this College, and may only change divisions by forsaking their
present division, and relearning the new division as if it were a
different college.

Most entities are aligned with either Light or Dark, and Celestial
Magics will often only affect entities of the opposed aspect.
Entities' fear of their opposing element gives this College special
power.  Whether an entity is Light aspected, Dark aspected, or has
neither aspect, is determined per the rules given in Light and Dark
Aspect(\S\ref{celestial:aspect}).

\subsection{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Celestial Magics may not practise their arts
in an area where their element is not present.

A Magical Aptitude of 14 is required to learn this College. 

Note also that certain spells of this college may only be learnt by
specific divisions (as listed after the Spell Number).

\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}

The Base Chance of performing any talent, spell, or ritual of the
College of Celestial Magics is modified by the following numbers,
based on the division to which the adept belongs.

\subsubsection{Aspect modifiers}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Solar Mage with a Solar Aspect & +1\% \\
Solar Mage with a Lunar Aspect  & -1\% \\
Dark Mage with a Solar Aspect  & -1\% \\
Dark Mage with a Lunar Aspect  & +1\% \\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Lighting condition modifiers}

An Adept of Celestial Magics is affected greatly by the lighting
conditions in their vicinity. The bonuses and penalties gained in this
section apply only to non-magical forms of Light and Dark. Magical
forms of the elements may at best neutralise any penalties suffered
due to the natural elements. For the purposes of these modifiers the
vicinity is deemed to be any bounded area around the Adept (such as a
room); or, if the Adept is in the open, the area within 30' of the
Adept.

Shadow Weavers must be within a shadow that has a defined edge within
the vicinity (the shadow must be large enough to contain the Adept,
and can not be generated from the Adept's possessions), and Star Mages
must be in direct light from point sources (eg; casting a shadow),
otherwise the lighting condition modifier is -25\%.

The lighting modifiers are in the Celestial Lighting Modifiers table
(\S\ref{table-lighting}).

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Speak to Creatures of Light/Darkness}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{50}
\resist{None}
\begin{effects}
This talent allows the adept to communicate in a limited fashion with
non-sentient creatures.  A Solar Mage or Star mage may communicate
with those creatures who are light aspected, whereas a Shadow Weaver
or Dark Mage may communicate with those creatures who are dark
aspected.  The talent is limited to a range of 10' (+ 10' / Rank),
and the communication is equivalent to a language skill of 1 (+ 1 for
every 5 full Ranks).  The communication is a combination of spoken and
sign language.  If either vision or sound is not possible then the
talent operates at half its actual Rank (round down).  Moreover, if
neither of these senses are available then the talent cannot function
at all.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Night Vision}

\range{50 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Always active}
\multiple{100}
\begin{effects}
This talent allows the adept to see in the dark with vision similar to
that of a cat.  Everything will appear monochromatic (\ie shades of
grey) and it is difficult to accurately estimate distance.  The higher
the Rank, the less of a problem this will be.  Because the vision is
monochromatic it cannot be used to do a Detect Aura.  Note that some
amount of light must be present before any sort of vision is possible.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-3]{Detect Aura}

\range{Special}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{Perception + 5\% / Rank}
\resist{Active}
\begin{effects}
The effects of this talent are described in \S \ref{magic:detect-aura}.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Blending}

\range{15 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{50}
\basechance{60\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Once this spell is cast, the target must remain still in order for it
to have effect.  While remaining still the target is not able to be
seen by non-magical means (\ie as for invisibility).  If the target
moves, the spell ceases to work.  However, if the target becomes still
again during the duration of the spell, it will resume its effect.
The duration of the spell refers to the time since casting, not the
time that the spell is actually in effect (\ie while the target is
still).

Keeping still will require (as a minimum) a 4 \x WP check every
hour.  The target may be required to make additional willpower checks
at the GM's discretion.

The spell only has effect while the target is ``still''.  This means
that the target is unable to move any of its external surfaces, with
limited exceptions.  Moving an external surface encompasses such
actions as moving a limb, or opening and closing the mouth.  Blinking
and normal bodily movement caused by normal breathing will not
constitute moving for the purposes of this spell.  The following
actions will automatically cause the spell to cease working: talking,
spell casting, triggering (subject to any revision of the Investment
ritual) readying a weapon, altering facing in a hex, moving from the
hex, using a silent language, or indeed any Action other than a Pass
action (and Pass actions being restricted as outlined).  Note that it
is not relevant if an observer would see the movement for the spell to
cease working (\eg moving hands behind back, or talking behind hand
will both cause the spell to cease having an effect).

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Light}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{15 minutes \x [D - 5] \x [Rank]}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a volume in which non-magical darkness is partially
suppressed. The volume will be 1000 (+ 500 / Rank) cubic feet, and may
be in any one contiguous area the Adept desires, provided that no
dimension is smaller than one foot. The entire volume must be visible
and within range at time of casting, and may not be moved. For
visibility purposes, the Spell will increase Lighting levels within
the volume to 60\% + 2\% / Rank. Rank 20 Light may not be seen
through. It will not aid in providing bonuses for casting purposes,
though it will neutralise penalties due to natural darkness, to a
maximum of 5\% + 1\% / Rank.  The volume counts as direct light for
Star \& Shadow Mages.  If the lighting conditions are higher than that
provided by the spell, no effect will be apparent. Note that because
darkness is being suppressed, no light is generated, so any area
outside the volume will not be lit. This spell can engender
silhouettes, though not create shadows. If it is not possible to see
into a lit volume, then objects within the volume are not visible. Any
of this volume may be overridden by a higher ranked Spell of Darkness,
or neutralised (back to original conditions) by an equal rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Darkness}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{15 minutes \x [D - 5] \x [Rank]}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a volume in which non-magical light is partially
suppressed. The volume will be 1000 (+ 500 / Rank) cubic feet, and may
be in any one contiguous area the Adept desires, provided that no
dimension is smaller than one foot. The entire volume must be visible
and within range at time of casting, and may not be moved. For
visibility purposes, the Spell will increase Darkness levels within
the volume to 60\% + 2\% / Rank. Rank 20 Darkness may not be seen
through. It will not aid in providing bonuses for casting purposes,
though it will neutralise penalties due to natural light, to a maximum
of 5\% + 1\% / Rank. The volume counts as direct shadow for Star \&
Shadow Mages. If the lighting conditions are lower than that provided
by the spell, no effect will be apparent. Note that because light is
only being suppressed, it may still pass through, and no shadows are
generated outside the volume. If it is possible to see through a
Darkness, everything beyond it is normally visible.  This spell can
engender silhouettes of lit objects against the darkness, though not
create shadows. Any of this volume may be overridden by a higher
ranked Spell of Light, or neutralised (back to original conditions) by
an equal rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Shadow Form / Coruscade}

\range{15 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell is enveloped in a confusing pattern of
shadows (for Dark and Shadow) or coruscating pattern of motes of light
(Solar and Star).  Any attempt to physically hit the target with Melee
or Ranged attacks will have 2 (+ 2 / Rank) subtracted from the Strike
Chance.  In Close combat 1 (+ 1 / Rank) is subtracted.  Any attack
made without using the sense of sight (either normal, or for that
particular attack) will not be affected by this spell (\eg a blind
entity, a trample attack).  In almost all circumstances it is quite
apparent when an entity is under the effect of this spell.  No form of
magical vision will aid in avoiding the Strike Chance reduction
produced as a result of this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Wall of Starlight}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
Creates a 10' high, 1' thick, 20' long wall of light, or a 10' high,
l' thick, 5' internal radius ring of light, or a 15' high, 5' diameter
pillar of light.

The adept may increase any dimension by 1' / Rank.  The wall cannot
be cast so as to include any entity within it, other than the Adept.
Any entity who is dark aspected must passively resist or suffer [D -
5] ( + 1 / Rank) damage each time they come within contact with the
wall (not per pulse).  Any entity damaged by the wall must roll on the
fright table.  The wall created banishes darkness from within its
bounds in the same manner as a Spell of Light of the same Rank.  The
entirety of one edge must be affixed to a surface.  This means that a
wall can be created with a smaller dimension than would otherwise be
possible.  For example, casting a wall of light on a stepping stone
that is 3' square will result in a wall which is only 3' long.  Any
edge may be affixed but, for the purposes of this spell, this does
not include either face.  For example, a wall could not be placed
flat on a large open surface. The surface or surfaces that the Wall
of Light is affixed to do not need to be flat, but the length of the
wall is measured from the deepest depression on the surface that the
wall fills.  For example, a circularly concave wall of 5' radius,
with a rank 0 wall affixed to it will end in a flit edge 15' beyond
the end of the curvature.  The entire anchoring edge must be visible
to the Adept.  The wall itself cannot be moved.  Should an entire
cross-section of the last remaining anchoring edge be removed then the
wall will immediately dissipate.

\begin{example}
An Adept casts a wall 1' off the ground, attached to a door.  As soon
as the door is opened the wall is dissipated.  If, however, the adept
had cast it so that it overlapped the door frame, and it projected
slightly above the top of the door, then it would not have been
dissipated because no entire cross-section of the anchoring edge has
been removed.  In this case somebody with a sharp implement (and quite
a bit of patience) could scratch away at the stone wall until they had
created a groove through the entire cross-section of the Wall of
Starlight in order to make it dissipate.
\end{example}

Note that this spell will not be affected by a Spell of Darkness
except to reduce its lighting effect.

Solar and Star mages get a reduction to the Experience Multiple of 50
(to 100) and +5\% to base chance.

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Wall of Darkness}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell works similarly to the Wall of Starlight Spell, except that
light aspected creatures are affected by it, and it banishes light in
the same manner as a Spell of Darkness of the same Rank.

Shadow and Dark mages get a reduction to the Experience Multiple of 50
(to 100) and +5\% to base chance.

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Witchsight}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may see objects or entities which are invisible and they
appear to have a slight blue sheen around them. If the invisibility
effect (excluding Walking Unseen) is of a higher Rank than the
Witchsight, the object or entity may not be clearly identified or
directly magically targeted. The Adept may also see in the dark as a
Human does on a cloudy day, with an effective range of vision of 150
feet under the open sky, and 75 feet elsewhere.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Walking Unseen}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not invisible.  This
means that it will not transmit light.  As a consequence the target
will cast a shadow (which may or may not be noticed depending on the
lighting etc --- even if noticed may not be connected to the target)
and have a reflection in a mirror (or any reflective surface).
However the target may not be noticed even if another entity is
looking directly at him/her. It should be noted that a crystal of
vision or similar would count as looking directly at the target, not
as a reflection.  An entity will get a perception check if the target
becomes invasive on that entity's senses (\eg standing in a frontal
adjacent hex, or standing behind the entity with the target's hands
over his/her eyes).  Although the target is not invisible, it may be
detected using any magical means for detecting invisible entities (\eg
witchsight).

If the target of the spell, or the target's possessions, are touched
by another entity, or that entity's possessions, then the spell is
broken.  The target of the spell may not break it voluntarily (other
than by, for example, touching another entity). Once broken the spell
must be recast.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9 Solar]{Resistance to Light}

\range{Self}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
While under the effects of this spell, an adept gains 2\% (+ 2 / Rank)
to the chance of resisting magical, light-based attacks.  This
includes Flash of Light, Wall of Starlight, Bolt of Starfire, Web of
Light, Solar Flare and Whitefire.  The target will also become fully
protected from damage caused by non-magical light (\eg sunburn,
snow-blindness), with the exception that it will not protect Greater
Undead from sunlight.  In addition, it allows vision in a Rank 20
Light Spell.  Only Solar Mages may learn this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9 Star]{Illumination}

\range{15 feet}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Object or area}
\begin{effects}
This spell causes a 1 inch circle on any non-living surface to radiate
light.  The intensity of light is determined by Rank: at Ranks 0--5 it
is merely a glow; at Ranks 6--10 it is equivalent to the light of a
candle; at Ranks 11--15 it is equivalent to the light of a torch; and
at 16--20 it is equivalent to that of a lantern.  Only Star Mages may
learn this spell.  It will not aid in providing bonuses for casting
purposes.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9 Shadow]{Charismatic Aura}

\range{Self}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
This spell allows the adept to use shadows advantageously to influence
reaction rolls.  The adept can choose one of three different effects
at the time of casting.  These are: to appear imposing or threatening;
to appear alluring or seductive; or to appear helpless and in need of
protection.  When used in appropriate circumstances these effects
modify reaction rolls by 5\% (+ 1 / Rank).  For example, when dealing
with an Orc Chief the first of the effects would probably be most
beneficial.  It is very difficult to perceive that the spell is in
effect.  Only Shadow Weavers may learn this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9 Dark]{Strength of Darkness}

\range{15 feet}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target's Physical Strength is increased by 1 (+ 1 for every 2 (or
fraction) Ranks) for the duration of the spell.  This spell may only
be cast by Dark Mages when they are in an area of at least 60\%
Darkness.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Reading the Night Sky}

\multiple{150}
\basechance{MA + 4\% / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may read something of the future by performing this ritual.
The ritual may only be performed from a vantage point with a clear
view of the sky (not indoors or in a hollow), and it must be a clear
night. The GM rolls for success or failure.  The GM provides the
answers writ in the stars in the form of generalised statements.  If a
successful roll occurs the statements should be generally accurate.
If a failure occurs then nothing is read.  If a backfire occurs then
the statements should be misleading.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-2]{Summoning and Binding Creatures of Light / Darkness}

\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\% + 4\% / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\begin{effects}
The adept may summon and bind 1 (+1 for every 5 or fraction Ranks)
non-sentient creature whose aspect is the same as the aspect of the
division of the college to which the Adept belongs.  Any creature
summoned must be native to the area.  If the ritual succeeds, the
creature will arrive bound to the Adept. In this state the creature
will try to protect and aid the adept to the utmost of its ability
(but it does not automatically know what the adept wishes it to do).
If the ritual backfires then the creature will arrive and immediately
attack the adept.  The creature will arrive after (20 - D10 - Rank)
minutes (minimum of 0).  Bound creatures will continue to serve the
Adept as long as passive concentration is maintained (the Adept stays
conscious and does not attempt any other spell that requires
concentration).  If the Adept is stunned, a 3 \x Willpower ( + 2 /
Rank) Willpower check is required to maintain concentration.  If the
concentration is broken the creature will immediately attack the
Adept.  The Adept may at any time release any of the creatures, in
which case the creature concerned will immediately flee from the
Adept's presence.  Creatures that may be summoned using this ritual
are those appropriately aspected, non-sentient beings from the
following categories: 66.2 Felines; 66.4 Small Land Mammals; 67.1
Common Avians; 69.1 Lizards and Kindred (except Hydras); 69.2 Snakes;
69.3 Insects and Spiders; and 72 Creatures of Night and Shadow.  Note:
Weres can only be affected by this ritual while they are in their
beast form.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Healing}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Cures 1 point of Endurance or Fatigue ( + 1 / every 2 or fraction
Ranks).  This spell will not cure specific Grievous Injuries and the
extra endurance points associated with any Grievous Injury, nor will
it ``cure'' tiredness fatigue (including that lost due to spell
casting). However, this spell can cure as if the curing was attempted
by a healer of Rank equivalent to the Rank of the spell / 5 (round
down).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Creating Light/Dark Sword}
\range{15 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cause any sword (as listed on the weapons chart) within
range to become a sword of the Adept's element (\ie light for Solar or
Star Mages, and Dark for Shadow Weavers or Dark Mages).  The sword
will then have its Strike Chance increased by 1\% (+ 1 / Rank) and its
Damage increased by 1 (+ 1 / every 3 or fraction Ranks) whenever it is
used against a creature of the opposite element (\ie dark aspected for
a Light Sword and light aspected for a Dark Sword).  Light Swords
sparkle with small white sparks, and dark swords appear blacker than
black.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Bolt of Starfire}

\range{40 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{35\%}

\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity, object or volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept casts a bolt of starfire towards any target within range.
The target may be a volume of air.  The first entity or object that
the bolt hits along its flight path suffers [D - 4] (+ 1 / Rank)
damage unless the target successfully resists.  If fired at figures in
Close Combat the bolt will hit a random target (based on their
relative sizes).

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Meteorite Shower}

\range{60 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Delayed effect}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The adept calls down from the heavens a meteorite shower which peppers
a given area that was entirely within the Adept's range at the time of
casting.  The meteorite shower is targeted to hit a specific hex and
takes 2 minutes (-10 seconds / Rank) to arrive (minimum of the end of
the following pulse).  Any entities within a vertical column that is
25 feet in diameter (centred on the target hex), with a height equal
to the spell's range) must resist or suffer [D - 4] (+1 / Rank)
damage.  The Adept may counterspell this spell at any time prior to
the meteorite shower arriving by casting the appropriate counterspell
at the targeted hex.  The targeted hex will have a magical aura until
the meteorite shower arrives (or is counterspelled by the Adept).
This spell will have no effect if it is targeted on a hex which is
already a target of this spell.  Note that a solid surface (such as
10' of earth) will prevent the meteorite shower from reaching its
target hex.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Star / Shadow Wings}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Sentient Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell receives wings comprising of the element of
the Adept (\ie Light if a Solar or Star Mage, and Dark if a Shadow
Weaver or Dark Mage).  These wings will carry the target, and anything
that the target can carry, at a speed of 30 (+1 / Rank) miles per
hour.  (NB : 1 mph approximately 1.5' / sec = 1.5 hexes / pulse.
During a take off or landing half that distance will be travelled).
The wings have a wingspan of 30' and are insubstantial.  If the wings
come in contact with an object they will cease to work until they can
once more spread unhindered (\eg 30' of open ground is usually
necessary in order to start using them).  Note that normal
precipitation (\ie rain, mist, snow and hail) will not cause the wings
to cease functioning.  The Wings will not become invisible or unseen
if the wearer does.  Star Wings are clearly visible at night and
barely visible during the day, and Shadow Wings are clearly visible
during the day and barely visible at night.  During the last 5 seconds
of the duration of the wings they will automatically try to land.
There is no earlier warning of the end of duration of the wings.  Only
sentient creatures can control the wings.

Since shadow wings are made of shadow they are clearly insubstantial
and hence can be worn in confined spaces.  However, for them to be
able to be used, they require to be properly and fully extended, that
is shaped, and will fly at full speed or not at all.  It requires 1
pulse to start and 1 pulse to stop.  They will only fly a humanoid
character and characters of human size.  That is taken to mean
characters of 3 hexes or less.  They will carry a character plus the
character's normal encumbrance.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Web of Light / Darkness}

\range{30 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration (Maximum of 15 minute + 15 / Rank)}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
A five foot wide web of the element of the Adept is projected from the
finger tips to a target hex, object or entity.  Any entities not
aspected to the element of the web, and all objects, are ensnared by
the web.  The web may only ensnare a number of entities equal to the
Adepts rank, so it will stop at the hex at which this limit is reached
(or at maximum range).  Entities ensnared in the web suffer [D - 2]
(+1 / Rank) damage (halved if they successfully resist) each pulse
that they remain in the web after the first.  The damage is done at
the end of each pulse.  Any ensnared entity must roll 1 \x Physical
Strength (2 \x if they successfully resisted) in order to move
themselves to an adjacent hex (which may be free of the web), or to
perform an action within the web.  A similar check is required for any
entity (regardless of aspect) attempting to remove an object from the
web.  If an entity receives aid in removing themselves from the web,
the PS of the aiding character may be combined with their own.  Five
or more points damage from a single blow from a B-class weapon will
destroy the entire web.  Treat the web's defence as being equal to its
Rank.  Entities of the same aspect as the element of the web may
ignore its effects, but consequently may not affect the web.  They may
aid other character in getting free of the web.  Any dropped object
will become ensnared by the web, as will any entity not aspected to
the element of the web who comes into contact with it (up to the limit
of the web).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Fear}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{15 seconds + 15 / Rank}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell is seized by uncontrollable fear and must
roll on the Fright table. At the time of casting, the Adept may choose
to modify the Fright Table roll up or down by an amount up to the rank
of the spell.  On a double or triple effect this modification may be
doubled or tripled respectively.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Increased Gravity}

\range{60 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: maximum 1 minute + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{2\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell causes a target of the Adept's choice which is within range
to suffer the effects of an increase in gravity unless they
successfully resist.  This increase in gravity subtracts 2 (+2 / Rank)
from the target's strength and 1 for every 2 Ranks (or fraction) from
the target's TMR.  The target must roll under 3 \x strength each pulse
or become immediately prone.  Once prone, a roll of 1 \x modified
strength is required in order to stand up.  If the target's strength
is reduced to less than zero, the target suffers the negative amount as
damage each pulse and must roll under Willpower + current Endurance in
order to remain conscious.  If the target and Adept become separated
by a distance greater than the range of the spell then the spell
immediately ceases to work.  If the target is under (or comes under)
the effect of a flying spell, the following applies:
\begin{Itemize}
\item If the rank of the flying spell is greater than the rank of the
Increased Gravity then the target may be able to fly.  However,
twice the rank of the Increased Gravity is subtracted from the rank
of the flying spell for purposes of determining speed and lift of the
flying spell.  This may make it a negative modifier which may reduce
the speed to 0 or less, in which case the target may not fly but may
stand.
\item If the rank of the flying spell is less than or equal to the
rank of the Increasing Gravity, then the target may not fly.  However,
half the rank of the flying spell is subtracted from the rank of the
Increased Gravity for purposes of determining the strength and TMR
reductions.
\end{Itemize}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Whitefire}
\range{30 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell must resist or be instantaneously subjected
to the heat of the interior of a star, causing death.  The target's
body is a blackened husk, their skin needs to be regenerated and their
chance of resurrection is reduced by 2\% / Rank.  If the target's
Willpower is greater than or equal to the cast chance then the target
will not be affected.  Protection from magical fire will not help
against this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10 Solar]{Solar Flare}
\range{75 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Delayed effect}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept calls down an incandescent lance of sunlight which blasts an
area of 1 hex (+ 2 hexes / 4 full ranks) in diameter.  All
non-sentient flora is immediately withered and charred.  Any entities
within the area must resist or suffer [D + 10] damage (+ 1 / 2 or
fraction ranks).  The flare takes 60 seconds (-5 / Rank) to arrive
(minimum of 5 seconds).  The flare will always arrive at the end of a
pulse and during that pulse the area will be brightly illuminated
(that is 99\% Light).  This spell may only be cast when the sun is in
the sky.  Only Solar Mages may learn this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10 Star]{Failing Star}

\duration{Delayed effect}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept calls from the sky a meteor which crashes into a given area
that was within the Adept's range at the time of casting.  The meteor
is targeted to hit a specific hex and takes 5 minutes (- 20 seconds /
Rank) to arrive (minimum of 5 seconds).  The meteor will always arrive
at the end of the pulse and will be preceded during that pulse by a
high-pitched whistle in the general area.  Any entities within the
target hex suffer [D + 12] (+ 4 / Rank) damage.  Entities within
adjacent hexes suffer [D + 2] (+ 1 / Rank) damage.  If an entity
successfully resists it suffers only half damage (round up).  The
Adept may counterspell this spell at any time prior to the meteor
arriving by casting the appropriate counterspell at the targeted hex.
The targeted hex will have a magical aura until the meteor arrives (or
is counterspelled by the Adept).  This spell will have no effect if it
is targeted on a hex which is already a target of this spell. Only
Star Mages may cast this spell.
\end{effects}

\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{350}

\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
From the Adept's fingertips erupts a column of black flames which
travel to the extent of the spell's range, and is 5 feet wide.  The
Adept may increase the width by one foot per rank.  All entities
occupying hexes through which the fire passes must resist or suffer [D
- 2] ( + 1 per Rank) damage.  Entities who are damaged by this spell
have their base chance of infection increased by 20 (+ 2 / Rank).  Any
entities wholly within the area of the fire must also roll under 1 \x
Willpower (2 \x Willpower if they successfully resisted) or suffer the
effects of a roll on the fright table.  Protection from magical fires
will not help against this spell.  Only Dark Mages may learn this
spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{effects}
The Adept may instantly teleport from within one shadow to another
shadow.  The destination must be within sight or must have been
carefully memorised beforehand.  The destination may be up to 5 miles
(+ 1 / Rank) distant.  Only Shadow Weavers may cast this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[R-1]{Conjuring and Controlling Light / Dark Sphere}

\duration{Concentration: Maximum 5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{1\%  + 3\% / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon a 12'' (+ 1'' / Rank) diameter sphere comprised
of the element of their division of the college.  Solar and Star Mages
summon a Light Sphere which is as bright as the sun and coruscates
with sparks of light.  Dark Mages and Shadow Weavers create a Dark
Sphere which is inky black and seems to suck light into it.  If the
ritual is successful the sphere will appear within 15' of the Adept
under the Adept's control.  Active concentration is required to move
the sphere, which may move at up to 6 (+ 1 / 4 full Ranks) TMR.  Once
the Adept stops concentrating, or the duration of 5 minutes (+ 5 /
Rank) is reached, the sphere will return to its own dimension.  If the
Adept fails to summon the sphere, nothing happens.  If a backfire
results (the Cast Check is more than 30 above the Cast Chance), the
sphere appears, but is not under control so will move randomly about
at maximum TMR.  Anything that comes into contact with a Dark Sphere
must resist or be immediately sucked into oblivion.  Anything that
comes into contact with a Light Sphere must resist or be immediately
reduced to a pile of ashes.  An entity that resists simply suffers D10
damage and is thrown to the ground by the shock of contact.  It is
believed that if a Light Sphere comes in contact with a Dark Sphere a
cataclysmic explosion results (however there are no known witnesses to
such an event).
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Light and Dark Aspect}
\label{celestial:aspect}
\index{aspect!light and dark}

Most creatures are either Light or Dark aspected, depending on whether they are 
nocturnal or diurnal (active during the day). There is no direct connection between 
the possession of a Light or Dark aspect and the self-styled ``Powers of Light and 
Darkness''. Entities of Light aspect are not necessarily ``good'' nor entities of Dark 
aspect ``evil''. The aspect refers only to the Entity's position with regard to the 
Elements of Light and Dark. It is also differs from an entity's astrological Aspect 
(see \S\ref{chargen:aspect}), but may be influenced by it.

To determine if an Entity is aspected with either of the elements of Light or Dark, 
follow these rules:
\begin{Itemize}
\item If the entity is a Celestial Mage then this determines their
aspect: Solar and Star Mages are Light aspected; Shadow and Dark Mages
are Dark aspected.

\item If the entity is not a Celestial Mage, and is Lunar aspected,
then they are Dark aspected. Note that Shape Changers are Lunar
aspected.

\item If the entity is not a Celestial Mage, and is Solar aspected,
they are Light aspected.

\item If none of the above applies, then an entity's race or type may
mean that they are aspected with either Light or Dark. Races or
creatures that are nocturnal, crepuscular (active at twilight) or live
predominantly underground are Dark aspected (Alusian examples:
Dwarves, Orcs, most cats, bats, wolves). Races and creatures that are
diurnal, and who do not live underground are Light aspected. Golems,
Elementals, and Beings of Mana or Spirit (or their manifestations) are
neither Light nor Dark aspected.

\begin{effects} The target of this spell is enveloped in a confusing
pattern of shadows (for Dark and Shadow) or coruscating pattern of
motes of light (Solar and Star).  Any attempt to physically hit the
target with Melee or Ranged attacks will have 2 (+ 2 / Rank)
subtracted from the Strike Chance.  In Close combat 1 (+ 1 / Rank) is
subtracted.  Any attack made without using the sense of sight (either
normal, or for that particular attack) will not be affected by this
spell (\eg a blind entity, a trample attack).  In almost all
circumstances it is quite apparent when an entity is under the effect
of this spell.  No form of magical vision will aid in avoiding the
Strike Chance reduction produced as a result of this spell.

\begin{effects} While under the effects of this spell, an adept gains
2\% (+ 2 / Rank) to the chance of resisting magical, light-based
attacks.  This includes Flash of Light, Wall of Starlight, Bolt of
Starfire, Web of Light, Solar Flare and Whitefire.  The target will
also become fully protected from damage caused by non-magical light
(\eg sunburn, snow-blindness), with the exception that it will not
protect Greater Undead from sunlight.  In addition, it allows vision
in a Rank 20 Light Spell.  Only Solar Mages may learn this spell.

\begin{effects} This spell causes a $1''$ circle on any non-living surface
to radiate light.  The intensity of light is determined by Rank: at
Ranks 0--5 it is merely a glow; at Ranks 6--10 it is equivalent to the
light of a candle; at Ranks 11--15 it is equivalent to the light of a
torch; and at 16--20 it is equivalent to that of a lantern.  Only Star
Mages may learn this spell.  It will not aid in providing bonuses for
casting purposes.

\begin{effects} This spell allows the adept to use shadows
advantageously to influence reaction rolls.  The adept can choose one
of three different effects at the time of casting.  These are: to
appear imposing or threatening; to appear alluring or seductive; or to
appear helpless and in need of protection.  When used in appropriate
circumstances these effects modify reaction rolls by 5\% (+ 1 / Rank).
For example, when dealing with an Orc Chief the first of the effects
would probably be most beneficial.  It is very difficult to perceive
that the spell is in effect.  Only Shadow Weavers may learn this spell.

Injuries and the extra endurance points associated with any Grievous
Injury, nor will it ``cure'' tiredness fatigue (including that lost due
to spell casting). However, this spell can cure as if the curing was
attempted by a healer of Rank equivalent to the Rank of the spell / 5

\begin{effects} The Adept may cause any sword (as listed on the weapons
chart) within range to become a sword of the Adept's element (\ie 
light for Solar or Star Mages, and Dark for Shadow Weavers or Dark
Mages).  The sword will then have its Strike Chance increased by 1\%
(+ 1 / Rank) and its Damage increased by 1 (+ 1 / every 3 or fraction
Ranks) whenever it is used against a creature of the opposite element
(\ie dark aspected for a Light Sword and light aspected for a Dark
Sword).  Light Swords sparkle with small white sparks, and dark swords
appear blacker than black.

within range.  The target may be a volume of air.  The first entity
or object that the bolt hits along its flight path suffers [D - 4] (+
1 / Rank) damage unless the target successfully resists.  If fired at
figures in Close Combat the bolt will hit a random target (based on
their relative sizes).

\begin{effects} The adept calls down from the heavens a meteorite
shower which peppers a given area that was entirely within the Adept's
range at the time of casting.  The meteorite shower is targeted to hit
a specific hex and takes 2 minutes (-10 seconds / Rank) to arrive
(minimum of the end of the following pulse).  Any entities within a
vertical column that is 25 feet in diameter (centred on the target
hex), with a height equal to the spell's range) must resist or suffer
[D - 4] (+1 / Rank) damage.  The Adept may counterspell this spell at
any time prior to the meteorite shower arriving by casting the
appropriate counterspell at the targeted hex.  The targeted hex will
have a magical aura until the meteorite shower arrives (or is
counterspelled by the Adept).  This spell will have no effect if it
is targeted on a hex which is already a target of this spell.  Note
that a solid surface (such as 10' of earth) will prevent the meteorite
shower from reaching its target hex.

amount up to the rank of the spell.  On a double or triple effect this
modification may be doubled or tripled respectively.

instantaneously subjected to the heat of the interior of a star,
causing death.  The target's body is a blackened husk, their skin
needs to be regenerated and their chance of resurrection is reduced by
2 per rank.  If the target's Willpower is greater than or equal to the
cast chance then the target will not be affected.  Protection from
magical fire will not help against this spell.

which blasts an area of 1 hex (+ 2 hexes / 4 full ranks) in diameter.
All non-sentient flora is immediately withered and charred.  Any
entities within the area must resist or suffer [D + 10] damage (+ 1 /
2 or fraction ranks).  The flare takes 60 seconds (-5 / Rank) to
arrive (minimum of 5 seconds).  The flare will always arrive at the
end of a pulse and during that pulse the area will be brightly
illuminated (that is 99\% Light).  This spell may only be cast when
the sun is in the sky.  Only Solar Mages may learn this spell.

\begin{effects} The Adept calls from the sky a meteor which crashes
into a given area that was within the Adept's range at the time of
casting.  The meteor is targeted to hit a specific hex and takes 5
minutes ( - 20 seconds / Rank) to arrive (minimum of 5 seconds).  The
meteor will always arrive at the end of the pulse and will be preceded
during that pulse by a high-pitched whistle in the general area.  Any
entities within the target hex suffer [D + 12] ( + 4 / Rank) damage.
Entities within adjacent hexes suffer [D + 2] ( + 1 / Rank) damage.
If an entity successfully resists it suffers only half damage (round
up).  The Adept may counterspell this spell at any time prior to the
meteor arriving by casting the appropriate counterspell at the
targeted hex.  The targeted hex will have a magical aura until the
meteor arrives (or is counterspelled by the Adept).  This spell will
have no effect if it is targeted on a hex which is already a target of
this spell. Only Star Mages may cast this spell.

flames which travel to the extent of the spell's range, and is 5 feet
wide.  The Adept may increase the width by one foot per rank.  All
entities occupying hexes through which the fire passes must resist or
suffer [D - 2] ( + 1 per Rank) damage.  Entities who are damaged by
this spell have their base chance of infection increased by 20 (+ 2 /
Rank).  Any entities wholly within the area of the fire must also
roll under 1 \x Willpower (2 \x Willpower if they successfully resisted)
or suffer the effects of a roll on the fright table.  Protection from
magical fires will not help against this spell.  Only Dark Mages may
learn this spell.

suffer [D - 2] (+1 / Rank) damage (halved if they successfully resist)

\begin{effects} This spell gives the target the ability to
automatically see normally invisible entities or objects, or those
which have been rendered invisible by magic (\eg Blending, Walking
Unseen, E \& E Invisibility, etc).  These entities or objects, when
viewed, will appear to be surrounded by a faint blue glow.  It also
gives the target the night vision of an elf, which enables the target
to see as per a human on a cloudy day up to a range of 150' outdoors
or 75' elsewhere.  This spell will not give vision to an otherwise
sightless (or blinded) entity.

If the ritual backfires (the Cast Check is more than 30 above the Cast
Chance) then the creature will arrive and immediately attack the
adept.  The creature will arrive after (20 - D10 - Rank) minutes
(minimum of 0).  Bound creatures will continue to serve the Adept as
long as passive concentration is maintained (the Adept stays conscious
and does not attempt any other spell that requires concentration).  If
the Adept is stunned, a 3 \x Willpower ( + 2 / Rank) Willpower check is
required to maintain concentration.  If the concentration is broken
the creature will immediately attack the Adept.  The Adept may at any
time release any of the creatures, in which case the creature
concerned will immediately flee from the Adept's presence.  Creatures
that may be summoned using this ritual are those appropriately
aspected, non-sentient beings from the following categories: 66.2
Felines; 66.4 Small Land Mammals; 67.1 Common Avians; 69.1 Lizards and

precipitation (\ie rain, mist, snow and hail) will not cause the

and barely visible during the day, and Shadow Wings are clearly
visible during the day and barely visible at night.  During the last 5

wings.  Only sentient creatures can control the wings.

\emph{Effect:} The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not
invisible.  If the target of the spell, or the target's possessions,
are touched by another entity, or that entity's possessions, then the
spell is broken.  An entity's possessions are those non-entity things
which the entity is wearing or carrying at that time.  An unconscious
or sleeping entity is not a possession, it is still an entity. The
target of the spell may not break it voluntarily (other than by, for
example, touching another entity). Once broken the spell must be
recast.

The target of the spell is not invisible.  This means that it will not
transmit light.  As a consequence the target will cast a shadow (which
may or may not be noticed depending on the lighting etc --- even if
noticed may not be connected to the target) and have a reflection in a
mirror (or any reflective surface).  However the target may not be
noticed even if another entity is looking directly at him/her. It
should be noted that a crystal of vision or similar would count as
looking directly at the target, not as a reflection.  An entity will
get a perception check if the target becomes invasive on that entity's
senses (\eg standing in a frontal adjacent hex, or standing behind
the entity with the target's hands over his/her eyes).  Although the
target is not invisible, it may be detected using any magical means
for detecting invisible entities (\eg witchsight).

of the college, and may only change divisions by forsaking their
present division, hence losing all of their current magical
knowledge, and undertaking at least six months training in the new
division of the College.

Creatures' fear of the power of the celestial aspect opposing their
own gives this college special power.  Hence the fright table \S
\ref{tables:frighttable} must be rolled on as a result of certain
spells.  A Magical Aptitude of 14 is required to learn the General
Knowledge of this college.  Note also that certain spells of this
college may only be learnt by specific divisions (as listed after the

Solar and Star Mages use the element of light, and Shadow Weavers and
Dark Mages use the element of darkness.  The bonuses and penalties
gained in this section apply to non-magical forms of this element.
Magical forms of the element may at best neutralise any penalties
suffered due to the natural element.
d41 2
d61 14
a74 88
\subsubsection{Solar and Dark Mages}

Solar and Dark Mages are affected by the relative presence of their
element in their vicinity.  Note that for the purposes of these
modifiers the vicinity is deemed to be any bounded area around the
adept (e.g., a room), or, if in the open, the area within 30 feet of
the adept.  Two factors need to be taken into account when attempting
to decide on the a rate modifier: the quality of the light (bright or
dim); and the extent of the light (evenly distributed or lots of
shadows).  Although there is no inherent difference between natural
and artificial light, in general artificial light is of poorer
quality.  Note that because of the purity of direct sunlight it has
special powers against certain of the Greater Undead.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{c@@{\hspace{0.5em}}cX}
{\bf Light}	&  {\bf Mod}	& {\bf Example} \\
1\%		& -25		& Inside an attic or cellar \\
5\%		& -20		& ... with a small hole \\
10\%		& -15		& Overcast night \\
25\%		& -10		& Clear moonless night \\
40\%		& -5		& Night of the full moon \\
50\%		& 0		& Twilight (dusk or dawn) \\
60\%		& 5		& Bright day in a forest \\
75\%		& 10		& Overcast day \\
90\%		& 15		& Partly cloudy day \\
95\%		& 20		& Bright sunny day \\
00\%		& 25		& Totally light, no shadows \\
\end{tabularx}

\smallskip

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{c@@{\hspace{0.5em}}cX}
{\bf Dark}	&  {\bf Mod}	& {\bf Example} \\
1\%		& -25		& Daytime in a desert \\
5\%		& -20		& Small shadows about \\
10\%		& -15		& Brightly lit interior \\
25\%		& -10		& Brightly lit underground \\
40\%		& -5		& Overcast day in a gorge \\
50\%		& 0		& Inside on an overcast day \\
60\%		& 5		& Torch-lit underground \\
75\%		& 10		& Shuttered room \\
90\%		& 15		& Windowless room \\
95\%		& 20		& Candle in total darkness \\
00\%		& 25		& Pitch-black darkness \\
\end{tabularx}

Note that the Dark examples can be applied conversely to a Solar Mage,
and vice versa.  For example, 10\% light (an overcast night), is
equivalent to 90\% dark (a windowless room).

\subsubsection{Shadow Weavers}

Shadow Weavers are affected by the shadows in their vicinity.  Note
that for the purposes of these modifiers the vicinity is deemed to be
any bounded area around the adept (e.g., a room), or, if in the open,
the area within 30 feet of the adept.  There are three cumulative
factors that must be taken into account: whether the adept is standing
within a shadow or not; how far away the edge of the shadow is from
the adept; and how well-defined the shadow is.  Each of the factors
must be included once and only once, and the second two factors must
relate to the same shadow.  The size of the shadow must be sufficient
to totally contain the adept in order to use it for these modifiers.
Neither their own shadow, nor the shadow created by anything they are
wearing can be used for these modifiers.  If no such shadow exists in
the vicinity (that is the distance is 30'+ ) then the Quality of
Contrast modifier must be ``No contrast''.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
{\bf Location}		& {\bf Mod} \\
In light		& -10 \\
Partly in shadow	& 0 \\
In shadow		& +10 \\
\end{tabularx}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
{\bf Distance From Boundary}	& {\bf Mod} \\
0' to 5'		& +5 \\
16' to 30'		& -5 \\
30' +			& -10 \\
\end{tabularx}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
{\bf Quality of Contrast}& {\bf Mod} \\
Sharp contrast		& +5 \\
Good contrast		& 0 \\
Poor contrast		& -5 \\
No contrast		&-10 \\
\end{tabularx}
d76 2
a77 37
For example, if shadow weavers stand 10' inside a cave on a sunny day,
the modification they would receive on their spells would be +15,
(+10, 0, and +5 modifiers respectively).  Moving towards the entrance
would increase their modifier to +20, and then reduce it to +10 as
they crossed and then to 0 after crossing fully into the light.  If it
was an overcast day then all of those factors would be reduced by 10
(that is -5 for a poor contrast instead of a +5 for a sharp contrast).

\subsubsection{Star Mages}

Star Mages draw their power from light within darkness.  Hence there
is an ideal amount of light which will give them their best chance at
performing their arts. More light than this and the contrast is not
great enough; less light than this and they cannot draw enough power.
Note that it is the quality of light that is important.  Star Mages
are much better off with small bright light sources in darkness, than
with just evenly spread light such as an overcast day.

At Ranks 0--5 the amount of darkness within the volume is reduced to
10\% (appears as though lit on a cloudy day), at Ranks 6--10 it is
reduced to 5\% (as though lit on a sunny day), at Ranks 11--15 it is
reduced to 1\% (similar to daytime in a desert), and at Ranks 16--20
all darkness is banished (i.e., totally light), so it is impossible to
see into or whilst within the volume (unless under the effects of a
Resistance to Light).  It will not aid in providing bonuses for
casting purposes, though it will reduces penalties due to natural
darkness by up to 5\% (+ 1\% / Rank). If the lighting conditions are
higher than that provided by the spell, no effect will be apparent.
Note that because darkness is being suppressed, no light is generated,
so any area outside the volume will not be lit. This spell can
engender silhouettes, though not create shadows. If it is not possible
to see to a lit volume, then objects within the volume are not
visible.  Any of this volume may be overridden by a higher ranked Spell
of Darkness, or neutralised (back to original conditions) by an equal
rank.

to adjust), and at Ranks 16--20 all light is banished (i.e., totally
dark).  Although infravision works off heat and elvish and dwarvish
visions work in total darkness, it is still not possible to see at all
at ranks 16--20.  It will not aid in providing bonuses for casting
purposes, though it will reduce penalties due to natural light by up
to 5\% + 1\% / Rank.  If the lighting conditions are lower than that
provided by the spell, no effect will be apparent. Note that because
light is only being suppressed, it may still pass through, and no
shadows are generated. If it is possible to see through a Darkness,
all beyond it is perfectly visible. This spell can engender
silhouettes of lit objects against the darkness, though not create
shadows.  Any of this volume may be overridden by a higher ranked
Spell of Light, or neutralised (back to original conditions) by an
equal rank.

The Adept creates a volume from which non-magical darkness is
partially or totally banished.  The volume is equal to 1000 cubic feet
(+ 500 cubic feet / Rank) and can be any shape the adept desires,
provided that no dimension is smaller than one foot.  The volume must
fall entirely within the range of the spell and, once cast, cannot be
moved.  At Ranks 0--5 the amount of darkness within the volume is
reduced to 10\% (appears as though lit on a cloudy day), at Ranks
6--10 it is reduced to 5\% (as though lit on a sunny day), at Ranks
11--15 it is reduced to 1\% (similar to daytime in a desert), and at
Ranks 16--20 all darkness is banished (i.e., totally light), so it is
impossible to see into or whilst within the volume (unless under the
effects of a Resistance to Light).  Note that because darkness is
being banished, no light is actually generated so any area outside the
volume will not be lit.  Hence this spell cannot create shadows even
though it is possible for an entity to be silhouetted against it.  If
it is not possible for an entity to see into a lit area then that
entity will not be able to see things within the lit area.  Any or all
of this volume can be overridden by a Spell of Darkness.

{\em Effects:} This talent allows the adept to communicate in a
limited fashion with non-sentient creatures.  A Solar Mage or Star
mage may communicate with those creatures who are light aspected,
whereas a Shadow Weaver or Dark Mage may communicate with those
creatures who are dark aspected.  Thee talent is limited to a range of
10' (+ 10' / Rank), and the communication is equivalent to a language
skill of 0 (+ 1 for every 5 full Ranks).  The communication is a
combination of spoken and sign language.  If either vision or sound is
not possible then the talent operates at half its actual Rank (round
down).  Moreover, if neither of these senses are available then the
talent cannot function at all.

vision similar to that of a cat.  Everything will appear monochromatic
(ie.  shades of grey) and it is difficult to accurately estimate
distance.  The higher the Rank, the less of a problem this will be.
Because the vision is monochromatic it cannot be used to do a Detect
Aura.  Note that some amount of light must be present before any sort
of vision is possible.

{\em Effects:} Once this spell is cast, the target must remain still
in order for it to have effect.  While remaining still the target is
not able to be seen by non-magical means (i.e.  as for invisibility).
If the target moves, the spell ceases to work.  However, if the target
becomes still again during the duration of the spell, it will resume
its effect.  The duration of the spell refers to the time since
casting, not the time that the spell is actually in effect (i.e. while
the target is still).

automatically cause the spell to cease working: talking, spellcasting,
triggering (subject to any revision of the Investment ritual),
readying a weapon, altering facing in a hex, moving from the hex,
using a silent language, or indeed any Action other than a Pass action
(and Pass actions being restricted as outlined).  Note that it is not
relevant if an observer would see the movement for the spell to cease
working (eg. moving hands behind back, or talking behind hand will
both cause the spell to cease having an effect).

\subsubsection{Spell of light (G-2)}

\begin{spelldesc}
{\em Range:} 15 feet + 15 / Rank \\
{\em Duration:} 15 minutes \x [D - 5] \x Rank (\x 1 if unranked) \\
{\em Experience Multiple:} 75 \\
{\em Base Chance:} 50\% \\
{\em Resist:} May not be resisted \\
{\em Storage:} Investment, Ward \\
{\em Target:} Area \\
\end{spelldesc}
{\em Effects:} The adept creates a volume from which non-magical
darkness is partially or totally banished.  The volume is equal to
1000 cubic feet (+ 500 cubic feet / Rank) and can be any shape the
adept desires, provided that no dimension is smaller than one foot.
The volume must fall entirely within the range of the spell and, once
cast, cannot be moved.  At Ranks 0--5 the amount of darkness within the
volume is reduced to 10\% (appears as though lit on a cloudy day), at
Ranks 6--10 it is reduced to 5\% (as though lit on a sunny day), at
Ranks 11--15 it is reduced to 1\% (similar to daytime in a desert), and
at Ranks 16--20 all darkness is banished (ie. totally light), so it is

it is not possible for an entity to see to a lit area then that entity
will not be able to see things within the lit area.  Any or all of
this volume can be overridden by a Spell of Darkness.

d345 19
a363 18
{\em Range:}  15 feet + 1 / Rank \\
{\em Duration:} 30 minutes + 30 / Rank \\
{\em Experience Multiple:} 150 \\
{\em Base Chance:} 10\% \\
{\em Resist:} May not be resisted. \\
{\em Storage:} Investment, Ward, Potion \\
{\em Target:} Entity \\
\end{spelldesc}
{\em Effects:} The target of this spell is enveloped in a confusing
patten of shadows.  Any attempt to physically hit the target with
Melee or Ranged attacks will have 2 (+ 2 / Rank) subtracted from the
Strike Chance.  In Close combat 1 (+ 1 / Rank) is subtracted.  Any
attack made without using the sense of sight (either normal, or for
that particular attack) will not be affected by this spell (eg.  a
blind entity, a trample attack).  In almost all circumstances it is
quite apparent when an entity is under the effect of a Shadow Form.
No form of magical vision will aid in avoiding the Strike Chance
reduction produced as a result of this spell.

flat on a large open surface). The surface or surfaces that the Wall

d398 1
a398 1
the end of the curvature).  The entire anchoring edge must be visible
d401 16
a416 11
wall will immediately dissipate.  (For example, an adept casts a wall
1' off the ground, attached to a door.  As soon as the door is opened
the wall is dissipated.  If, however, the adept had cast it so that it
overlapped the door frame, and it projected slightly above the top of
the door, then it would not have been dissipated because no entire
cross-section of the anchoring edge has been removed.  In this case
somebody with a sharp implement (and quite a bit of patience) could
scratch away at the stone wall until they had created a groove through
the entire cross-section of the Wall of Light in order to make it
dissipate). Note that this spell will not be affected by a Spell of
Darkness except to reduce its lighting effect.

The sword will then have its Strike Chance increased by 1\% (+ 1 /

whenever it is used against a creature of the opposite element (ie
dark aspected for a Light Sword and light aspected for a Dark Sword).
Light Swords sparkle with small white sparks, and dark swords appear
blacker than black.
