@\begin{college}[2.0]{fire}{Fire Magics}{FI}

\textbf{This College is a probationary College. This means that this
College is under trial for two years (as of January 2000). All
characters that join this College do so under the understanding that
if this College is deemed unplayable, it may be withdrawn or radically
changed. At that point, all such characters may have the EP and time
spent in this College refunded, to be re-spent freely in another
College as if that College had been their original choice.}

The College of Fire Magics is concerned exclusively with manipulating
the element of fire. Adepts of this College are referred to as Fire
Mages or Pyromancers.

The affinity fire mages have for their element has often led to them
being considered to be pyromaniacs. Most fire mages, however, have a
healthy respect for fire, and rarely will they wantonly set people or
places alight. They do enjoy being in or near fire and are generally
the first to suggest a nice camp fire when adventuring. Fire mages are
also thought to be hot-tempered, to enjoy hot and spicy food, and to
dislike getting wet. They frequently have red hair. Generally fire
mages are flamboyant characters, particularly in their
spell-casting. The College of Fire Magics is anything but subtle, and
its spells involve more than the usual amounts of shouting and
arm-waving.

The element of fire is unquestionably destructive, and as a
consequence the majority of the spells of this college cause
considerable amount of damage, if only as a side-effect. The Fire
College is not noted for being harmless, and so fire mages are even
less popular than most mages among the common folk. When it is
revealed that a person is an Adept of the Fire College the usual
reaction will generally be one of fear and trepidation. Fire mages are
quite amicable towards the Adepts of other colleges with the notable
exception of those of the College of Water Magics.

\subsubsection{Traditional colours}

Fire mages generally prefer to wear red, the colour of their element,
often trimmed with black, yellow or orange. For jewellery the fire
mage most frequently chooses garnets or rubies, set in gold.

\subsubsection{Traditional symbols}

The symbol of the Fire College is the flame, usually depicted in red
or gold.

\subsection{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Fire Magics may only practice their arts in
an area where it is possible for fire to exist. They may not practice
fire magic underwater or in a vacuum, for example.

The MA requirement for this college is 12.

\subsection{Modifications}

The Base Chance of performing any talent, spell or ritual of the
College of Fire Magics is modified by addition of the following
numbers:

\begin{inset}{\small}{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Adept is in light mist, fog, or rain, or is soaking wet &  -5 \\
Adept is in heavy fog, or rain, or is partially immersed in water &  -10 \\
Adept is almost totally immersed in water &  -15 \\
\end{tabularx}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Adept is within 30 feet of large campfire &  +5 \\
Adept is within 30 feet of bonfire &  +10 \\
Adept is in contact with small campfire &  +5 \\
Adept is in contact with large campfire &  +10 \\
Adept is in contact with bonfire &  +15 \\
\end{tabularx}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Adept is in a hot, dry region (\eg desert)	&  +5 \\
\end{tabularx}
\end{inset}

Only one modifier from each group may be applied together. These
bonuses only apply to normal fire. Magical fire may only be used to
reduce negative modifiers to zero.

Unless otherwise specified, Magical Fire will automatically ignite
flammables.

\subsubsection{Damage by Burning}

Occasionally a character will suffer damage from falling in to, or
being exposed to, fire. The following table indicates the pulse by
pulse damage taken by an entity being in contact with fire. While
ignition of flammables on a person will not always occur, if an entity
is immersed in fire (\eg passage through a Wall of Fire) flammable
possessions will catch alight. Unless otherwise specified, Magical
Fire will automatically ignite flammables.

If the pulse after ignition is spent putting flammables out, no
further damage occurs. In general exposure to a fire source indicates
exposure for a full pulse, therefore standing in a bonfire might hurt
a character but simply jumping through one might not. This table
should be used as a guide to how much damage exposure to a particular
fire source might cause.

\begin{inset}{\small}{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Clothing alight after passage through a fire	&  D + 3 \\
Standing in campfire &  D + 5 \\
Standing in a one Hex bonfire &  D + 10 \\
Very large bonfire, house fire &  D + 15 \\
Raging forest fire &  D + 25 \\
Immersion in boiling water &  D + 35 \\
Immersion in boiling oil &  D + 50 \\
Immersion in molten metal or lava &  D + 100 \\
Sauron's forge &  D + 150 \\
\end{tabularx}
\end{inset}

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Infravision}
\range{50 feet + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\resist{None}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to see heat sources as if they emit normal light and
target them (\eg with weapons or spells) in the absence of visible
light.  It works best in relative darkness, since it is easily
over-powered by visible light.

Within range low level heat sources (such as living bodies) can be
seen. At double range medium level sources (such as camp fires) are
visible and high level heat sources may be visible at any range.

This talent can sometimes penetrate where normal vision cannot. At
half normal range the Adept can see heat sources which are warmer than
the obscurement, eg. living entities through mist or light bushes. It
may also possible to detect the residual heat of a source which has
recently been moved or extinguished.

The Adept has a base chance of PC (+ 5 / Rank) - 1 / 10 feet between
the Adept and the heat source (after the first 10) of gaining
additional information about a particular heat source. They may:

\begin{Enumerate}
\item
Determine the relative temperature of the heat source.

\item
Identify the general type of heat source. Only those heat sources that
the Adept has previously encountered may be identified with this
talent. At higher ranks familiar individuals may identified.

\item
Determine if the heat radiated by source is being generated by magic,
\eg the Adept is able to distinguish between normal and magical
fire. (Note only fire College infravision has this ability).

The Adept may re-attempt any of these abilities after a period of 41
pulses (- 2 / Rank) has elapsed or if the Adept is 20 feet closer to
the target.
\end{Enumerate}
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Pyrogenisis}
\range{Sight}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{MA + 5 / Rank - 1 / 5 feet separating the Adept from the target (after the first 5 feet)}
\resist{Passive}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cause to burst into flame a single mass of dry,
flammable material weighing up to 1oz (+ 1/ 5 ranks). Once alight it
will burn normally and may be extinguished by either mundane or
magical means. Flammable materials are defined as wood, paper, cloth
etc, but not flesh, except that Pyrogenisis may be used to cremate
insects and small creatures within the maximum weight restrictions.
This talent cannot be used on possessions. Utilising this talent
requires a pass action, and is obvious to observers.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Bolt of Fire}
\range{25 feet + 25 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Ward, Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity, Object, Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept causes a bolt of Fire to streak from their hand towards
anywhere in range. The first entity or object the bolt hits in its
path must resist or suffer D (+ 1 / Rank) damage.  If the bolt does
not hit anything it will dissipate at the end of its range. At Rank 20
the Adept may delay releasing the bolt for a pulse if they should
choose.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Extinguish Fire Spell}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
When successfully cast, this spell will extinguish all fire in a 10
foot (+ 10 / Rank) sphere. All the volume affected must be within
range of the spell. If the range doubled or tripled the volume may
likewise be increased.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Fire Armour}
\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Object, Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell protects the target against damage by fire for 4 (+ 4 /
Rank) points of protection. Protection is ablative and when the damage
the spell may absorb is exceeded, the spell is dissapated with any
excess damage applied to the target. Double and triple effects may
apply to duration or degree of protection. At Rank 20 the spell
confers 100 points of protection.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Firelight}
\range{Touch}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object, Point}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a source of light emanating in all directions from
an object or point touched by them. At ranks 0 to 5 the light emitted
is equivalent to that of a torch, at ranks 6 to 10 that of a small
campfire, at ranks 11 to 15 a large campfire, and at ranks 16 to 20 a
bonfire. The light emitted will have the appearance of firelight of
the appropriate strength. It is magical light, and will cast poor
contrast shadows.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Fireproofing}
\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity, Object}
\begin{effects}
The spell protects the target from all non-magical fire and heat
effects up to the heat equivalent of a bonfire. An entity or object is
also protected against smoke effects (including smoke inhalation),
hypothermia and sunstroke.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Increase Temperature}
\range{Touch}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Volume, Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept must remain in contact with the target for heating
to occur.  When the spell ends the target will cool normally.
\begin{Description}
\item[Gases] Duration: 1 hour + 1 / Rank

The Adept may cause the temperature of a closed contiguous volume of
gas (such as air) to increase. The volume affected is equal to 125 (+
125 / Rank) cubic feet. The temperature can be increased by up to 2(C
per Rank. At Rank 20 the volume that can be affected by Increase
Temperature is doubled

\item[Solids] Duration: 5 minutes + 5 / Rank

The Adept may heat 1 lb (+ 1 / Rank) of solid material up to 50 (+ 50
/ Rank) degrees C. The Adept may choose any combination of temperature
increase increment and mass increment to a total of the Adept's
rank. The temperature increase takes 10 seconds / 100 degrees / pound
mass. At Rank 20 any metal item within the weight limit of the Adept
can be reduced to molten slag in as little as 10 seconds (resistance
roll is applicable).

\item[Liquids] Duration: 5 minutes + 5 / Rank

The Adept may heat 1 (+ 1 / Rank) pints of liquid up to 20 (+ 20 /
Rank) degrees C. They may choose any combination of temperature
increase increment and mass increment to a total of the Adept's
rank. The temperature increase takes 10 seconds / 10 degrees /
pint. The volume of material that may be affected is increased by 6
times at Rank 20.
\end{Description}
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Slow Fire}
\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell increases the duration that a wood, lamp or oil fire will
burn for by 1 (+ 1 / Rank) hours. Light remains constant while the
spell is in effect but heat from the fire source is halved. This spell
may be used to slow the effects of small fires or to ensure a fire
lasts for a considerable period of time.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Smoke Creation}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may create a volume of smoke equal to 1000 cubic feet (+ 500
/ Rank). This volume must be closed and contiguous, and has a minimum
thickness of 5 feet. The density of the smoke may vary from light
vapours at Rank 0 to thick, roiling smoke at Rank 20. The Adept may
choose the density of the smoke when casting. The smoke produced
reduces visual perception by 1 multiplier per 5 full ranks (but may
not reduce it to less than once times perception). The effective Rank
of the spell will be decreased by 1 Rank per 10 miles/hour of wind
(minimum Rank 0) in the target volume. Below rank 10 the smoke created
by this spell is completely transparent to infravision.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Binding Fire}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{None}
\target{Fire}
\material{Fire source + Endurance (optional)}
\actions{Chanting and dancing}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
The Adept gains complete control over a fire source as large as 10 (+
10 / Rank) cubic feet. This fire may then be moulded and shaped as
desired but with a minimum of one foot thickness in any dimension.
Regardless of the shape created, the fire retains its normal heat and
damaging properties. Damage is as per a large bonfire or [D - 3] if
the entity is within one hex. Bound fire is unaffected by normal rains
and winds short of hurricane conditions, but may be extinguished by a
dousing of water of similar or greater volume than the fire.

If the Adept sacrifices 2 points of Endurance from a sentient as part
of the ritual, the duration of the Ritual of Binding Fire is enhanced
to 1 year (+ 1 / Rank).

If the Adept sacrifices 4 points of Endurance from a sentient creature
the duration of the Ritual of Binding Fire is permanent. This Fire is
bound to a specific non-movable item from which the fire appears to
issue (\eg a ruby set in a wall, a line of runes on a floor etc).
Permanent Bound Fire can be suppressed for [21 - Rank] minutes by a
dousing of water of similar or greater volume than the fire, attack
with magical cold for more damage than the damage rating of the fire
etc. To disippate a permanent Bound Fire the object to which it is
bound must be broken, destroyed or seriously defaced.

The Adept may instil basic intelligence in a Bound Fire if desired and
give the entity thus created simple commands.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Cleansing Flame Spell}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank above 10}
\duration{125 seconds - 5 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Potion, Ward, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target is wreathed in yellowy green flames causing hideous
suffering, yet curing the target of the effects of natural poisons
(acts as Rank / 2 vs synthetic poison), venoms, fevers and diseases. As
the foulness is burnt away, the flames change colour until they become
silvery white. While cleansing takes place any ongoing harm is
halted. At the end of the duration, the target is cured and their
possessions are cleaned to a high polish. During the cleansing all the
target's Strike Chances, Defence and Cast Chances are reduced by 25
(-1 / Rank). This spell only affects willing targets. At Rank 20 this
spell also cures the effects of Malignant Flames. This spell can also
be used to cure burns, including third degree burns but scaring from
burns are not affected.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Dragon Flames}
\range{Special}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may breath magical fire like a Dragon causing D10 (+ 3 /
Rank) damage to entities within the area of effect. The area of effect
is a cone issuing from the Adepts mouth and is 20 feet (+ 5 / Rank)
long, and 5 (+ 5 / 3 Ranks) wide at end farthest from the Adept. If an
entity resists the damage is halved, unless they are more than half
immersed in water (eg. swimming) where they take no damage. Dragon
Flames are analogous to an instantaneous flash of heat, but there are
no over-pressure or explosive effects.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Fire Arc}
\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may transform 1 entity (+ 1 / 3 or fraction Ranks) into a
bolt of fire that flashes to any unobstructed point in line of sight
up to 25 (+ 25 / Rank) feet away. The bolt must land within 5 feet of
a potentially flammable substance, an entity or a solid surface. When
the bolt arrives, it bursts into flame causing D10 damage to all
entities within 1 hex. At Rank 20 the target may instantaneously
return to the point of origin of the spell at the end of the next
pulse should they so desire. Double and triple effects apply to range
only. This spell affects only willing targets and will not work
underwater. Any barriers, wards etc that are passed over affect the
targets as if crossed normally.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Fireball}
\range{60 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{550}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept conjures a ball of fire 1 foot in diameter which rushes to a
point in line of sight of the Adept, and explodes in a radius of 5
foot (+ 5 / 5 or fraction Ranks). Every thing in this radius must
resist or suffer D10 (+ 1 / Rank) damage. If an entity resists the
damage is halved, unless they are more than half immersed in water
(\eg swimming) where they take no damage. The spell may set flammable
items afire when it bursts. Hard cover (\eg walls, parapets, but not
shields) reduces damage to half before resistance. In some instances,
\eg a character wading through water, resistance may negate all
damage. The fireball is analogous to an instantaneous flash of heat
and are no over-pressure or explosive effects. A fireball may be
detonated prematurely by the imposition of barriers in its line of
flight.

At Rank 20 this spell may be cast with a detonation delay of up to 10
pulses. This extends the casting time 4 pulses. A delayed blast
fireball manifests itself as a 1 foot wide floating sphere of fire
until detonation occurs. If a second fireball is cast within the
proposed volume of effect of the first, both are detonated.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Heat Shield}
\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Object, Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell protects the target against damage by cold or ice for 4 (+
4 / Rank) points of protection.  Protection is ablative and when the
damage the spell may absorb is exceeded, the spell is dissapated with
any excess damage applied to the target. Double and triple effects may
apply to duration or degree of protection.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Hellfire}
\range{10 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{650}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This sulphurous fire attacks 1 target for every 3 (or fraction)
Ranks. The target's Magical Resistance is reduced by 5 (+ 1 / Rank).
The spell does D10 (+ 2 / Rank) damage to each target. If a target
successfully resists, they suffer only half damage (round up).  Double
damage add an additional 1 / Rank damage and triple damage adds an
additional 2 / Rank damage.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Immolation}
\range{Self}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept gains the grace and form of a dancing flame, without in
anyway altering their physical nature, but increasing their defence by
2 (+ 3 / 2 Ranks). Any entity that is within 5 feet must resist or
take 1 / 2 (or fraction) Ranks Fire damage per pulse. The target will
glow with the same degree of brightness as a Firelight spell 5 Ranks
lower, (minimum 1). The target appears to be a humanoid shape composed
of flame. If the target hides in a fire, the target may only be
detected by witchsight or by infravision..
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Malignant Flames}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{550}
\basechance{5\%}

This spell may be mistaken for a Fireball. The Adept conjures a ball
of fire 1 foot in diameter which rushes to a point in line of sight of
the Adept, and bursts in a radius of 5 foot (+ 5 / 5 or fraction
Ranks) with an enormous flash of light and fireworks. Any entity in
this radius who can see must resist or they are dazzled by the flash
for [D - 5] (+ 1 / 3 or fraction Ranks) pulses.  Dazzled entities have
their strike chances, cast chances and perception checks reduced by 1

increased by 1 (+ 1 / Rank), damage increased by + 1 / 2 (or fraction)
Ranks. When the weapon is used against a entity which are creatures of
cold or water or against the Undead, damage increases to 1 / Rank. A
missile may also be the target (\eg arrow), but not missile weapons.
At rank 11 any hand-held weapon may be created from fire. This weapon

wall of flames, or a 5 foot high \x 1 foot thick circle of flames with
a 5 foot radius, or a pillar fire 15 feet high with a 2 foot radius.
The Adept can increase any single dimension by 1 foot / Rank. The wall
must be anchored to a surface and cannot easily be seen through. Any
object or entity that passes through the wall must resist or suffer
D10 ( + 1 / Rank) damage. If an entity resists the damage is halved.
The wall will provide light equivalent to a large campfire. At Rank 20
the Adept may double the damage of a Wall of Fire by halving its

\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell imbues an entity with the speed and essence of a forest
fire. The target may run without tiring at a speed of 20 (+ 2 / Rank)
miles per hour over any solid surface.  Additionally they may ``run''
across any substance that would ordinarily support fire (\eg across
tree tops, up a wooden wall, or across oil). Like a fire, momentum
effects do not apply to the target: they may take corners at
impossible angles, climb a flammable surface impossibly quickly, or
stop instantly in place. The target may leap a gap (as a fire leaps a
firebreak) a horizontal distance of PS (+ 1 / Rank) feet or a vertical
distance of 1/2 PS (+ 1 / Rank) feet. The target will leave charred
footprints behind them but will not normally ignite surfaces they
cross.

An entity under Wildfires is moving too quickly to undertake normal
tactical combat or to otherwise interact with other entities. If they
wish to engage in melee they must dissipate the spell.

The target must keep moving at least two hexes in any direction per
pulse.  If they stop the spell is disippated. When the spell ends the
target stops instantly in place.

At Rank 20 the target may extend the duration of the spell by
suffering 1 EN damage / 10 additional minutes.

This ritual increases temperature in the target area by 2C per Rank,
slowly building up at 2 degrees C per hour. This may impede rainfall,
kills plants, dry up wells, ponds, etc and ruin crops if repeated
regularly. In cold or icy areas climes it may make an area tolerable

The Adept must sit next to a fire and stare into the flames
for half an hour.  They may then attempt one of three visions:

\begin{Itemize}
\item
A view as if the Adept was looking out of a fire within 1/2 a mile (+
1/4 mile Rank). The Adept may choose to look out of a specific fire,
otherwise the fire is randomly determined from all those in range. If
no fires are within range the Adept will see nothing. They may move
their viewpoint within the fire so as to see in any direction. There
is no way to perceive that a fire is looked through by this ritual.

\item
A precognitive vision which is controlled by the GM. The detail of
this vision and the amount of information obtained increases with
rank.

\item
If the Adept chooses to sacrifice an object (which is destroyed) in
the fire, they gain a vision relevant to that object's past. This
version of the ritual can only be performed on flammable objects.

dislike getting wet. They frequently have red hair, though there
appears to be no hereditary basis for this. Generally fire mages are
flamboyant characters, particularly in their spell-casting. The
College of Fire Magics is anything but subtle, and its spells involve
more than the usual amounts of shouting and arm-waving.
d30 6

College is not noted for being environmentally friendly, and so fire
mages are even less popular than most mages among the common
folk. When it is revealed that a person is an Adept of the Fire
College the usual reaction will generally be 1 of fear and
trepidation. Fire mages are quite amicable towards the Adepts of other
colleges with the notable exception of those of the College of Water
Magics.

Occasionally a character will suffer damage from fire, by ether
falling in to it, or being exposed to it. The following table
indicates the pulse by pulse damage taken by a character standing in
fire or by having their clothing etc, catching alight in the pulse
after exposure to a Fireball, Dragon Flames or passage through a Wall
of Fire etc.  While ignition of flammables on a person will not always
occur, spells that are immersive in nature \eg passage through a Wall
of Fire, or where a character deliberately stands in a fire, will
always result in ignition of flammable material.  If the pulse after
ignition is spent putting flammables out, no further damage occurs. In
general exposure to a fire source indicates exposure for a full pulse,
therefore standing in a bonfire might hurt a character but simply
jumping through one might not. The table below should be used as a
guide to how much damage exposure to a particular fire source might
cause.

The Adept is able to see heat sources as if they emitted normal
light. This works best in relative darkness, since it is easily
over-powered by visible light. Infravision can be used to target
weapons and spells. As a result of this talent the Adept can see in
the absence of visible light. Low level heat sources such as living
bodies give this talent a normal working range of 50 feet + 5 / Rank
to this talent. Medium level high sources such as campfires are
visible at twice this distance (note that the plume of hot air from a
fire will extend to a considerable height). High level heat sources
may be visible at any range. This talent can sometimes penetrate where
normal vision cannot.  For example, the Adept can see heat sources
through smoke and mist as long as the obscurement is not warmer than
the thing being viewed (at a 50\% reduction in range). The Adept can
perceive living entities attempting to hide in light cover (such as
bushes). It is also possible to detect the residual heat of a source,
which has recently been moved or extinguished. Should the Adept wish
to concentrate on a particular heat source, a check against a base
chance of perception + 5 / Rank - 1 / 10 feet separating the Adept
from the heat source (after the first 10 feet). If this is successful
the Adept can:

the Adept has previously encountered and as a consequence knows the
heat signature of may be identified with this talent. At higher ranks
familiar individuals may identified.  Determine the relative
temperature of the heat source.  Determine if the heat radiated by any
object or entity perceived by this talent is being generated by
magic. Thus the Adept may employ this talent to distinguish between
normal and magical fire. Only fire mage infravision has this
capability.

Should the talent fail it may be re-attempted after either the Adept
or target has moved so that the Adept is at least 20 feet closer to
the target, or after a period of 41 pulses - 2 / Rank has elapsed.

The Adept may cause a single mass of dry, flammable material to burst
into flame. This amount is equal to 1 oz + 1 oz for every 5 ranks the
Adept has attained in the talent. Thereafter it will burn normally and
may be extinguished by either mundane or magical means. Flammable
materials are to be defined as wood, paper, cloth etc, but not flesh,
with the exception that Pyrogenisis may be used to cremate insects and
small invertebrates \eg slugs, snails etc within the mass restrictions
detailed above. If the talent is used on another's possession this
talent will automatically fail. Utilizing this talent requires a pass
action, and it has an obvious somatic component. Should it fail the

The Adept may create a volume of smoke equal to 1000 (+500 / Rank)

minimum thickness of 5 feet. The density of the smoke may vary from
light vapors at Rank 0 to thick, roiling smoke at Rank 20. The Adept
at casting may vary the density of the smoke. The smoke produced
reduces visual perception by 1 level per 5 full ranks (but may not
reduce it to less than once times perception). Thus at Rank 10 a 4 \x
perception check reduces to 2 \x perception check. The effective Rank
of the spell will be decreased by 1 Rank per 10 miles/hour of wind, to
a minimum of Rank 0, if cast out of doors or in a space where wind is
present.  Below rank 10 the smoke created by this spell is completely

If the ritual is successful the Adept gains complete control over a
fire source as large as 10 (+ 10 / Rank) cubic feet.  This fire may
then be moulded and shaped as desired but with a minimum of one foot
thickness in any dimension. Regardless of the shape created, the fire
retains its normal heat and damaging properties. Damage is as per a
large bonfire or [D - 3] if the entity is within one hex. Bound fire
is unaffected by normal rains and winds short of hurricane conditions,
but may be extinguished by a dousing of water of similar or greater
volume than the fire. If the Adept sacrifices 2 points of Endurance
from a sentient as part of the ritual, the duration of the Ritual of
Binding Fire is enhanced to 1 (+ 1 / Rank) years.  While expensive, a
Ritual of Binding Fire may be made permanent. This may only be
accomplished by the sacrifice of at least 4 points of Endurance from a
sentient creature. In these cases the Fire is bound to a specific
nonmovable item from which the fire appears to issue \eg a ruby set in
a wall, a line of runes on a floor etc. For a permanent Bound Fire to
be negated, the object to which it is bound must be broken, destroyed
or defaced. Any other successful damage to a permanent Bound Fire
simply suppresses the Fire for Rank minutes \eg dousing with the
required volume of water, attack with Ray of Cold for more damage than
the damage rating of the Bound Fire etc.

The Adept may instil intelligence in a Bound Fire if desired and give
the entity thus created simple commands.  Examples ``Protect me'' or
``only allow those to pass who say zebus'' etc.

hex. The Adept may effect 1 + 1 creatures for every 3 full ranks or
fractions there of.  At Rank 20 the Adept may instantaneously return
to the point of origin of the spell at the end of the next pulse
should they so desire. Double and triple effects can be applied to
range only. This spell affects only willing targets and will not work

The spell conjures a ball of fire 1 foot in diameter which rushes to
the point selected by the Adept, exploding in a radius of 5 (+ 5 every
5 or fraction Ranks) feet. Damage is D10 (+ 1 / Rank), with the target
taking half if they sucessfully resist.  The spell may set flammable
items alight when it bursts. Hard cover (\eg walls, parapets,
mantelets but not shields) reduces damage to 1/2 before resistance is
rolled. There are no over-pressure or explosive effects --- the
fireball is analogous to an instantaneous flash of heat. A fireball
may be detonated prematurely by the imposition of barriers in its line
of flight and it may only be aimed at a point that the Adept can see
and which is in range. At Rank 20 this spell may be cast with a
detonation delay of up to 10 pulses. If this option is chosen then
casting time is extended to 4 pulses as the mage must include the
``delay'' factor in his casting. A delayed blast fireball manifests
itself as a 1 foot diameter floating sphere of fire until detonation
occurs. If a second fireball is cast within the proposed volume of
effect of the first, both are detonated.

Note: There are some instances where resisting the spell will negate
all damage.  For example, the target is wading through deep water.

only be detected by Witchsight, Wizardsight or by infravision.
Otherwise the target appears to be a humanoid shape composed of flame.
d564 6
a569 11
A target of the Adept 's choice is swathed in flames that are only
visible to the victim. The flames do D10 (+ 2 / Rank) damage.  If the
target resists they suffer half damage.  In addition the target is
subject to other damage if the spell is at rank 5 or higher. In this
case, a number of points equal to [D - 4] + (1 / 5 full Ranks) are
removed from 1 characteristic or statistic of the victim. The victim
will regain these points after (4 + Rank) days or after a remove curse
ritual is performed over the victim. The Adept may determine the
characteristic to be affected. A characteristic may not be reduced
below 1 as a result of this spell. At Rank 20 a victim may be affected
for (4 + Rank) days.

This spell may be mistaken for a Fireball. A small 1 foot globe of
Fire streaks to the target, then bursts with an enormous flash of
light, smoke and fireworks. All those in the area of effect who see
the explosion must resist or be are dazzled and left blinking by the
flash for [D - 5] (+ 1 / 3 or fraction Ranks) pulses.  Dazzled
entities have their strike chances reduced by 1 (+ 2 / Rank) of the
Adept. Perception and casting checks are reduced by the same amount.
The volume affected by the spell is a radius centred on a hex of 5 (+
5 / 3 or fraction Ranks) feet. Creatures without normal vision, \eg
the undead, are unaffected by Pyrotechnics. Double and triple effects
may be applied to range only.  The Adept can always cast a smaller
radius effect if desired to a minium of 5 feet.
d619 5
a623 7
The Adept may summon a salamander, which will then attempt to set
afire anything flammable that it can reach.  The Summoner will have no
control over the salamander. Casting a Special Knowledge Counterspell
is the only way to dispel the salamander. The summoning of a
Salamander may only occur in the presence of a large fire source or in
environmental conditions conducive to the survival of the entity \eg
near a bonfire, volcano, in a desert.

The spell is cast over a weapon of the Adept's choice causing it to
burst into flame but without causing damage to the weapon or its
wielder. The Strike Chance to hit a target with the weapon is
increased by 1 (+ 1 / Rank), and damage is increased by 1 / 2 Ranks of
the Adept. When the weapon is used against a creature of cold or water
or against the Undead, damage increases to 1 / Rank. All creatures
that live in cold environments or in water are considered creatures of
cold or water. At rank 11 any hand-held weapon may be created from
fire. Such weapons have little actual weight, but strength and
dexterity requirements must be met as per normal. Missiles may also be
affected by this spell, but not missile weapons, thus an arrow may be
enflamed but not a bow.

a 5 foot radius, or a pillar 15 feet high with a 2 foot radius. The
Adept can increase any 1 dimension by 1 foot per Rank. The wall cannot
easily be seen through, and must be anchored to a surface. Any object
or entity that passes through the wall must resist or suffer [D +
Rank] damage (resist for half). The wall will provide light equivalent
to a Firelight spell or a large campfire. At Rank 20 the Adept may
double the damage of a Wall of Fire by halving its duration.
d674 1
d678 23
a700 26
This spell imbues a character with the speed and essence of a forest
fire. The character may run without tiring at a speed of 20 (+ 2 /
Rank) miles per hour over any solid surface. Additionally a character
may ``run'' across any substance that would ordinarily support a fire
\eg a character under the effect of a Wildfires spell could run across
tree tops, up a wooden gate or palisade or across oil spread over
water. Like a fire, momentum effects do not apply to a character under
Wildfires, they may take corners at impossible angles, climb any
flammable surface \eg a tree, impossibly quickly, or stop instantly in
place. A character under Wildfires may leap such as a fire leaps a
firebreak. This distance is equal to 1 \x PS + 1 foot per rank of
horizontal distance or 1/2 PS + 1 foot per rank vertically. This spell
may be ended at any time prior to expiry and on expiry the character
stops instantly in place, much like a fire at the end of a burn. Prior
to this a character must continue to move at the designated speed for
at least two hexes of forward or lateral motion per pulse. At Rank 20
a character under Wildfires may continue to run beyond the normal
duration of the spell by suffering 1 point of Endurance damage for
each additional 10 minutes that they run. This spell leaves charred
footprints behind the user but these will only ignite substances
coated in oil or similarly materials, not ordinary wood. This spell
may be actively resisted. Double and triple effects may only be
applied to duration. A character under Wildfires is moving too quickly
to undertake normal tactical combat or to otherwise interact with
other characters. If they wish to engage in melee they must end the
duration of the spell.

This ritual increases temperature in the target area by 2 degrees C

rainfall, kills plants, dry up wells, ponds, and ruin crops if
repeated regularly. In cold or icy areas climes it may make an area
tolerable for life for a time or result in standing fogs if the

A view as if the Adept was looking out of any fire within 1/2 a mile

fire the Adept looks out of is randomly determined, unless the Adept
knows of a specific fire (within range) and chooses to look out of
this particular fire. Should no fires exist within range, the Adept
will see nothing. The Adept cannot be perceived by anyone looking into
the fire, and may move their viewpoint within the fire so as to see in
all directions.

Summons a Lesser Efreeti to act as a stead for a Fire Adept. The
Lesser Efreeti begins as a single hex mount with a base Endurance,
Strength and Fatigue of 30. These characteristics increase at a rate
of 2 points of Strength and Fatigue for every Rank of the Adept, and 1
Point of Endurance per Rank. The exception to this is at Rank 20 at
which point the Lesser Efreeti has an Endurance of 60, Strength and
Fatigue of 80. The size of the Lesser Efreeti likewise increases. It
begins as a one hex monster, increases to 2 hexes at Rank 12, and 3
hexes at Rank 20.

Damage from an Lesser Efreeti comes from two sources, the fire from
which it is composed and from its physical attacks. The entity has
three attacks, two claws and a bite. These increase in power as
follows:
d783 6
a788 8
\begin{tabular}{lr}
Rank 0: & D + 4 \\
Rank 4: & D + 6 \\

Rank 20: &D + 16 \\
\end{tabular}
d791 40
a830 34
The Lesser Efreeti has a 65\% chance of igniting in battle and damage
is D10 (+ 1 / 2 Rank), resist for 1/2. This extends in a 5 feet radius
from the creature. This fire does not affect the Adept, nor does it
effect a person for whom a Lesser Efreeti is summoned (which is only
possible at Rank 20).

The hide of the Lesser Efreeti also increases in toughness with the
rank of the Adept. It begins at an equivalent of 1/4 of the Adept's
Willpower and increases by 1 point for every 3 ranks of the Adept's
ritual. At Rank 20 the armour becomes equivalent to 1/4 the Adept's
Willpower + 8.

The willpower, magic resistance and all other faculties of the
creature are those of its Adept.  Prior to Rank 14, a Lesser Efreeti
will follow orders that remove it from the presence of the Adept only
if these are passive in nature (e.g. wait for me here, return to this
spot at this time, fly from this point to another. Prior to this it
cannot be given orders to attack or retrieve a particular entity or
thing unless the rider is atop the creature.

The creature moves in tactical combat at a TMR of 5 (+ 1 / 4 Ranks of
the Adept's ritual) when grounded, or 8 (+ 1 / 3 ranks of the Adept's
ritual) while in the air. Long distance movement is at a rate of 20 (+
2 / Rank) miles per hour. The duration of a summoned Lesser Efreeti at
Rank 20 is 24 hours.  Double and triple effects can be applied to
duration only.

A Lesser Efreeti ignores fire attacks, but its rider suffers damage as
normal. Ice and water attacks against the creature do twice the damage
and resistance to these attacks is at -10\%. The Lesser Efreeti has a
defence rating equal to the Willpower of its Adept + 1/2 the Adept's
\% chance of the ritual. The ritual may be invested, but at a cost of
50,000 silver pieces per charge. A Lesser Efreeti cannot be banished
while the Adept is atop his stead.

The Adept summons a Fire Elemental with a combined endurance and
fatigue of 15 (+ 5 / Rank), within a fire, which must be constructed
within 20 feet of the Adept. If the ritual check is less than or equal
to the Adept's base chance, then the elemental is summoned and under
the Adept's control. If the result is 30 or more than the Adept's base
chance the ritual backfires, and the elemental arrives uncontrolled.
Any other result has no effect. The elemental strongly resents being
brought from the plane of elemental fire and therefore hates the Adept
and will immediately try to kill the Adept unless it is brought under
control. Once controlled, the elemental remains controlled until the
Adept's concentration is broken, it is banished, or the Adept returns
it to its own dimension with a special knowledge Counterspell.

The Adept may create a volume of smoke equal to 1000 cubic feet +
500/Rank. This volume must be closed and contiguous, and has a minimum
thickness of 5 feet. The density of the smoke may vary from light
vapors at Rank 0 to thick, roiling smoke at Rank 20. The Adept at
casting may vary the density of the smoke. The smoke produced reduces
visual perception by 1 level per 5 full ranks (but may not reduce it
to less than once times perception). Thus at Rank 10 a 4 x perception
check reduces to 2 x perception check. The effective Rank of the spell
will be decreased by 1 Rank per 10 miles/hour of wind, to a minimum of
Rank 0, if cast out of doors or in a space where wind is present.

The Adept creates a source of light which emanates in all directions
from a point on a object nominated by the Adept within the spell's
range. At ranks 0--5 the light emitted is equivalent to that of a
torch, at ranks 6--10 that of a small campfire, at ranks 11--15 a
large campfire, and at ranks 16--20 a bonfire.  The light emitted will
have the appearance of firelight of the appropriate strength. It is
magical light, and will cast poor contrast shadows.

The target is protected against all magical forms of fire, or against
fire spells according to the rank of the spell.  If cast on the Adept,
the effective rank of the damaging fire is reduced by the Rank of this
spell, to a minimum of no effect.  If cast on another target, the
effective rank of the damaging fire spell is reduced by half the Rank
of this spell, to a minimum of Rank 0.  If a damaging effect is not
caused by a spell or ritual its effective Rank is held to be equal to
the ``plus'' to the damage die.

\begin{example}
If a dragon's breath does [D + 25] damage, then it is said to have an
effective Rank of 25, so a Rank 12 Protection from Magical Fire will
reduce the damage to [D + 13].

d388 21
a408 8
The Adept can bind the element of fire to their will by performing a
Ritual of Binding fire in an area where fire already exists.  The
ritual requires that the Adept spend one hour of time. If the Ritual
Check is less than or equal to 9\% (+ 5 / Rank), the ritual is
successful and the fire source over which the ritual was cast is
considered bound for a length of time equal to the ability of the
adept to retain concentration over it (maximum of 1 hour + 1
additional hour per Rank).
d410 3
a412 18
The chance that the ritual will be successful is modified by the
following numbers:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{X@@{\hspace{0.5em}}r}
For every 5 feet separating the Adept from the fire being bound & -4\% \\
\end{tabularx}

A bound fire can be shaped by the Adept who bound it into any desired
form.  Its size may be increased to a size which is greater than its
original size by a factor equal to the square of the Adept's rank.
The Adept can instill in the fire intelligence equal to the their own.
The higher the Adept's Rank with the ritual, the greater the results
of the ritual.  Whereas at Rank 1, the Adept could create a Fire
Creature which would have to be guided at every turn, at Rank 10, the
same Fire Creature might be endowed with free will, but would be loyal
to the purposes of the Adept.  The ritual cannot be resisted except by
an intelligent being composed of fire (and then only passive
resistance is possible).

\target{Area}
d427 13
a439 29
The Adept can create a 5 foot high \x 20 foot long \x 1 foot
thick wall of flames, or a 5 foot high \x 1 foot thick circle of
flames with a 5 foot radius, or a pillar 15 feet high with a 2 foot
radius.  The Adept can increase any one dimension by 1 foot per Rank.
The wall cannot be seen through, and cannot be cast so as to be in
contact with any entity.  Any entity coming into contact with the wall
must resist or suffer [D - 5] (+ 1 / Rank) Fire damage.  The wall
will provide light equivalent to a Firelight spell large campfire.

The entirety of one edge must be affixed to a surface.  This means
that a wall can be created with a smaller dimension than would
otherwise be possible.  For example, casting a wall of fire on a
stepping stone that is 3' square will result in a wall which is only
3' long.  Any edge may be affixed but, for the purposes of this spell,
this does not include either face.  (For example, a wall could not be
placed flat on a large open surface). The surface or surfaces that the
Wall of fire is affixed to do not need to be flat, but the length of
the wall is measured from the deepest depression on the surface that
the wall fills.  (For example, a circularly concave wall of 5' radius,
with a rank 0 wall affixed to it will end in a flit edge 15' beyond
the end of the curvature).  The entire anchoring edge must be visible
to the Adept.  The wall itself cannot be moved.  Should an entire
cross-section of the last remaining anchoring edge be removed then the
wall will immediately dissipate.  (For example, an adept casts a wall
1' off the ground, attached to a door.  As soon as the door is opened
the wall is dissipated.  If, however, the adept had cast it so that it
overlapped the door frame, and it projected slightly above the top of
the door, then it would not have been dissipated because no entire
cross-section of the anchoring edge has been removed.

A bolt of fire emanates from the Adept's fingers which travels in the
desired direction to the extent of the spell's range.  The bolt will
always travel its full range unless it hits a target.  It will always
impact on the first target reached.  If there is no target the bolt
will dissipate at the end of its range. Unless the target successfully
resists they will suffer [D - 5] (+ 1 / Rank) damage from the bolt.
The target's resistance is reduced by 10.  If the target fails to
resist and is flammable or is wearing flammable clothing, then the
flammable possessions of the target will ignite.

This spell affects a spherical volume with a 12 foot radius.  The
entirety of the affected volume must be within the Adept's spell
range for the spell to be effective.  Any targets within the blast
zone that do not successfully resist suffer [D - 4] (+ 1 / 2, or
fraction, Ranks) damage.  There will be an overflow effect if cast in
a volume less than the size of the ball.

\begin{effects}
The Adept projects a flaming web, similar to a spider web in
construction, from their fingertips at a target hex, object or entity.
Any objects or entities standing between the Adept and the target are
ensnared by the web along with the target.  The web may only ensnare a
number of entities equal to the Adept's rank and so will stop at the
hex at which this limit is reached (or maximum range).  Entities
ensnared in the web suffer [D - 2] (+ 1 per Rank) damage (halved if
they successfully resist) each pulse that they remain in the web after
the first.  The damage is done at the end of each pulse.  The web
continues to burn until cut or until the Adept ceases to concentrate
on it.  In order to cut the web, a character must successfully strike
with a weapon that does B class damage and must inflict at least web's
Rank points of damage as a result of that single strike.  The web has
no defence.  Any ensnared entity must roll 1 \x Physical Strength ( \x
2 if they successfully resisted) in order to move themselves to an
adjacent hex (which may be free of the web), or to perform an action
within the web.  A similar check is required for any entity attempting
to remove an object from the web.  If an entity receives aid in
removing themselves from the web, the PS of the assisting character
may be combined with their own.  Any dropped object will become
ensnared by the web, as will any entity who comes into contact with it
(up to the limit of the web).

d544 7

The spell is cast over a weapon of the Adept's choice causing it to
burst into flame without damage to the weapon or wielder.  The Base
Chance to hit a target with the weapon is increased by 1 (+ 1 / Rank),
and the damage is increased by 1 for every 3 (or fraction) Ranks.
\emph{Note:} The increased damage is caused by magical fire.  When the
weapon is used against a creature of cold or water or against an
undead creature the damage is increased by 1 per Rank instead.  All
creatures which live in cold environments or in water are considered
creatures of cold or water.  At Rank 6, this spell may be used to
create a sword of flame without the necessity of casting it over a
sword.  At Rank 10 the Adept can create any flaming weapon of their
choice out of air using this spell.  When a weapon is created, it is
substantial and requires normal minimums for that weapon.  A created
weapon may be a thrown weapon, a quarrel, dart, etc, but may not be a
bow, crossbow, sling or blowgun.

Any target of the Adept's choice within range is immediately wrapped
in flames which are visible only to the victim.  The flames do [D - 5]

additional damage if the spell is Rank 15 or higher.  In this case a
number of points equal to [D - 3] are removed from one characteristic
stat of the victim.  The victim will regain these points after (4 +
Rank) weeks.  To determine which characteristic is affected, the
Adept's player rolls D10 and consults the list of results shown below:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Die} & \textbf{Characteristic} \\
1,2      & Physical Strength \\
3,4      & Manual Dexterity \\
5,6      & Agility \\

The corona of flame will inflict [D - 5] (+ 1 / Rank) damage upon any
entity occupying the same hex.  The target of the spell suffers [D -
4] damage unless the spell is Rank 10 or higher (total damage, not per
Pulse).  Whilst under the effects of the spell the target may rocket
through the air at the head of a 30 foot comet, with a speed of 60 (+
10 / Rank) mph under their own directional control. The target may
change the speed to either zero or maximum over the space of one
pulse, and may not hover.  Flammables may be ignited by the flames
within a 10 foot radius on landing and takeoff.  This spell does not
protect the wearer from the effects of magical fire.  In addition, if
a double or triple effect is obtained then only the speed may be
doubled or tripled.

controlled.  If the ritual backfires and the Elemental appears, but is
uncontrolled and will attack the summoner and their friends.  Any
other result has no effect.

A Fire Elemental always appears within 20 feet of the summoner.  It
has a combined Endurance and Fatigue equal to (15 + 15 / Rank) and,
unless controlled by the summoner will attack and burn until dispelled
by a Special Knowledge Counterspell of the College of Fire Magics.
Once controlled, the Fire Elemental remains controlled until the

If the Efreet does not agree to aid them voluntarily, the Adept may
still demand one service in exchange for allowing the Efreet to
depart.  This service must take the form of a defined task to be
performed in a matter of hours or days (though the service may take
place in the future at some indefinite time).  The Efreet will almost
always serve the summoner in battle against entities not associated
with the College of Fire Magic, but will never assist the summoner in
battle against a member of the College of Fire Magics.  Even demanding
that the Efreet attack a fellow Adept of the College of Fire Magics as
its obligatory service to the summoner will not cause the Efreet to
change its attitude in this regard.

The Adept may cause one small flammable object within range to
ignite.  Thereafter, the flames are fuelled by the object or entity.
They may be extinguished.  Note: This spell is meant to be used to
light matches and fry small insects.  It is not meant for use against
human-sized characters and has insufficient power to set clothing
alight.  For example, it can cause an effect similar to a mosquito
bite on humans.  The Adept's MA is modified in the same manner as any
Base Chance in spell casting. In addition to other modifiers, the Base
Chance is modified as follows:

The caster creates a source of light which cannot be moved emanating
in all directions from a point on a object nominated by the caster
within the spell's range. At ranks 0--5 the light emitted is
equivalent to that of a torch, at ranks 6--10 that of a small
campfire, at ranks 11--15 a large campfire, and at ranks 16--20 a
bonfire.  The light emitted will have the appearance of firelight of
the appropriate strength. It is magical light, and will cast poor
contrast shadows.

The spell provides protection from all magical types of fire or fire
spells according to the rank of the spell.  The effective rank of the
fire spell causing the flames or heat is reduced by the rank of this
spell.  For example, if the target is under the effect of this spell
at rank 5, a Hellfire cast at rank 12 will cause damage at an
effective rank of 7.  If the rank of the protection is greater than
the rank of the damaging spell then the target is totally protected
from all effects.
