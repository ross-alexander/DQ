@\begin{college}[1.6]{mind}{Sorceries of the Mind}{MI}

\textbf{This version of the College is probationary, and is under
trial for two years (as of September 2001).  All characters that join
this College do so under the understanding that if this version is
deemed unplayable, it may be withdrawn or radically changed.  At that
point, all such characters may revert to the previous version or have
the EP and time spent in this College refunded, to be re-spent freely
in another College as if that College had been their original choice.}

\subsection{Introduction}

The College of Sorceries of the Mind deals primarily with controlling
or influencing the minds of others. Adepts of this College are
variously known as Mind Mages, or Sorcerers. It is widely believed
that Sorcerers can peer into the darkest nooks and crannies of the
soul, and are near-universally feared.

\textbf{Traditional Colours \& Symbols:} This college has no
traditional colours or symbols as Sorcerers prefer to blend into
society.

\textbf{Restrictions:} Adepts of the College of Sorceries of the Mind
may practice their arts without restriction.

The Magical Aptitude requirement for becoming a member of this College
is 11.

\subsubsection{Modifications}

The Base Chance of performing any talent, spell or ritual of the
College of Sorceries of the Mind against a single entity target is
affected by relative Willpower:

\begin{inline}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
For each point the Adept's Willpower is above the target's Willpower	& +1 \\
For each point the Adept's Willpower is below the target's Willpower	& -2 \\
\end{tabularx}
\end{inline}

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Resist Pain}

\range{Self}
\multiple{300}
\storage{Potion}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is largely immune to pain. They cannot be tortured or
stunned by physical means. In addition, if there is a chance that
their concentration may have been broken, 5 (+ 1 / Rank) is always
added to their Concentration Check. No matter what the circumstances
the Adept will always have a chance of maintaining concentration. Like
all magic, this talent is affected by cold iron. However, for a weapon
to affect the talent, the weapon must be made of cold iron, must have
done endurance damage, and must remain in contact with the body. If
cold iron is used in the torture of a mind mage, the Adept adds their
concentration bonus to the base chance of resisting the torture
attempt.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Resist Temperature}

\range{Self}
\multiple{250}
\storage{Potion}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is immune to climatic extremes of temperature from arctic
cold to desert heat whether generated naturally or by magic. They
therefore do not suffer from exposure, frostbite, wind-chill, heat
stress, hypothermia or hyperthermia, and their fatigue loss is
unaffected by temperature. If the Adept is attacked by fire, ice, heat
or cold (whether magical or not) then the damage points are reduced by
1 + 1 per 5 full ranks.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-3]{Sense Danger}

\basechance{PC + 3 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\storage{Potion}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may sense the presence of a hazard to the Adept's life or
wellbeing. Generally this may be interpreted as a ``bad feeling''
about a person or an object, or a sense of foreboding about a
situation.  This talent operates continuously and unconsciously. The
Adept may also add 2 + 2 / Rank to the chance of detecting an ambush
(see Ranger) and to the chance of detecting a trap (see Spy/Thief).
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Control Animal}

\range{30 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Passive}
\target{Non-sentient entity}
\storage{Investment}
\begin{effects}
The Adept gains control over one non-sentient entity within
range. Control is lost if the entity leaves the range but recommences
if range is re-entered. The Adept does not receive any sensations from
the animal. If the Adept releases the animal or their concentration is
broken the animal may attack the Adept. The Adept controls the
animal's mind and therefore need not know how to make a bird fly: the
Adept commands the animal to do something and the animal knows how to
do it. The animal will comply within the spirit of the command.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Control Person}

\range{30 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{650}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Sentient Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept gains absolute control over every action of one sentient
entity within range. The Adept does not receive any sensations from
the target. The Adept does not need to know the target's language to
control them. Control is lost if the target leaves the range but
recommences if range is re-entered. They may control the physical
activities of that target, and use the target's physical skills where
known, but may not cause the target to cast spells.

The Adept may not use their own skills through the target. The target
always acts as if they were also affected by a Spell of Slowness (E\&E
S-11) unless they choose not to resist the spell, or subsequently
decide to co-operate with the Adept's commands. The spell continues in
effect until the Adept's concentration is broken or the Adept chooses
to release the target. The target is aware of the control, and
although the target is unable to do anything about it at the time,
they will remember being controlled. The Adept may force the target to
act in direct opposition to the target's own wishes. Suicidal
instructions however, grant the target another magic resistance which,
if successful, dissipates the spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Empathy}

\range{Touch until Rank 10}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell allows the Adept to feel the emotions and physical
sensations which the target of the spell is currently experiencing. It
also allows the Adept to absorb wounds from Endurance and Fatigue at a
rate of 2 points cured for every 1 which the Adept agrees to subtract
from their own Fatigue (never Endurance). The additional fatigue
subtracted by the Adept is damage fatigue, not spell fatigue. This
spell may not be used to regenerate spell or tiredness fatigue, but
only reduces/transfers damage. At Rank 10 or higher, the Adept can
cast this spell on a target who is within 15 feet (+ 15 / Rank over
10) or less from them. This spell may be cast on self, but only to
cure endurance damage. On a `Double' effect, 3 Damage Points are cured
for each point inflicted on the Adept; a `Triple' effect allows for 4
points per point inflicted on the Adept.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{ESP}

\range{30 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{30 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can sense the presence and general mood (but not the exact
nature) of all entities within range of the spell. The Adept has a
general idea of where each entity is, say to within 90 or 60 degrees,
the accuracy of which may increase with rank. ESP will detect the
presence of an entity even if that entity is mind cloaked. Spells
cannot be targeted through ESP.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Hypnotism}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell causes an entity to accept suggestions from the Adept.  The
spell may only be cast over a target with whom the caster is normally
able to communicate verbally. It can never be cast over a totally
hostile target. The target may be enabled to remember otherwise
forgotten details through appropriate questioning.

Once the target has been hypnotised, the Adept can make suggestions
which the target will readily accept unless they conflict directly
with their best interests. The target will never remember where these
suggestions came from.

The Adept may choose up to 1 (+ 1 / 5 Ranks) of the above suggestions
to be active in a post-hypnotic manner, which the target will continue
to implement for 3 (+ 3 / Rank) hours after the spell ceases. The
target will stop following all other suggestions once the spell
ceases.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Limited Precognition}

\range{Special}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{May not be resisted}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may see (unclearly) up to 1 (+ 1 / Rank) hours into their
own future and may foresee possible events.  The Adept's player should
describe a plan of action, and the GM will describe a vision based on
the consequences of those actions, which can be as literal or
metaphorical as the GM wishes. The clarity and detail of the vision
will be dependant on the Adept's rank. Should the Adept foresee their
own death, a fright check may be appropriate. This spell cannot be
recast immediately with a different plan; the Adept must wait until
they have taken some action to change their situation. This spell
works at any range.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Mind Shield}

\range{Self}
\duration{1 hour + 2 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{May not be resisted}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept cloaks their own mind so that their thoughts cannot be
detected or ``read'', \eg by Telepathy or other mind reading talents,
spells or rituals. The Adept's Resistance versus Mental Attack is
increased by 10 (+ 2 / Rank) while the spell is in effect. Mind Cloak
does not block ESP or Empathy. The Adept can cast Mind Speech as
normal, and may choose to decline Mind Speech from an external source.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Binding Will}
\range{10 feet}
\duration{1 day + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{10\% + 5\% / Rank}
\resist{Passive}
\casttime{1 hour}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may bind the will of an entity so that they become the loyal
retainer of the Adept and serve them in all things.  The target must
be in range during the ritual but may be unconscious or otherwise
restrained. The target gets an additional resistance check at the
beginning of each following day and if required to do anything
suicidal. If they successfully resist, the binding is broken and they
are free. The target is then aware that they have been under an
external influence. The Adept may never release the binding
voluntarily, and until the duration expires the binding continues,
even if the Adept dies (the target will do everything possible to get
the Adept resurrected).  If the ritual backfires, the Adept loses D10
from their Willpower in addition to any other backfire effect;
Hypnotism (G-5) cures this loss.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Disruption}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object or Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept causes an object or corporeal entity (substantial rather
than insubstantial) to pulsate, doing [D + 1] (+ 1 / Rank) points of
damage if the target fails to resist, and half damage to any target
that successfully resists. At Rank 10 or above, the target's internal
structure and surface will be partially disrupted, requiring the arts
of a healer or artisan of rank equal to (spell Rank / 3 , or Rank / 6
if the target resisted the spell) to prevent or remove the scaring
(damage can be cured normally).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Force Shield}

\range{Self}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates an invisible protection around the entire body
which increases the Defence of the Adept by 5 (+ 1 / Rank) against all
attacks at any range.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Healing}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{375}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may heal the target of 2 (+ 1 / Rank) Damage Points that
have been removed from the target's Fatigue or Endurance. Endurance
damage is healed first, wrapping to Fatigue damage. On a multiple
effect, the Damage Points restored may be multiplied.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Mental Attack}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cast this spell at any entity within range who can be
seen or whose position has been pinpointed via Telepathy. If the
target fails to resist, they fall unconscious and at Rank 15 and above
the Target loses [D - 5] from Willpower.  The Willpower loss is
recoverable via Hypnotism, Remove Minor Curse or naturally at one
point every 3 days. Repeated casts may further reduce the targets
Willpower to a minimum of 1.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Mind Speech}

\range{30 feet + 30 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{May not be resisted}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entities}
\begin{effects}
Allows the Adept to choose a Principal Target, plus up to 1 + 1 / Rank
other targets, who may then communicate mentally to each other as if
talking aloud in a group.  The entities may be targeted via the Spell
of Telepathy (at the time of casting). If an entity subsequently goes
further than 30 feet + 30 / Rank from the Principal Target, their
participation ceases until they re-enter that range. A language in
common is required for normal speech. At Rank 10 and above visual
images may be transmitted. All communication requires the same level
of concentration as for normal speech. The spell dissipates if the
Principal Target is killed.

Multiple casts are a special case. If one or more entities are part of
two or more spells, and are within range of all of their Principal
Targets, then every target of those spells may speak to each other as
if in one group. This can effectively increase the working range of
the effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Phantasm}

\range{Special}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{May not be resisted}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates an insubstantial, magical beast that must be
targeted at a particular victim which is either visible to the Adept
or located through the spell of Telepathy. The target may interpret
the beast as being a phantasm from their own worst nightmare. Lack of
imagination, however, does not offer any protection or immunity. The
Adept has no control over the shape of the creature.

The phantasm appears beside the Adept, and then travels straight
towards the target at a TMR equal to 1 + 1 / Rank, passing through
walls, air etc. When in melee range of the target the Phantasm always
does [D - 4] (+ 1 / Rank) damage each pulse, including the pulse when
it arrives at the target.

The phantasm is only substantial to, and visible to, the target and
thus can be directly affected by the target (using spells or magical
weapons). Anyone may cast a Mind College Special Counterspell over
the area currently occupied by the phantasm to dissipate it. The
phantasm is immune to all other spells and weapons.

The Phantasm's magic resistance, defence and initiative are all zero
and it always acts last in the pulse. The phantasm has a single
combined Endurance and Fatigue of 20 (+ 5 / 3 Ranks).

The phantasm dissipates when: its endurance drops to zero; it is
dispelled by counterspell; its target dies or leaves the plane; the
Adept drops or loses concentration. The Adept has some awareness of
the phantasm's location, and is aware of its dissipation.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Telekinesis}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: maximum 10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity or object}
\begin{effects}
Allows the Adept to lift and manoeuvre a target weighting up to 2
pounds and move it at the rate of 2 TMR. The Adept may move an
additional 5 pounds or move the chosen target at an additional 3 TMR
per Rank. The Adept may increase both mass and speed by applying
separate ranks to each. Gross movement is automatic, although fine
movements require an MD check and should attract negative modifiers
for range.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Telekinetic Rage}

\range{30 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Instantaneous}
\multiple{750}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates an instantaneous, magical storm that fills the area
within range with roiling, body-wrenching forces. All objects and
entities that fail to resist, are hurled away from the Adept until
they are out of the area of effect, or they strike a solid barrier.

The storm inflicts [D - 5] (+ 1 / foot travelled) of magical damage
and is inflicted once only, at the time of casting. The damage is not
contingent on striking an object. Additional damage may be done on
hitting a wall, entity or other substantial object.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\begin{spell}[S-9]{Telepathy}

\range{30 feet + 30 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{550}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The spell gives the Adept the ability to read the surface thoughts of
any entity within range who fails to resist. Each target may only
resist each Telepathy once, regardless of whether they move in or out
of the range of the spell.

Each pulse, the Adept may use their telepathy to either locate the
minds that are within range, or to read the thoughts of a particular
mind. The Adept need not know the language of the entity whose
thoughts are being read, but will have difficulty comprehending the
thoughts of alien minds. Animal thoughts are usually very primitive
and can summed up in a single word, \eg ``food'', ``danger'', ``sex.''

It is not possible to utilise a target's senses and the Adept may only
gain an impression of physical sensations if the entity is
concentrating on them, \eg savouring a meal.

Telepathy may be used to target the Mind Speech, Mental Attack and
Phantasm spells.

Targets are not aware that their thoughts are being read.
Concentration checks should be required of targets who try to control
their thoughts by reciting poetry etc.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Transmutation}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{1000}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity or Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may transmute and rearrange the elemental components of any
target that fails to resist, transforming it into any form of the same
mass that the Adept desires. A living entity can only be rearranged
into another living form, and objects into objects. This spell cannot
confer skills or magical abilities, but the target will acquire the
non-magical features of the new form such as wings, gills etc, and may
use them. If the new form is maintained without disruption for the
duration of the spell, the target will revert to its original shape.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Undetectability}

\range{Touch}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{May not be resisted}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target is totally undetectable by physical senses. Changes to the
physical environment which are made by the target and are entirely
within 5 feet (+ 1 / Rank) (\eg leaves tracks, opens doors, picks up
an object) will be unnoticed by normal observers. Other entities will
automatically take such changes in their stride (\eg will just walk
through the previously shut door, will not sit down on the chair that
the target whipped out from under them but go and get another drink
instead).

Magical observation (Wizards Eye, Witchsight, Clair-audience etc) will
not detect the target. The spell does not however, affect indirect
observation, such as Locate, Telepathy or ESP.

The Adept may nominate, at the time of casting, up to 1 (+ 1 / 3 full
Ranks) entities who will ignore the workings of the spell.

The spell will dissipate if the target is in physical contact with
another entity for more than 5 seconds (other than the nominated
entities) or makes a strike check for a non-ranged attack (regardless
of its success). The target may choose to end the spell at any time.
\end{effects}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Resist Pain}

a76 15
Adepts of this College are more or less immune to pain. They cannot be
tortured or stunned. In addition, if there is a chance that their
concentration may have been broken, 5 (+ 1 / Rank) is always added to
the Base Chance of their maintaining the concentration despite
intrusions.

Their concentration is never automatically broken (\ie is never
broken without a check to see if they maintain concentration).

Since this is a magical talent, it is affected by cold iron. However,
for a weapon to affect the talent, the weapon must be cold iron, must
have done endurance damage, and must remain in contact with the
body. If cold iron is used in the torture of a mind mage, the Adept
adds their concentration bonus to the base chance of resisting the
torture attempt.

The Adept can sense the presence and general mood (but not the exact
nature) of any entity within range of the spell.  ESP will detect the
presence of an entity even if that entity is mind cloaked.  Spells
cannot be targetted through ESP.

them.  This spell works at any range.
\end{effects}

d128 19
a146 5
The Adept cloaks their own mind so that their thoughts cannot be
detected or ``read'', \eg by Spell of Telepathy (S-2) or other mind
reading talents, spells or rituals. The Adept's Resistance versus
Mental Attack (S-1) is increased by 10 (+ 2 / Rank) while the spell is
in effect.
d150 1
a150 1
\begin{spell}[G-4]{Empathy}
d164 28
a191 5
from their own Fatigue (never Endurance). Thus, an Adept could remove
6 Damage Points from a target by inflicting 3 of the 6 on themselves
(the other 3 being eliminated). At Rank 10 or higher, the Adept can
cast this spell on characters who are 15 feet (+ 15 / Rank - 10) or
less from them.
d205 16
a220 15
The Adept may lull an entity into a trance-like state in which they
will be subject to suggestion.  The spell may only be cast over a
target with whom the caster is normally able to communicate
verbally. It can never be cast over a totally hostile target.  Once
the subject has been hypnotized, the Adept can make suggestions which
the subject will readily accept unless they conflict directly with
their best interests.  The subject will remain suggestible so long as
concentration is maintained and will continue to implement the
post-hypnotic suggestion for 3 (+ 3 / Rank) hours after the spell
ceases. The subject will never have any idea where the suggestions
they are implementing came from.

Only one post-hypnotic suggestion may be made per spell. The duration
of the spell is concentration -- it is only the post-hypnotic
suggestion that has a time duration.

\target{Animal}
d234 10
a243 7
The Adept gains control over every action of one animal within
range. If they release the animal or their concentration is broken it
may attack them.

The Adept controls the animal's mind and body, \eg it is only
possible to make a bird fly if the Adept is intimately familiar with
the function of flying.
d247 1

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Controlling Person}

\target{Sentient Entity}
d257 6
a262 6
The Adept gains control over every action of one person within
range. They may control the physical activities of that person, but
may not cause the target to cast spells. The subject always acts as if
they were also affected by a Spell of Slowness (E\&E S-11). The spell
continues in effect until the Adept's concentration is broken or they
release the victim.
d266 1
a266 1
\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}
a268 1

d276 13
a288 15
The Adept may employ this ritual in order to bind the will of an
entity that is physically present and either unconscious or otherwise
restrained. The Adept may perform no other action while engaged in the
performance of this ritual.  Once bound, the subject will remain bound
until the effects of the ritual wear off or they break the psychic
bonds restraining them. The subject gets a chance to passively resist
once at the end of the ritual and once at the end of each day. If they
successfully resist, the bonds are broken and they are free.  Until
that time, they will be the loyal retainer of the Adept and serve them
in all things.  The Adept may never release the subject from servitude
voluntarily, and the magic continues to work even after the Adept is
dead (the subject will do all within their power to attempt to get the
Adept resurrected).  If the ritual backfires, the Adept loses D10 from
their willpower in addition to any other backfire effect; hypnotism
(G-5) cures this loss.
d294 1

a302 1
\target{Entity}
d304 8
a311 6
The Adept may cast this spell at any entity within range who can be
seen or whose position has been pinpointed via Telepathy (S-2). If the
target fails to resist, they fall unconscious for the duration of the
spell. In addition, at Rank 15 and above they lose [D - 5] from
Willpower. This loss of Willpower may be cured via hypnotism
(G-5). Once hypnotised, the subject is totally cured.
d315 1
a315 1
\begin{spell}[S-2]{Telepathy}
d317 1
a317 1
\range{30 feet + 30 / Rank}
d319 3
a321 3
\multiple{550}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Passive}
d325 3
a327 10
The spell gives the Adept the ability to read the thoughts of any
entity within range, who fails to resist.  Each pulse, the Adept may
use their telepathy to either locate the minds that are within range,
or to read the thoughts of a particular mind.  The Adept need not know
the language of the entity whose thoughts are being read, but will
have difficulty comprehending the thoughts of alien minds.  Entities
only get to resist telepathy once, regardless of whether they move in
or out of range of the spell.  Animal thoughts are usually very
primitive and can summed up in a single word, \eg ``food'',
``danger'', ``sex.''
d331 1
a331 1
\begin{spell}[S-3]{Phantasm}
d333 4
a336 4
\range{Special}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{1\%}
d338 1
a338 1
\storage{Investment}
d341 4
a344 20
The spell conjures a beast with an Endurance and Fatigue with a
combined value of 20 (+ 5 / 3 full Ranks).  The creature is a magical
entity which must be targeted at a particular victim. It will then
track the victim down and attack them until either the victim is
killed, the victim kills it or the phantasm is dispelled (with a
counterspell). The phantasm always hits for [D - 4] (+ 1 / Rank)
damage per pulse.

The target can only be an entity who is can be seen by the Adept or
uniquely identified by Telepathy, or whose Individual True Name is
known and used in the spell.  The TMR of a phantasm is 1 + 1 /
Rank. The phantasm is unseeable rather than invisible to all except
the target, including the Adept. The phantasm will be dispelled if an
area effect Mind Special Knowledge counterspell is cast on an area
that the phantasm occupies, but it can enter an already existing area
counterspell.

The phantasm appears as an horrific nightmare from the target's
subconscious, hence the Adept cannot choose its appearance.  A
phantasm always acts last in the pulse.
d348 1

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Molecular Disruption}
d351 4
a354 4
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Passive}
d358 7
a364 4
This spell causes cellular damage to any living being or being in
corporeal (substantial rather than insubstantial) form. It does [D +
1] (+ 1 / Rank) to any single target that fails to resist and half
damage (round up) to any target that successfully resists.
d368 1
a368 1
\begin{spell}[S-5]{Molecular Rearrangement}
d370 1

\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity or Object}
d378 16
a393 5
The Adept may rearrange the cells of any target that fails to resist,
turning it into any shape of the same mass that they desire.

If the new form is maintained without disruption for the duration of
the spell, the target may revert to its original shape.
d397 1
a397 1
\begin{spell}[S-6]{Force Shield}
d399 6
a404 20
\range{Self}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
Reduces the Base Chance of the Adept being hit by 5 (+ 1 / Rank).

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Healing}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{375}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
d407 27
a433 2
The Adept may heal the target of 2 (+ 1 / Rank) Damage Points that
have been removed from the subject's Fatigue or Endurance.
d437 1
a437 1
\begin{spell}[S-8]{Undetectability}
d440 1
a440 40
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell becomes undetectable (other than by touch).
The target may be detected if an observing entity makes a 1 \x
perception roll. Only one perception roll is made per entity for the
duration of the spell, irrespective of the target of the spell's
actions.

The target of the spell is effectively invisible (per E\&E G-8, but
cannot be seen by Witchsight or other magical means) and therefore has
no shadow or reflection. The target also emits no odour and leaves no
scent. The target makes no audible sound from its direct action,
although secondary effects are possible. Thus where the target or its
possessions interface with the external environment, no sound is made,
however the adept may make sound using non-possessions.
\begin{example}
An undetectable horse will make no sound crossing a cobblestone
courtyard; an undetectable man will make no sound knocking on a door,
however if he uses the knocker he will (as neither knocker nor door
are possessions).
\end{example}
The target of this spell may initiate physical attacks or spell
casting without the spell ceasing effect. The spell may not be
terminated voluntarily (other than by way of counterspell).

It may be possible to detect a target of this spell using mundane
means. For example the target of this spell will leave footprints in
the sand, would leave a hole in a room full of dust.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Telekinesis}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
d447 7
a453 4
Allows the Adept to lift the target with weight of up to 2 pounds and
move it at the rate of 2 TMR.  The Adept may choose to move an
additional 5 pounds or increase the spell by an additional 3 TMR for
each Rank in the spell.
d457 1
a457 1
\begin{spell}[S-10]{Telekinetic Rage}
d460 1
a460 1
\duration{Concentration: maximum 60 seconds + 10 / Rank}
d463 24
a486 1
\resist{Active, Passive}
d490 22
a511 4
The Adept creates a storm of force emanating from them which hurls any
object or entity away from them at bone-breaking speed until out of
the range of the spell.  Anything which fails to resist suffers [D -
5] (+ 1 / foot travelled) damage.
d515 1
a515 1
\begin{spell}[S-11]{Mind Speech}
d517 1
a517 1
\range{30 feet + 30 / Rank}

\multiple{400}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity}
d525 8
a532 5
Allows the Adept to communicate telepathically with 1 + 1 / Rank
entities. The entities targeted must be both within the range of the
spell and either in sight or pinpointed via the Spell of Telepathy (at
the time of casting). If the entity subsequently leaves the range, the
communication continues.

The Adept can bind any element (Earth, Air, Fire or Water) as if he
were performing the binding ritual for the College dealing with that
element. The ritual is conducted in exactly the same manner as the
specific ritual for binding the element apart from Base Chance and
EM. In all other ways the binding is executed according to the rules
governing the appropriate ritual of binding from the College concerned
with the element being bound.

the following points: For a weapon to affect the talent the weapon
must be cold iron, must have done endurance damage, and must remain in

The Adept gains control of the every action of one person within

may not cause him to cast spells). The subject always acts as if he

day. If they successfully resists, the bonds are broken and they are
free.  Until that time, they will be the loyal retainer of the Adept
and serve them in all things.  The Adept may never release the subject
from servitude voluntarily, and the magic continues to work even after
the Adept is dead (the subject will dispose of the body and take the
deceased's personal effects to their widow/widower). If the ritual
backfires, the Adept loses D10 from their willpower; hypnotism (G-5)
cures this loss.

The Adept may lull an entity of his choice that is within range into a
trance-like state in which he will be subject to suggestion.  The
spell may only be cast over a target with whom the caster is normally
able to communicate verbally. It can never be cast over a totally
hostile character. Once the subject has been hypnotized, the Adept can
make suggestions which the subject will readily accept unless they
conflict directly with their best interests.  The subject will remain
suggestible so long as concentration is maintained and will continue
to implement suggestions for 3 (+ 3 / Rank) hours after the suggestion
has been made, even when no longer hypnotized. The subject will never
have any idea where the suggestions they are implementing came from.

damage. It need not make a Strike Check when it hits.  The phantasm is
invisible to all but the victim.

Phantasms require the active concentration of the caster, i.e.  caster
cannot sleep or cast other concentration spells while keeping a
phantasm going. They can only be cast on an entity being seen or
uniquely identified by telepathy. The TMR of a phantasm is 1 + 1 /
Rank. The phantasm is unseeable rather than invisible to all others
than the target -- this includes the caster. The phantasm will be
dispelled if an area effect counter spell of the appropriate college
(Mind Special) is cast on an area that phantasm occupies, but it can
walk into an already existing counterspell with no effects. A phantasm
cannot do critical or endurance blows.

Adepts of this College are more or less immune to pain.  They cannot
be tortured or stunned.  In addition, if there is a chance that their
concentration may have been broken, 5 (+ 1 / Rank) is always added to the
Base Chance of their maintaining the concentration despite intrusions.

Since this magical talen, it must be affected by cold iron.  However,
note the following points :
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item
For a weapon to affect the talent the weaspon must be cold iron, must
have done endurance damage, and must remain in contact with the body.
\item
If cold iron is used in the torture of a mind mage, then the Adept
adds their concentration bonus to the base chance of resisting the
torture attempt.

{\em Effects:} The spell allows the Adept to feel the emotions and
physical sensations the target of the spell is currently experiencing.
It also allows the Adept to absorb wounds from Endurance and Fatigue
at a rate of 2 poin's cured for every 1 which the Adept agrees to
subtract from their own Fatigue (never Endurance).  Thus, an Adept
could remove 6 Damage Points from a character by inflicting 3 of the 6
on himself (the other 3 being eliminated).  At Rank 10 or higher, the
Adept can cast this spell on characters who are 15 feet (+15/Rank) or

{\em Effects:} The Adept may lull an entity of his choice that is
within range into a trance-like state in which he will be subject to
suggestion. The spell may only be cast over a target with whom the
caster is normally able to communicate verbally.  lt can never be cast
over a totally hostile character.  Once the subject has been
hypnotized, the Adept can make suggestions which the subject will
readily accept unless they conflict directly with their best
interests.  The subject will remain suggestable so long as
concentration is maintained and will continue to implement suggestions
for 3 (+ 3 / Rank) hours after the suggestion has been made, even when no
longer hypnotized. The subject will never have any idea where the
suggestions they are implementing came from.

{\em Effects:} The Adept gains control of the every action of one
person within range.  They may control the physical activities of that
person (but may not cause him to cast spells).  The subject always
acts as if he was also affected by a Spell of Slowness (Ensorcelments
and Enchantments (S-11).  The spell continues in effect until the
Adept's concentration is broken or they release the victim.

until the effects of the ritual wear off or he breaks the psychic
bounds restraining him.  The subject gets a chance to passively
resist once during the performance of the ritual and once at the end
of each day.  If he successfully resists, the bonds are broken and he
is free.  Until that time, he will be the loyal retainer of the Adept
and serve him in all things.  The Adept may never release the subject

Ehe Adept is dead (the subject will dispose of the body and take the
deceased's personal effects to his widow/widower).  If the ritual
backfires, the Adept loses D1O from his willpower; hypnotism (G-5)
may cure this loss.

{\em Effects:} The Adept may cast this spell at any character within
range who can be seen or whose position has been pinpointed via
Telpathy (S-2). If the target fails to resist a successful spellcast,
he falls unconscious.  In addition, at Ranks of 15 and above he loses
[D - 5] from Willpower.  This loss from Willpower may be cured via
hypnotism (G-5) only (once hypnotised, tne subject is totally cured).

\end{spelldesc}
{\em Effects:} The spell conjures a beast with an Endurance and
Fatigue with a combined value of 20 (+ 5 additional points for each 3
Ranks).  The creature is a physical entity which must be targeted at a
particular victim.  It will then track the victim down and attack them
until either the victim is killed or the phantasm is dispelled (using
a counterspell).  The phantasm always bits for [D - 4] (+ 1 / Rank)
damage.  It need not make a Strike Check when it hits.  The phantasm
is invisible to all but the victim.

desire.

entities after the duration of the spell has ended.  The current

{\em Target:} Entity \\
\end{spelldesc}
{\em Effects:} The target of this spell becomes undetectable (other
than by touch).  The target may be detected if an observing entity
makes a 1 \x perception roll.  Only one perception roll is made
per entity for the duration of the spell, irrespective of the target
of the spell's actions.  The target of the spell is effectively
invisible (per E\&E G-8, but cannot be seen by Witchsight or other
magical means) and therefore has no shodow or relection.  The target
also emits no odour and leaves no scent.  The target makes no audible
sound from its direct action, although secondary effects are possible.
Thus where the target or its possessions interface with the external
environment, no sound is made, however the adept may make sound using
non-possessions.  Examples are: an undetectable horse will make no
sound crossing a cobblestone courtyard; an undetectable man will make
no sound knocking on a door, however if he uses the knocker
he will (as neither knocker nor door are possessions).

The target of this spell may initiate physical atiicks or spell casting
without the spell ceasing effect.  The spell may not be terminated
voluntarily (other than by way of counterspell).

the sand, would leave a hole in a room full of dust (as the dust in
contact withthe target would become a possession and therefore
undetectable).

The spell may only be cast over entities.  The spell encompasses all
the target's possessions.  Possessions are non-entity things which are
worn or carried.  An unconscious or sleeping entity is not a
possession.

This spell may be made into a potion, invested, or warded.
