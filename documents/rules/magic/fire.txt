\begin{college}[2.0]{fire}{Fire Magics}{FI}

\textbf{This College is a probationary College. This means that this
College is under trial for two years (as of January 2000). All
characters that join this College do so under the understanding that
if this College is deemed unplayable, it may be withdrawn or radically
changed. At that point, all such characters may have the EP and time
spent in this College refunded, to be re-spent freely in another
College as if that College had been their original choice.}

The College of Fire Magics is concerned exclusively with manipulating
the element of fire. Adepts of this College are referred to as Fire
Mages or Pyromancers.

The affinity fire mages have for their element has often led to them
being considered to be pyromaniacs. Most fire mages, however, have a
healthy respect for fire, and rarely will they wantonly set people or
places alight. They do enjoy being in or near fire and are generally
the first to suggest a nice camp fire when adventuring. Fire mages are
also thought to be hot-tempered, to enjoy hot and spicy food, and to
dislike getting wet. They frequently have red hair, though there
appears to be no hereditary basis for this. Generally fire mages are
flamboyant characters, particularly in their spell-casting. The
College of Fire Magics is anything but subtle, and its spells involve
more than the usual amounts of shouting and arm-waving.

The element of fire is unquestionably destructive, and as a
consequence the majority of the spells of this college cause
considerable amount of damage, if only as a side-effect. The Fire
College is not noted for being environmentally friendly, and so fire
mages are even less popular than most mages among the common
folk. When it is revealed that a person is an Adept of the Fire
College the usual reaction will generally be 1 of fear and
trepidation. Fire mages are quite amicable towards the Adepts of other
colleges with the notable exception of those of the College of Water
Magics.

\subsubsection{Traditional colours}

Fire mages generally prefer to wear red, the colour of their element,
often trimmed with black, yellow or orange. For jewellery the fire
mage most frequently chooses garnets or rubies, set in gold.

\subsubsection{Traditional symbols}

The symbol of the Fire College is the flame, usually depicted in red
or gold.

\subsection{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Fire Magics may only practice their arts in
an area where it is possible for fire to exist. They may not practice
fire magic underwater or in a vacuum, for example.

The MA requirement for this college is 12.

\subsection{Modifications}

The Base Chance of performing any talent, spell or ritual of the
College of Fire Magics is modified by addition of the following
numbers:

{\small
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Adept is in light mist, fog, or rain, or is soaking wet &  -5 \\ 
Adept is in heavy fog, or rain, or is partially immersed in water &  -10 \\ 
Adept is almost totally immersed in water &  -15 \\ 
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}


\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Adept is within 30 feet of large campfire &  +5 \\ 
Adept is within 30 feet of bonfire &  +10 \\ 
Adept is in contact with small campfire &  +5 \\ 
Adept is in contact with large campfire &  +10 \\ 
Adept is in contact with bonfire &  +15
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}


\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Adept is in a hot, dry region (such as a desert)	&  +5 \\ 
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}
}

Only one modifier from each group may be applied together. These
bonuses only apply to normal fire. Magical fire may only be used to
reduce negative modifiers to zero.

Unless otherwise specified, Magical Fire will automatically ignite
flammables.

\subsubsection{Damage by Burning}

Occasionally a character will suffer damage from fire, by ether
falling in to it, or being exposed to it. The following table
indicates the pulse by pulse damage taken by a character standing in
fire or by having their clothing etc, catching alight in the pulse
after exposure to a Fireball, Dragon Flames or passage through a Wall
of Fire etc.  While ignition of flammables on a person will not always
occur, spells that are immersive in nature \eg passage through a Wall
of Fire, or where a character deliberately stands in a fire, will
always result in ignition of flammable material.  If the pulse after
ignition is spent putting flammables out, no further damage occurs. In
general exposure to a fire source indicates exposure for a full pulse,
therefore standing in a bonfire might hurt a character but simply
jumping through one might not. The table below should be used as a
guide to how much damage exposure to a particular fire source might
cause.

{\small
\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Clothing alight after passage through a fire	&  D + 3 \\ 
Standing in campfire &  D + 5 \\ 
Standing in a one Hex bonfire &  D + 10 \\ 
Very large bonfire, house fire &  D + 15 \\ 
Raging forest fire &  D + 25 \\ 
Immersion in boiling water &  D + 35 \\ 
Immersion in boiling oil &  D + 50 \\ 
Immersion in molten metal or lava &  D + 100 \\ 
Sauron's forge &  D + 150 \\ 
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}}


\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Infravision}
\range{50 feet + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\resist{None}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to see heat sources as if they emitted normal
light. This works best in relative darkness, since it is easily
over-powered by visible light. Infravision can be used to target
weapons and spells. As a result of this talent the Adept can see in
the absence of visible light. Low level heat sources such as living
bodies give this talent a normal working range of 50 feet + 5 / Rank
to this talent. Medium level high sources such as campfires are
visible at twice this distance (note that the plume of hot air from a
fire will extend to a considerable height). High level heat sources
may be visible at any range. This talent can sometimes penetrate where
normal vision cannot.  For example, the Adept can see heat sources
through smoke and mist as long as the obscurement is not warmer than
the thing being viewed (at a 50\% reduction in range). The Adept can
perceive living entities attempting to hide in light cover (such as
bushes). It is also possible to detect the residual heat of a source,
which has recently been moved or extinguished. Should the Adept wish
to concentrate on a particular heat source, a check against a base
chance of perception + 5 / Rank - 1 / 10 feet separating the Adept
from the heat source (after the first 10 feet). If this is successful
the Adept can:

Identify the general type of heat source. Only those heat sources that
the Adept has previously encountered and as a consequence knows the
heat signature of may be identified with this talent. At higher ranks
familiar individuals may identified.  Determine the relative
temperature of the heat source.  Determine if the heat radiated by any
object or entity perceived by this talent is being generated by
magic. Thus the Adept may employ this talent to distinguish between
normal and magical fire. Only fire mage infravision has this
capability.

Should the talent fail it may be re-attempted after either the Adept
or target has moved so that the Adept is at least 20 feet closer to
the target, or after a period of 41 pulses - 2 / Rank has elapsed.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Pyrogenisis}

\range{Sight}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{MA + 5 / Rank - 1 / 5  feet separating the Adept from the target (after the first 5 feet)}
\resist{Passive}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cause a single mass of dry, flammable material to burst
into flame. This amount is equal to 1 oz + 1 oz for every 5 ranks the
Adept has attained in the talent. Thereafter it will burn normally and
may be extinguished by either mundane or magical means. Flammable
materials are to be defined as wood, paper, cloth etc, but not flesh,
with the exception that Pyrogenisis may be used to cremate insects and
small invertebrates \eg slugs, snails etc within the mass restrictions
detailed above. If the talent is used on another's possession this
talent will automatically fail. Utilizing this talent requires a pass
action, and it has an obvious somatic component. Should it fail the
talent may be re-attempted immediately.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Bolt of Fire}
\range{25 feet + 25 feet / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Ward, Investments, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity or Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept causes a bolt of elemental Fire to streak from their
outstretched hand towards the designated target for D10 (+ 1 / Rank)
fire damage. The bolt will always impact on the first target reached
so it may not for example, be bounced around rooms. If there is no
target in sight the bolt will dissipate at the end of its range. At
Rank 20 the Adept may delay releasing the bolt for a pulse if they
should choose.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Extinguish Fire Spell}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
When successfully cast, this spell will extinguish all fire in a cube
up to 10 (+ 10 / Rank) feet on a side. All the volume affected must be
within range of the spell. On a multiple effect this volume may be
doubled or tripled. The Adept may always choose to extinguish a
smaller volume of Fire than their maximum by rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Fire Armour}

\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Object or Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell protects the target against fire to the value of 4 (+ 4 /
Rank) points of protection. Protection is ablative and when the damage
the spell may absorb is exceeded, the spell ceases to be in effect
with the excess damage being applied to the character. Double and
triple effects apply to either duration or degree of protection. At
Rank 20 the spell confers 100 points of protection.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Firelight}
\range{Touch}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object or point}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a source of light emanating in all directions from
the object or point touched by the Adept. At ranks 0 to 5 the light
emitted is equivalent to that of a torch, at ranks 6 to 10 that of a
small campfire, at ranks 11 to 15 a large campfire, and at ranks 16 to
20 a bonfire. The light emitted will have the appearance of firelight
of the appropriate strength. It is magical light, and will cast poor
contrast shadows.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Fireproofing}
\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity or Object}
\begin{effects}
The spell protects the target from all non-magical fire and heat
effects up to the heat equivalent of a bonfire. An entity or object is
also protected against smoke effects (including smoke inhalation),
hypothermia and sunstroke.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Increase Temperature}
\range{Touch}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Volume, Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept must remain in contact with the object for heating to occur.
\begin{Description}
\item[Gases] Duration: 1 hour + 1 / Rank

The Adept may cause the temperature of a closed contiguous volume of
gas (such as air) to increase. The volume affected is equal to 125 (+
125 / Rank) cubic feet (125 cubic feet is the volume of a cube 5 feet
on each side). The temperature can be increased by up to 2C per
Rank. When the spell ends the affected volume will cool normally. At
Rank 20 the volume that can be affected by Increase Temperature is
doubled.

\item[Solids] Duration: 5 minutes + 5 / Rank

The Adept may heat solid material to a maximum of 50 (+ 50 / Rank)
degrees C. The mass which can be affected is equal to a maximum of 1lb
+ 1lb / Rank. The Adept may choose any combination of temperature
increase increment and mass increment to a total of the Adept's
rank. The temperature increase requires 10 seconds per 100 degrees per
pound mass. At Rank 20 any metal item within the weight limit of the
Adept can be reduced to molten slag in as little as 10 seconds
(resistance roll is applicable).

\item[Liquids] Duration: 5 minutes + 5 / Rank

The increase is equal to a maximum of 20 (+ 20 / Rank) degrees C. The
volume which can be affected is equal to a maximum of 1 (+ 1 / Rank)
pint. The Adept may choose any combination of temperature increase
increment and mass increment to a total of the Adept's rank. The
temperature increase requires 10 seconds per 10 degrees per pint. When
the spell effect ends the solid material or the volume of liquid will
cool normally. The volume of material that may be effected is
increased by 6 times at Rank 20.
\end{Description}
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Slow Fire}
\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell increases the duration that a wood, lamp or oil fire will
burn for by 1 (+ 1 / Rank) hours. Light remains constant while the
spell is in effect but heat from the fire source is halved. Double and
triple effects apply to duration. This spell may be used to slow the
effects of small fires or to ensure a fire lasts for a considerable
period of time.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Smoke Creation}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may create a volume of smoke equal to 1000 (+500 / Rank)
cubic feet. This volume must be closed and contiguous, and has a
minimum thickness of 5 feet. The density of the smoke may vary from
light vapors at Rank 0 to thick, roiling smoke at Rank 20. The Adept
at casting may vary the density of the smoke. The smoke produced
reduces visual perception by 1 level per 5 full ranks (but may not
reduce it to less than once times perception). Thus at Rank 10 a 4 \x
perception check reduces to 2 \x perception check. The effective Rank
of the spell will be decreased by 1 Rank per 10 miles/hour of wind, to
a minimum of Rank 0, if cast out of doors or in a space where wind is
present.  Below rank 10 the smoke created by this spell is completely
transparent to infravision.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}
\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Binding Fire}
\range{10 feet + 10 feet / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{None}
\target{Fire}
\material{Fire source + special}
\actions{Chanting and dancing}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
If the ritual is successful the Adept gains complete control over a
fire source as large as 10 (+ 10 / Rank) cubic feet.  This fire may
then be moulded and shaped as desired but with a minimum of one foot
thickness in any dimension. Regardless of the shape created, the fire
retains its normal heat and damaging properties. Damage is as per a
large bonfire or [D - 3] if the entity is within one hex. Bound fire
is unaffected by normal rains and winds short of hurricane conditions,
but may be extinguished by a dousing of water of similar or greater
volume than the fire. If the Adept sacrifices 2 points of Endurance
from a sentient as part of the ritual, the duration of the Ritual of
Binding Fire is enhanced to 1 (+ 1 / Rank) years.  While expensive, a
Ritual of Binding Fire may be made permanent. This may only be
accomplished by the sacrifice of at least 4 points of Endurance from a
sentient creature. In these cases the Fire is bound to a specific
nonmovable item from which the fire appears to issue \eg a ruby set in
a wall, a line of runes on a floor etc. For a permanent Bound Fire to
be negated, the object to which it is bound must be broken, destroyed
or defaced. Any other successful damage to a permanent Bound Fire
simply suppresses the Fire for Rank minutes \eg dousing with the
required volume of water, attack with Ray of Cold for more damage than
the damage rating of the Bound Fire etc.

The Adept may instil intelligence in a Bound Fire if desired and give
the entity thus created simple commands.  Examples ``Protect me'' or
``only allow those to pass who say zebus'' etc.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Cleansing Flame Spell}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank above 10}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Potion, Ward, and Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target is wreathed in yellowy green flames causing hideous
suffering, yet curing the target entity of the effects of natural
poisons (acts as Rank / 2 for synthetic poison), venoms, fevers and
diseases; halting the deleterious effects while cleansing takes
place. As the foulness is burnt away, the flames change colour until
they become silvery white. The time required to heal a target is 25
pulses - 1 / Rank. At the end of the spell, the target and his
possessions are cleaned to a high polish. During the cleansing all
Strike Chances, Defence and Cast Chances are reduced by 25 - 1 /
Rank. This spell only affects willing targets. At Rank 20 this spell
also cures the effects of Malignant Flames. This spell can also be
used to cure burns, including third degree burns but scaring from
burns are not affected.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Dragon Flames}
\range{Special}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
Allows the Adept to breath magical fire like a Dragon for D10 (+ 3 /
Rank).  If the target resists then they take half damage.  The cone
issues from the Adepts mouth and is 20 (+ 5 / Rank) feet in length and
5 (+ 5 / 3 Ranks) feet in width at the end farthest from the Adept. In
some instances, \eg a character wading through water, a resistance
roll may negate all damage.  There are no over-pressure or explosive
effects.  Dragon Flames is analogous to an instantaneous flash of
heat.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Fire Arc}
\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell transforms the target in to a bolt of fire that flashes to
any unobstructed point in line of sight up to 25 (+ 25 / Rank) feet
away. The bolt must appear within 5 feet of a potentially flammable
substance, an entity or a solid surface. When the bolt arrives, it
arrives in a burst of flame for D10 damage to all creatures within 1
hex. The Adept may effect 1 + 1 creatures for every 3 full ranks or
fractions there of.  At Rank 20 the Adept may instantaneously return
to the point of origin of the spell at the end of the next pulse
should they so desire. Double and triple effects can be applied to
range only. This spell affects only willing targets and will not work
underwater. Any barriers, wards etc that are passed over affect the
targets as if crossed normally.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Fireball}
\range{60 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity, Object}
\begin{effects}
The spell conjures a ball of fire 1 foot in diameter which rushes to
the point selected by the Adept, exploding in a radius of 5 (+ 5 every
5 or fraction Ranks) feet. Damage is D10 (+ 1 / Rank), with the target
taking half if they sucessfully resist.  The spell may set flammable
items alight when it bursts. Hard cover (\eg walls, parapets,
mantelets but not shields) reduces damage to 1/2 before resistance is
rolled. There are no over-pressure or explosive effects --- the
fireball is analogous to an instantaneous flash of heat. A fireball
may be detonated prematurely by the imposition of barriers in its line
of flight and it may only be aimed at a point that the Adept can see
and which is in range. At Rank 20 this spell may be cast with a
detonation delay of up to 10 pulses. If this option is chosen then
casting time is extended to 4 pulses as the mage must include the
``delay'' factor in his casting. A delayed blast fireball manifests
itself as a 1 foot diameter floating sphere of fire until detonation
occurs. If a second fireball is cast within the proposed volume of
effect of the first, both are detonated.

Note: There are some instances where resisting the spell will negate
all damage.  For example, the target is wading through deep water.
\end{effects}

\end{spell}
\begin{spell}[S-5]{Heat Shield}
\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Object or Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates a magical sheath of heat to protect the body
against cold or ice damage for 4 (+ 4 / Rank) points of protection.
Protection is ablative and when the damage the spell may absorb is
exceeded, the spell ceases to be in effect with the excess applied to
the character. Double and triple effects may be applied to either
duration or degree of protection.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Hellfire}
\range{10 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{650}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This sulphurous fire attacks 1 target for every 3 (or fraction)
Ranks. The target's Magical Resistance is reduced by 5 (+ 1 /
Rank). The spell does D10 (+ 2 / Rank) damage to each target. If a
target successfully resists, they suffer only half damage (round up).
Double damage add an additional 1 / Rank damage and triple damage adds
an additional 2 / Rank damage.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Immolation}
\range{Self}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Touch}
\begin{effects}
The Adept gains the grace and form of a dancing flame, without in
anyway altering their physical nature, but increasing their defence by
2 (+ 3 / 2 Ranks). Any entity that is within 5 feet must resist or
take 1 point of Fire damage per pulse for every 2 or fraction Ranks of
the Adept. Any entity under the influence of this spell will glow with
the same degree of brightness as a Firelight spell 5 Ranks lower,
minimum 1. Should the target choose to hide in a fire, the target may
only be detected by Witchsight, Wizardsight or by infravision.
Otherwise the target appears to be a humanoid shape composed of flame.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Malignant Flames}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{550}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
A target of the Adept 's choice is swathed in flames that are only
visible to the victim. The flames do D10 (+ 2 / Rank) damage.  If the
target resists they suffer half damage.  In addition the target is
subject to other damage if the spell is at rank 5 or higher. In this
case, a number of points equal to [D - 4] + (1 / 5 full Ranks) are
removed from 1 characteristic or statistic of the victim. The victim
will regain these points after (4 + Rank) days or after a remove curse
ritual is performed over the victim. The Adept may determine the
characteristic to be affected. A characteristic may not be reduced
below 1 as a result of this spell. At Rank 20 a victim may be affected
for (4 + Rank) days.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Pyrotechnics}
\range{60 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity, Object, Point}
\begin{effects}
This spell may be mistaken for a Fireball. A small 1 foot globe of
Fire streaks to the target, then bursts with an enormous flash of
light, smoke and fireworks. All those in the area of effect who see
the explosion must resist or be are dazzled and left blinking by the
flash for [D - 5] (+ 1 / 3 or fraction Ranks) pulses.  Dazzled
entities have their strike chances reduced by 1 (+ 2 / Rank) of the
Adept. Perception and casting checks are reduced by the same amount.
The volume affected by the spell is a radius centred on a hex of 5 (+
5 / 3 or fraction Ranks) feet. Creatures without normal vision, \eg
the undead, are unaffected by Pyrotechnics. Double and triple effects
may be applied to range only.  The Adept can always cast a smaller
radius effect if desired to a minium of 5 feet.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Speak to Fire Creatures}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
This spell allows the Adept to communicate with all fire creatures
within range. This communication is at an effective language rank of 1
(+ 1 / 2 Ranks). For the purposes of this spell, fire creatures are:
Elementals, Salamanders, Efreets, desert creatures and creatures
created using a Binding Fire Ritual.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Summoning Salamander}
\range{Unlimited}
\duration{Until dispelled}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Salamander}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon a salamander, which will then attempt to set
afire anything flammable that it can reach.  The Summoner will have no
control over the salamander. Casting a Special Knowledge Counterspell
is the only way to dispel the salamander. The summoning of a
Salamander may only occur in the presence of a large fire source or in
environmental conditions conducive to the survival of the entity \eg
near a bonfire, volcano, in a desert.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-12]{Weapon of Flames}

\duration{5 minutes + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Special}
\begin{effects}
The spell is cast over a weapon of the Adept's choice causing it to
burst into flame but without causing damage to the weapon or its
wielder. The Strike Chance to hit a target with the weapon is
increased by 1 (+ 1 / Rank), and damage is increased by 1 / 2 Ranks of
the Adept. When the weapon is used against a creature of cold or water
or against the Undead, damage increases to 1 / Rank. All creatures
that live in cold environments or in water are considered creatures of
cold or water. At rank 11 any hand-held weapon may be created from
fire. Such weapons have little actual weight, but strength and
dexterity requirements must be met as per normal. Missiles may also be
affected by this spell, but not missile weapons, thus an arrow may be
enflamed but not a bow.

wall of flames, or a 5 foot high \x 1 foot thick circle of flames with
a 5 foot radius, or a pillar 15 feet high with a 2 foot radius. The
Adept can increase any 1 dimension by 1 foot per Rank. The wall cannot
easily be seen through, and must be anchored to a surface. Any object
or entity that passes through the wall must resist or suffer [D +
Rank] damage (resist for half). The wall will provide light equivalent
to a Firelight spell or a large campfire. At Rank 20 the Adept may
double the damage of a Wall of Fire by halving its duration.

\begin{spell}[S-14]{Wildfires}
\range{Touch}
\duration{20 minutes + 20 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell imbues a character with the speed and essence of a forest
fire. The character may run without tiring at a speed of 20 (+ 2 /
Rank) miles per hour over any solid surface. Additionally a character
may ``run'' across any substance that would ordinarily support a fire
\eg a character under the effect of a Wildfires spell could run across
tree tops, up a wooden gate or palisade or across oil spread over
water. Like a fire, momentum effects do not apply to a character under
Wildfires, they may take corners at impossible angles, climb any
flammable surface \eg a tree, impossibly quickly, or stop instantly in
place. A character under Wildfires may leap such as a fire leaps a
firebreak. This distance is equal to 1 \x PS + 1 foot per rank of
horizontal distance or 1/2 PS + 1 foot per rank vertically. This spell
may be ended at any time prior to expiry and on expiry the character
stops instantly in place, much like a fire at the end of a burn. Prior
to this a character must continue to move at the designated speed for
at least two hexes of forward or lateral motion per pulse. At Rank 20
a character under Wildfires may continue to run beyond the normal
duration of the spell by suffering 1 point of Endurance damage for
each additional 10 minutes that they run. This spell leaves charred
footprints behind the user but these will only ignite substances
coated in oil or similarly materials, not ordinary wood. This spell
may be actively resisted. Double and triple effects may only be
applied to duration. A character under Wildfires is moving too quickly
to undertake normal tactical combat or to otherwise interact with
other characters. If they wish to engage in melee they must end the
duration of the spell.

\subsection{Special Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[R-1]{Create Drought}
\range{2 miles + 2 / Rank}
\duration{8 hours + 8 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{30\% + 3\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Area}
\material{Fire source}
\actions{Chanting and dancing}
\concentration{	standard}
\begin{effects}
This ritual increases temperature in the target area by 2 degrees C
per Rank, slowly building up at 2 degrees C per hour. This may impede
rainfall, kills plants, dry up wells, ponds, and ruin crops if
repeated regularly. In cold or icy areas climes it may make an area
tolerable for life for a time or result in standing fogs if the
difference between climes is too extreme.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-2]{Flame Sight}
\range{Adjacent fire}
\duration{1 minute + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{40\% + 5\% / Rank}
\material{Fuel for fire}
\actions{Concentration, looking into the flames}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may, after concentrating for half an hour and staring into
the flames of a fire, attempt to obtain 1 of 3 types of vision (as
determined by the Adept).
\begin{Itemize}
\item
A view as if the Adept was looking out of any fire within 1/2 a mile
(+ 1/4 mile / Rank). If there are a number of fires within range, the
fire the Adept looks out of is randomly determined, unless the Adept
knows of a specific fire (within range) and chooses to look out of
this particular fire. Should no fires exist within range, the Adept
will see nothing. The Adept cannot be perceived by anyone looking into
the fire, and may move their viewpoint within the fire so as to see in
all directions.

\item
A precognitive vision (which is not controllable by the Adept). The
detail of this vision and the amount of information obtained is
dependant on rank.


\item
If the Adept chooses to sacrifice an object (which is destroyed) in
the fire, they gain a vision relevant to that object's past. This
version of the ritual can only be performed on flammable objects.
\end{Itemize}
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-3]{Ritual of Summoning a Lesser Efreeti}
\range{5 feet}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{30\% + 3\% / Rank}
\casttime{3 Hours - 10 minutes / Rank (minimum of 10 minutes)}
\begin{effects}
Summons a Lesser Efreeti to act as a stead for a Fire Adept. The
Lesser Efreeti begins as a single hex mount with a base Endurance,
Strength and Fatigue of 30. These characteristics increase at a rate
of 2 points of Strength and Fatigue for every Rank of the Adept, and 1
Point of Endurance per Rank. The exception to this is at Rank 20 at
which point the Lesser Efreeti has an Endurance of 60, Strength and
Fatigue of 80. The size of the Lesser Efreeti likewise increases. It
begins as a one hex monster, increases to 2 hexes at Rank 12, and 3
hexes at Rank 20.

Damage from an Lesser Efreeti comes from two sources, the fire from
which it is composed and from its physical attacks. The entity has
three attacks, two claws and a bite. These increase in power as
follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
Rank 0: & D + 4 \\
Rank 4: & D + 6 \\
Rank 8: & D + 8 \\
Rank 12:&  D + 10 \\
Rank 16: & D + 12 \\
Rank 20: &D + 16 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The Lesser Efreeti has a 65\% chance of igniting in battle and damage
is D10 (+ 1 / 2 Rank), resist for 1/2. This extends in a 5 feet radius
from the creature. This fire does not affect the Adept, nor does it
effect a person for whom a Lesser Efreeti is summoned (which is only
possible at Rank 20).

The hide of the Lesser Efreeti also increases in toughness with the
rank of the Adept. It begins at an equivalent of 1/4 of the Adept's
Willpower and increases by 1 point for every 3 ranks of the Adept's
ritual. At Rank 20 the armour becomes equivalent to 1/4 the Adept's
Willpower + 8.

The willpower, magic resistance and all other faculties of the
creature are those of its Adept.  Prior to Rank 14, a Lesser Efreeti
will follow orders that remove it from the presence of the Adept only
if these are passive in nature (e.g. wait for me here, return to this
spot at this time, fly from this point to another. Prior to this it
cannot be given orders to attack or retrieve a particular entity or
thing unless the rider is atop the creature.

The creature moves in tactical combat at a TMR of 5 (+ 1 / 4 Ranks of
the Adept's ritual) when grounded, or 8 (+ 1 / 3 ranks of the Adept's
ritual) while in the air. Long distance movement is at a rate of 20 (+
2 / Rank) miles per hour. The duration of a summoned Lesser Efreeti at
Rank 20 is 24 hours.  Double and triple effects can be applied to
duration only.

A Lesser Efreeti ignores fire attacks, but its rider suffers damage as
normal. Ice and water attacks against the creature do twice the damage
and resistance to these attacks is at -10\%. The Lesser Efreeti has a
defence rating equal to the Willpower of its Adept + 1/2 the Adept's
\% chance of the ritual. The ritual may be invested, but at a cost of
50,000 silver pieces per charge. A Lesser Efreeti cannot be banished
while the Adept is atop his stead.

\begin{ritual}[R-4]{Summon Fire Elemental}
\range{Adjacent fire}
\duration{Concentration, no maximum}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{MA + 4\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Fire Elemental}
\material{Fuel for fire}
\actions{Concentration}
\concentration{ Standard}
\begin{effects}
The Adept summons a Fire Elemental with a combined endurance and
fatigue of 15 (+ 5 / Rank), within a fire, which must be constructed
within 20 feet of the Adept. If the ritual check is less than or equal
to the Adept's base chance, then the elemental is summoned and under
the Adept's control. If the result is 30 or more than the Adept's base
chance the ritual backfires, and the elemental arrives uncontrolled.
Any other result has no effect. The elemental strongly resents being
brought from the plane of elemental fire and therefore hates the Adept
and will immediately try to kill the Adept unless it is brought under
control. Once controlled, the elemental remains controlled until the
Adept's concentration is broken, it is banished, or the Adept returns
it to its own dimension with a special knowledge Counterspell.
