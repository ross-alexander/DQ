\section{Cantrips}
\index{cantrips}

Cantrips are minor magic effects, which come in two types. Glamour
cantrips are used to entertain and Household cantrips make life
pleasanter. Most cantrip effects can also be reversed.

\subsection{Restrictions}

The effects of cantrips are strictly minor in nature and cannot be
used during combat. Any mage can cast them and no preparation is
needed.  It costs 1 Fatigue to cast a cantrip.

\subsection{Modifiers \& Statistics}

All minor magics are non-college magic. College bonuses and penalties
do not apply to them. All Adepts will start off knowing the following
cantrips but they may not be ranked or improved, and do not affect the
number of low-ranked spells that may be learned.

\emph{Base Chance:} 3 \x MA 

Double or triple effects are not possible and should the roll exceed 4
\x MA the cantrip will backfire. Backfires result only in the effect
being distinctly different from the casters intentions. Actively
resisting a cantrip results in it automatically failing.

Any stronger magic of the same type as a cantrip will immediately
replace it and any area counterspell will dispel all cantrips within
range.  Where an Adept is casting a cantrip that has effects similar
or related to their college then the effects will be stronger, or more
convincing than normal although a cantrip can never be as effective as
any spell.

\subsection{Glamour Cantrips}

Glamour cantrips normally last (Base Chance) minutes.  The Adept may
choose to reduce the duration.
\begin{Description}

\item[Colour] The surface colour of one object may be changed. If cast
on an entity (\eg skin, hair, or eyes) the result is flat and not
particularly life like.

\item[Perfume] A faint pleasant (or unpleasant) scent permeates one
hex. Observers will not notice any specific odour, just that something
smells nice (or bad).

\item[Polish/Tarnish] One entity or object is spruced up so they look
smartly dressed or sparkling clean.  This doesn't make something look
more expensive merely newer and shinier.

\item[Fireworks] The Adept may combine any two of three effects in a 1
foot sphere which appears within 10 feet.  The effects are coloured
smoke, coloured lights, and a small sharp noise (\eg bang, tinkle,
fizzle).
\end{Description}

\subsection{Household Cantrips}

Household cantrips normally have an immediate effect and no duration.
\begin{Description}
\item[Candle] A small natural flame appears on an object and lasts 5
seconds.  If cast on something flammable the object may catch alight
(\eg wick, kindling).  The flame will shed light about 2 feet.

\item[Cool/Warm] Up to a pint of liquid, or a pound of food, may be
cooled or warmed a few degrees. This might cool hot food to an edible
temperature or warm milk, but not to boiling or freezing extremes.

\item[Clean/Dirty] Surface dirt and grime may be shed from an entity
or object to fall around them. If reversed all the loose dirt within
one hex attaches to the target.  Several casts may be requited to
removed thick mud or dirt and it will not remove old stains.

\item[Dry/Dampen] The cantrip will render up to one item of clothing
(or an object up to 3 pounds) either dry to the touch or damp. Several
casts may be required to dry sodden items or cause the target to drip
water.

\item[Insect Repellent] Small insects within one hex, or on one entity
leave as fast as they can. This effect lasts (Base Chance) minutes.

\item[Tie/Untie] causes strands to knit together, or fray apart.  This
can be used to knot string, repair minor rips in fabric, repair
fraying rope, or tangle or untangle hair etc.  It will not fill in
holes or seamlessly join completely separate things together.

\section{Minor Magics}
\label{minor.magic}
\index{magic!minor}

A feat of minor magic is generally performed to entertain. Such a feat
can also gull the credulous. Minor magics include the tricks used by
the prestidigitators \& conjurers of legend.

Minor magics are small magical effects, mostly in the area of
glamour.  Minor magical effects are called \emph{cantrips}.  No
preparation is needed to cast them.  Any area counterspell will remove
minor illusions and any non permanent cantrips (but not the effects).

do not apply to them. They may not be ranked or improved, and do not
affect the number of low-ranked spells that may be learned.  All
sentient entities will automatically resist minor magics unless
they choose otherwise.

The base chance of a cantrip is 3 \x MA.  Should the roll exceed 4 \x
MA the cantrip will backfire.  Backfires result only in the effect
being distinctly different from the casters intentions.

Below is a list of commonly used cantrips.  This list is a set of
examples and should not be considered exclusive or complete.
d42 17
a58 1
\begin{Description}
d60 1
a60 149
\item[Chill]
Up to a pint of liquid, or a pound of solid material, may be chilled
by as much as 20 degrees.  It may not be chilled below freezing point,
and will immediately begin to warm back to room temperature.

\item[Clean]
All dirt and grime may be removed from an amount of material
equivalent to one set of normal clothes.  If cast on an entity the
body will also be cleaned.  It is not possible to remove thick mud,
glue, blood, ink, etc.

\item[Colour] The surface colour of one object (or entity's skin,
hair, or eyes) may be intensified, or altered to a different hue.
This is an illusion, and can be readily countered by another colour
cantrip.  The colour will gradually fade over a period of about one
week.

\item[Coloured Lights] One or more globes of coloured light are
created by the caster for [D - 4] minutes.  These may be tossed
through the air, as long as they remain with ten feet of the caster.
They do not shed light on their surroundings.

\item[Curdle]
Causes the rate of natural decay to accelerate.  Milk will turn into
yoghurt, wine to vinegar, cheese will age, and bread dough will rise.
Other items may spoil more rapidly than normal.  The material is not
putrefied, and may well be quite edible.

\item[Dampen]
This cantrip will render up to one pound of permeable material (such
as paper) damp to the touch.  Objects so treated would be difficult to
set alight but will dry out normally.

\item[Dirty]
An amount of material equivalent to one set of normal clothes (or
another object with similar surface area) may be made dirty.  If cast
on an entity, the body will be dirtied also.  It is not possible to
impart thick mud, glue, blood, ink.

\item[Dry] The cantrip will render up to one pound of damp (but not
sodden) material dry to the touch.  It can be used to dry clothing,
but will not substitute for a towel.

\item[Dust] All dust can be removed from up to ten square feet of
surface.  The dust will settle naturally somewhere else.

\item[Dusty]
Dust can be precipitated from the air to cover up to ten square feet
of surface.

\item[Fire finger]
A magical flame, the size of that of a candle, appears balanced on one
of the caster's digits.  This flame will not harm the caster, or any
other entity, but can be used to light a fire or a torch.  It
illuminates a space about ten feet in diameter.

\item[Graffiti]
A faintly glowing mark appears on the surface of an object.  With
practise the caster can ``write'', or draw simple pictures.  The
image will immediately start to fade, and disappear within [D + 5]
minutes.

\item[Hairy] Causes the rate of natural hair (or fur) growth to
accelerate over the period of an hour.  The increase in hair length is
[D - 6] inches for human head hair, and other hair types in
proportion.

\item[Insect Attractant]
Small insects will be more attracted than usual to the entity on whom
this cantrip is cast for the duration (one hour).  Only insects
naturally present within five feet of the entity will be affected.

\item[Insect Repellant]
Small insects will repelled from the entity on whom this cantrip is
cast for the duration (six hours).  It can be used to remove fleas and
lice from animals (but not their eggs).

\item[Knot]
Causes two strands to become permanently linked.  The ``knot'' forms a
thicker portion of cord, having the same strength as the composite
stands.  The ends must be placed together, and ten times the diameter
of the cord will be lost from the total length.

\item[Noise]
A ``white'' noise emanates from any point within 20 feet of the
caster.  While this may startle animals, sentients will normally
disregard the sound almost immediately.

\item[Palm]
A small object (up to one ounce) is teleported from the hand to some
other place on the caster's person, or to some place within ten feet.

\item[Perfume]
A pleasant (or slightly unpleasant) scent may be imparted.  Observers
will not notice any particular odour, just that something smells nice
(or bad).

\item[Polish]
This cantrip will remove up to ten square feet of surface corrosion
and tarnish, imparting a pleasing lustre.

\item[Preserve]
Slows the rate of natural decay.  Milk is effectively pasteurised for
example.  However, exposed items will resume decay almost immediately,
and it is advisable to seal the material into airtight jars.

\item[Ravel]
One crack or tear in an object or item of clothing may be extended by
an additional inch in length in one cast (holes may not be created by
this spell).

\item[Repair]
One crack or tear in an object or item of clothing may be seamlessly
repaired.  No more than half a foot length of material may be
repaired in one cast, and edges must be pressed together.  This
cantrip cannot create material (so holes cannot be repaired easily).

\item[Shave]
Removes hair from a person by breaking it at the roots.  Does not affect
hair longer than half an inch and the hair would have to be brushed
from the skin.

\item[Smoke puff] A puff of harmless coloured smoke, ten cubic inches
in size, appears near the caster.  The colour is chosen by the caster
and will ascend and disperse naturally.

\item[Sprout]
This spell causes the sprouting of seeds in up to ten square feet to
accelerate, so that the process takes hours rather than days.  The
seeds must have the proper conditions for germination.

\item[Tarnish]
This cantrip can magically tarnish up to ten square inches of
surface.  This will create at most a very thin film of corrosion and
will not affect material that normally does not corrode.

\item[Tip]
This cantrip causes an object to tip over (the contents, if may, may
spill).  It will not work if the object is fixed in place, or the
total weight is more than half a pound.

\item[Untie]
One knot or tangle can be undone, no matter how tightly knotted.
Magically ``knotted'' cord will not be undone however.

\item[Warm] Up to a pint of liquid, or a pound of solid material, may
be warmed, over a period of a minute, by up to 20 degrees.  It may not
be heated above boiling point, and will immediately begin to cool back
to room temperature.
