\section{College Magic}
\label{college:rituals|(}
\index{rituals!college}

\subsection{Introduction}

This section includes those spells and rituals that are common to all
Colleges.  Note however, that these spells and rituals are still
specific to a College so an Adept can only learn them from another
Adept of the same College.

\subsection{Counterspells}
\label{magic:counterspells}
\index{counterspells}

Counterspells act to increase Magic Resistance and defeat the workings
of other magic. Each college has two of these spells: a General
Knowledge Counterspell, and a Special Knowledge Counterspell. These
are specific to the college --- a Fire College Special Counterspell
will not affect the workings of any Earth College spell, nor would it
affect a General Knowledge spell of the Fire College. Adepts learn
both Counterspells of their own college as part of their General
Knowledge.

\begin{spell}{Counterspell}

\range{25 feet + 25 / Rank} 
\duration{(D10 + 5) minutes  +1 / Rank}
\multiple{\\
100 -- General Knowledge Counterspell \\
200 -- Special Knowledge Counterspell}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity, Object, Area}
\begin{effects}
There are several distinct uses for a Counterspell. They are:
\begin{Enumerate}
\item If cast upon an entity or object the target adds 30 (+ 3 / Rank)
to their Magic Resistance when resisting the type of magic to which
the Counterspell applies.

\item If cast upon an area the Counterspell affects a space 15 feet in
diameter. All targets within the area gain the magic resistance bonus
detailed in \#1 above and additionally no one within the area may cast
a spell of the type affected. A double or triple effect cast may
increase the area of effect to 25 feet or 35 feet respectively.

\item If a Counterspell of the appropriate type is cast over an area
under the effects of a Ward, then that part of the warded area is
temporarily defused. When the duration of the Counterspell ends, the
Ward will become active again.

\item An Adept may use a Counterspell to dissipate a spell that they
have cast. They must direct the Counterspell at the specific spell
effect that they wish to remove. In the case of area effect spells it
is sufficient to cast one Counterspell within the area --- the entire
area need not be covered. One Counterspell will dissipate one spell.

\item Some spells may be removed by any Adept casting the appropriate
Counterspell at them. Only spells that specifically state that they
may be removed this way can be affected. One Counterspell will
dissipate one spell. The Adept must specify the name of the spell to
be removed at the time of casting.
\end{Enumerate}

A target may only be under the effects of the Counterspells of a
single College. The target may also occupy an area under the effects
of another College's Counterspells. Thus the maximum number of
Counterspells that an entity or object may gain benefit from is four:
the General and Special Counterspells of one college cast upon them,
and the General and Special Counterspell of another college upon the
area they occupy.  Counterspells of other colleges cast upon them will
obey the normal rules for stacking. A target may only benefit from one
Counterspell against a particular spell. If there is more than one
appropriate Counterspell protecting a target the highest ranked one
will have an effect.

Characters may learn Counterspells from colleges other than their
own. The Counterspells of other colleges are practised at Rank 0 and
may not be ranked.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[]{Ritual Spell Preparation}
\label{magic:preparation}

For each hour spent in preparation, the Base Chance of the spell is
increased by 3 (up to a maximum of 30 if 10 full hours are spent in
preparation).  If, at any time during the preparation, the Adept's
concentration is broken, the entire process must be restarted from
scratch or abandoned and any time previously spent in preparation is
lost.  An Adept's concentration is always broken if combat occurs
during the ritual.  The Adept may engage in no other activity while
preparing the spell.  The spell must be cast immediately upon
completing the Ritual Preparation.  The Spell Preparation Ritual is a
General Knowledge Ritual.  An Adept cannot achieve Rank with this
Ritual.
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[]{Purification}
\label{college:purfication}
\duration{4 hours + 4 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{MA + WP + 3\% / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\begin{effects}
This purification ritual takes one hour and confers the
following benefits:
\begin{Itemize}
\item 0 (+ 1 / 5 full Ranks) MA.
\item 0 (+ 1 / Rank) Magic Resistance.
\end{Itemize}
The additional MA does not count towards any EP reduction (\eg ranking
general spells or rituals).  This ritual cannot backfire.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[]{The Ward Ritual}
\label{college:ward}
\index{spell storage!ward}

\duration{Until triggered}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{MA + 3\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Volume}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{None}
\actions{Concentration}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
An entity may employ Ritual Magic to set a Ward over an area which
they occupy.

A Ward is a spell which is activated by the entry or exit of objects
or entities into the volume it occupies. Whenever an entity wants to
create a Ward, they engage in one or more hours of Ritual Preparation
to create the Ward.  At the end of the preparation, they check to see
if the Ward is set by making a Cast Check.  If the Cast Check is
successful, the Ward is set. If the Check is not successful, no Ward
exists.

It is possible to backfire from an attempt to create a Ward.  In such
cases, the spell being incorporated into the Ward backfires
immediately. This is rolled for on the backfire table as though a
normal Cast Check had resulted in the backfire.

Once the Ward is cast, the entry or exit of any object or being in the
area occupied by the Ward (determined by the range of the spell
incorporated into the Ward) may trigger the Ward.  The area that the
Ward occupies and the range of the spell incorporated into the Ward
are identical.  This means that most spells (Range 15' + 15 rank) have
a minimum sized ward of 30' diameter (a sphere, centred on the caster,
of 15'radius).  Also, note that many spells have an indefinite range
and hence cannot be incorporated into a Ward.  This includes spells
with ranges of unlimited, self, or touch and spells that can only
affect the adept.  Once a ward has been triggered, it ceases to
exist. It takes full effect on the entity(s) or object(s) that
triggered it, but is dissipated thereafter. It takes full but normal
effect on the target(s) -- there is no possibility for a double or
triple effect (nor for failure or backfire).  Note that a Ward set up
for triggering by an entity or object exiting the area cannot be a
targeted spell, since the target would no longer be within range. The
exiting method of triggering is still useful for area of effect spells
that don't have a specific target.  All Wards emanate from the exact
spot occupied by the individual who cast the Ward (important for
determining range).  Note that there are a couple of spells that can
have an effect beyond their range.

Spells that are not suitable for incorporation into a Ward are those
which require concentration, or some other action by the Adept.  A
Ward always consists of only one spell. More than one Ward may not be
set over a specific area. Any attempt to set a Ward on an area that
overlaps another Ward will fail. The adept will only become aware of
this if they would otherwise have been successful.

Whenever creating a Ward, the Adept must also specify under what
conditions the Ward will be triggered.  They may decide not to limit
its effect, in which case the ward will be triggered by anyone or
anything entering the area over which it is set, or they may limit it
to affecting specific individuals or anything in between.  Thus, an
Adept could set a Ward that would only be triggered by the entry or
exit of a troll. If a multi-target spell is required to hit more than
one target from a Ward, then the trigger must include the number of
beings.  For example, a spell which affects three targets could be set
up to be triggered by three trolls.  The instant that the third troll
entered the volume the Ward would be triggered, but prior to that any
number of lone trolls could have freely moved through the Ward.

A Ward, once it is successfully set, cannot be triggered until the
caster leaves the volume of the Ward.  Specifics of the triggering
mechanism must be something intrinsic to the object or entity (similar
to Detect Aura). Hence a Ward could be set up to be triggered by a
Rank 4 or higher assassin, but could not be constructed to trigger on
the assassin known as Mac the Knife. In order to affect, or exclude,
specific people, those people's Individual True Names may be
incorporated into the Ward, with a sufficiently detailed description
so as to identify the individual. If Individual True Names are
incorporated then there is no possible way to determine what those
names are, but a Divination would reveal the number of people
specifically affected, or excluded.  A Ward cannot recognise a
specific object, but merely an instance of an object.  For example,
``my sword'' could not be included in the triggering mechanism, but a
``magical sword with a yak-hide grip'' could be.  A Ward cannot tell
the time so a Ward cannot include such phrases as ``after x minutes''
or ``at midnight''.  Nor does a Ward have any memory, so in cannot be
set up to be triggered by the third troll to pass.

Once a Ward is set, any entity or object which could trigger the Ward
and which enters the area occupied by the Ward is automatically
subject to whatever spell was woven into the Ward.  Only those spells
known by the caster of the Ward may be woven into the Ward and they
take effect exactly as if the caster of the Ward were present and
casting at the spot occupied by the entity when they set the Ward.
All entities or objects nearby which would normally be affected by the
spell are subject to its effects when it is cast as a result of the
Ward being triggered. Note that for entities or objects to be affected
they must be within the volume that the Ward occupied, with the
exception of those spells which can affect beyond their range.
Targeted spells can only affect what is incorporated in the triggering
mechanism.

Wards are dispelled in one of two ways: either by a Namer casting the
appropriate Counterspell of the same College incorporated into the
Ward, or by being triggered by an entity or object. The Adept who set
the Ward may always counterspell their own spells, and hence they can
dissipate their own wards by casting a counterspell into it.  Wards
exist in perpetuity until dispelled.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[]{The Investment Ritual (Ver 1.1)}
\label{investment}
\index{spell storage!investment}

\multiple{300}
\basechance{MA + 3\% / Rank}
\target{Object}
\casttime{Special}

This ritual allows an Adept to store a spell in an object or scroll.

\begin{Description}
\item[Creation]

The object to be invested must be in a form appropriate to the spell
which it is to contain (\eg Spell of Opening might be invested into
a set of lock picks, or Spell of Enchanting Armour into a set of
armour), and of a size appropriate to the rank and style of that
spell. Please note that a staff engraved with the symbols of the
Adept's college is always considered to be appropriate. The item must
weigh at least one ounce.

An Investment Ritual may not be performed on an object which still
carries charges of invested spells, or a shaped item, or anything made
of cold iron.

The time taken to perform the ritual is one day per charge, unless the
Adept's rank with this ritual is less than the spell rank which they
choose to invest, in which case the investment ritual will take much
longer (spell Rank \x charges) days.  As a ritual which takes an
extended period of time, the rules in \S\ref{magic:extendedrituals}
apply.

The cost of materials used in creating an invested item is [spell Rank
(minimum 1) \x charges \x EM of spell / 2] silver pennies.
These ingredients are consumed progressively during the ritual, with
the last snatch of incense being burned as the success (or otherwise)
of the investment is determined. The Adept may elect to spend more
than this base cost to increase the chance of the success of the
ritual of investment. For every 200 extra silver pennies spent on
materials the base chance of success with this ritual is increased by
1\%.

Alternatively, the Adept may instead opt to prepare a scroll (in a
language in which they have a minimum of Rank 8 literacy). This takes
one day per scroll, and costs only half the usual sum to create.  A
scroll may only ever hold one charge, and weighs only two ounces -
however a scroll case sufficient to protect it from the elements will
weigh much more.

If the Investment ritual backfires, then it is as though the spell
being invested has backfired.

\item[Triggering]
The Base Chance to successfully trigger an invested spell is the cast
chance of the spell at the moment the adept completes the investment
ritual, including all college bonuses, MA, magic, and environmental
conditions. Dice roll modifiers are applied at the moment of
triggering, not investing.

A spell contained in an invested item functions as any pulse-cast
spell, with the usual chance of double and treble effect, and of
backfire.

Any sentient entity may trigger an invested item, if it is physically
possible for them to do so, and if they have been taught how to
trigger it. The adept who created the item, and any adept who has
divinated it, know how to trigger it. Teaching someone how to trigger
an item take 15 minutes.

Triggering always involves speech or a specific motion to target the
item, which may be perceived by a sufficiently alert observer. An
invested item always takes a full five seconds to trigger.

Triggering a prepared scroll takes a full ten seconds and may only be
done by someone literate in the language in which the scroll is
written. The scroll must be read aloud without interruption. No
teaching is required to trigger a scroll.

Any item or scroll loses a charge when it is triggered regardless of
whether or not the triggering is successful.

\item[Limitations]
An invested item may be drained of all magic by a Namer casting the
appropriate counterspell over the item.

If an entity carries more than one hundred charges of invested spells,
these will trigger randomly until under this limit.

An entity's Magic Resistance can be increased by the use of a
counterspell.
d27 1
a27 27
Counterspells act to defeat the workings of other spells cast by
members of the specific college against which the counterspell is
directed.  Each college has a General Knowledge Counterspell and a
Special Knowledge Counterspell.  These are specific to the college --
a Special Fire College counterspell will not affect the workings of a
Special Earth College spell, nor would it affect the workings of a
Fire College General spell.  Adepts learn the counterspells affecting
their college as part of their General Knowledge upon joining the
college.

\textbf{Note:} Counterspells are the only spells of a college other
than their own that an Adept can learn.  They are an exception to
the general rule that one can know only the spells of one's own
college.  Counterspells may be learnt from any Adept of that college
(or a Namer) who is willing to teach it.  As for other spells a
minimum expertise is required in a spell before it may be taught,
equivalent to being of rank 6 or above.  Members of the College of
Namers specialise in counterspells, thus giving them special benefits.
All counterspells of colleges other than that of the character's own
college may only be practised at rank 0 (\ie unranked), unless the
character is a Namer, in which case rank may be achieved.

Counterspells are always General Knowledge spells of the college to
which they pertain, but are considered Special Knowledge spells when
learnt by Adepts of other colleges and as such are affected by the
base chance modifiers of that college.  All counterspells known by
Namers are part of the General Knowledge of that college.

A counterspell may be cast on an entity (including the Adept) or on an
area (a hex and the surrounding six hexes on the Tactical Display).
The entity with the counterspell on, or within an area with a
counterspell on, adds 30 (+ 3 / Rank) to their Magic Resistance, for
the purposes of resisting the type of spell to which the counterspell
applies.

When a counterspell is cast over an area, in addition to the gain in
Magic Resistance, any individual occupying that area may not use a
spell of the type affected by that counterspell until they vacate the
affected area.  This is only an effect of the area counterspells --
counterspells cast on individuals do not inhibit the use of magic by
that individual.  All individuals in the area, or moving into it, add
30 (+ 3 / Rank) to their Magic Resistance until the area is vacated.
A double or triple effect can increase the size of the area (by
increasing the diameter to 25' or 35' respectively) or increase the
duration of the counterspell.

If a being or area were already under the effects of a counterspell
affecting one college, a counterspell affecting another college cast
on them would have no effect.  Rather it will ``queue'', and when the
first counterspell expires the second one will then come into effect.
Thus the maximum number of counterspells able to be protective on an
entity at once is four -- the General and Special Knowledge
Counterspells of one college on the individual, and the Special and
General Knowledge Counterspells of another college on the area in
which the person is standing.  If a higher ranked counterspell of the
same type is cast however, it will ``override'' the original, and the
entity will get the benefit from the higher ranked spell.  An entity
may never benefit from more than one counterspell against a particular
spell, that is if one has the same counterspell on ones person as on
the area currently occupied, only the highest ranked one would have an
effect (although the area spell could still inhibit spell casting).

Wards can be temporarily ``defused'' by the casting of the appropriate
counterspell.  The area-effect counterspell(s) must cover the whole
area of the ward.  When the duration of the counterspell(s) ends the
ward becomes active again (it does not get triggered).
\index{ward!defused}

An Adept may always counter the effect of their own spell by the
appropriate counterspell (unless otherwise specified in the spell
description).  In all other cases only spells specifically so stating
may be removed by any person by the appropriate counterspell -- for
example the Damnum Minatum (G-1 Wicca college), the Curse Spell (G-5
Rune).  For example if an entity with a Damnum Minatum on it has a
Wicca general counterspell cast upon them the spell dispels the last
Damnum Minatum put on.  The counterspell will have no other effect.
Only Namers may remove the effects of other spells, by means of the
Ritual of Dissipation (\S \ref{namer:dissipation}).  Counterspells as
used by practitioners of the College of Naming Incantations have some
additional powers -- see the college description for more details.

When an Adept attempts to remove a spell effect using a counterspell,
they must direct the counterspell at the specific spell effect.  If
there are multiple instances of a spell effect acting on the target (
for example when spell effects are queued) then the Adept can nominate
which instance to counter.  In the case of area effect spells, the
Adept just has to place an area counterspell within the area of the
spell.  It need not cover the entire area of the spell.  In general,
this will only apply to Namers with Dissipation, but items and special
abilities may be affected.

Note that counterspells are resistible when cast at an entity, so
unless the entity is deliberately not resisting they must attempt to
resist the spell.

{\em Duration:} (D10 + Rank) \x hours spent purifying \\
{\em Experience Multiple:} 200 \\
{\em Time Taken:} 1, 2 or 3 hours \\
An Adept may increase their Magic Resistance by 5 and their Magical
Aptitude by 1 for each hour spent in Ritual Purification.

Ritual Purification always increases both Magic Resistance and Magical
Aptitude by the aforementioned amounts for each hour spent in
purification up to a maximum of 3 hours (for a total increase of 15 to
Magic Resistance and 3 to Magical Aptitude). An Adept can only be
under the influence of one Ritual Purification at a given time.  The
effects of the purification last for a number of hours equal to (Rank
with Ritual Purification + D10) \x the number of hours spent in
purification.  The die is always rolled by the GM who keeps the result
secret until it is time to inform the players that the result of a
purification has worn off.  The ritual is always interrupted by the
necessity of suspending the Adventure Sequence and employing the
Tactical Procedure and must be abandoned or restarted from scratch
with all hours spent in purification being lost.  However, once a
Ritual Purification has been completed, the Adept can enter combat and
employ all of the benefits of the purification.  An Adept must
announce when they start a purification the number of hours they will
spend engaged in the ritual.  They may engage in no other activity
(including moving, resting, or employing other special preparations)
while engaged in this ritual.  Ritual Purification is a General
Knowledge Ritual.

     Investment Ritual - Ver 0.3


   Summary of changes discussed at
the meeting

1) Weight restriction redesigned.
2) Time taken to invest altered -
now significantly quicker for those
more proficient with the ritual
than the invested spell,
significantly slower for the
incompetent
3) Fatigue cost to trigger removed
entirely
4) Scrolls clarified - cheaper
investment cost trades off with
slower to trigger (GMs to enforce
actual time required to "prepare" a
scroll from a scrollcase on their
own discretion).
5) Exemption for the adept's own
investeds from the charges >100 =
kablooie rule removed
