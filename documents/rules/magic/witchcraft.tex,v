@\begin{college}[1.1]{witchcraft}{Witchcraft}{WI}

The College of Witchcraft is concerned with natural magics, the
rhythms of the world, and especially with blessings and curses.
Practitioners of the College of Witchcraft are commonly known as Witches
if female, Warlocks if male, or collectively as Wicca.  This College
is without doubt the most primitive and least formal in its approach
to magic.  The Wicca generally feel themselves to be more in tune with
the world than the various Elemental Colleges, who dedicate themselves
to only part of the whole, and certainly more than the Thaumaturgists
who practise a sterile and scientific magic.  The widespread use of
Witchcraft predates the present renaissance of magic on Alusia and
Wicca are much more often found practising their trade in small towns
and villages than in cities.  Novice Wicca will usually have been
apprenticed to a local Witch or Warlock rather than having attended
any form of Magical Academy.

The College's magic touches on alchemy, herbalism and astrology, and
many Wicca possess some of these skills.  The other Colleges often
treat Wicca with a degree of contempt as they view this dabbling with
``quasi-magic'' to be less than worthwhile.  This is not to say that
the Wicca are without power, as experienced Adepts of Witchcraft have
available to them powerful magics, fully the equal of any other
College.  In these destructive and powerful magics there lies danger
however, and some Wicca become so obsessed with the ``darker'' side of
natural magic that they begin to follow the Dark Path of magic and
make agreements with the Powers of Darkness so as to further their
material goals.  These Adepts are often known as ``Black Mages'' and
are greatly feared.  Many ``Black Mages'' view the other members of
the College as weak or foolish for failing to exploit the powers they
possess.  At the other extreme, some Wicca follow a path of
pacifism, and eschew the curses and destructive side of Witchcraft.
These Adepts are sometimes referred to as ``White Mages'' or ``White
Witches'', in contrast to their darker brethren.  Most Wicca view both
of these extremes as unfortunate deviances from the College's holistic
path.  Many of the Agents of the Powers are Wicca as the College's
general and undivided outlook does not conflict often with a Power's
interests.

Being highly in tune with magic as a whole, Wicca are more sensitive
to changes in the ``mana flow'' than other Colleges.  The Wicca's
magic is somewhat affected by the presence of large amounts of spirit
such as from proximity to many entities, or from a lessening of the
``mana flow'', such as on the certain ``mana poor'' days of the year,
which have universally become known as ``High Holidays'' of the
Elohim, the spirit Powers.  Conversely, a Wicca's powers increase when
away from sources of spirit and on certain ``magic rich'' days,
sometimes referred to as ``Faerie days''.  Finally, due to the ancient
nature of the College and the equally ancient association between the
elements of light and spirit, a Wicca's powers are slightly decreased
during the hours of daylight, whether the Wicca is in light or not,
and are slightly enhanced during the hours of darkness.

\subsubsection{Traditional Colours}

Wicca usually wear clothing in the colours of nature itself, in much
the same way as the Elemental mages, but often in combination that the
Elementals do not use.  Blues and greens reminiscent of sky and sea
are worn with the light browns of the earth, and with the warm golds
and oranges of autumn or fire.  ``Black Mages'' traditionally cloak
themselves in midnight robes sometimes embroidered with pentagrams and
other Daemon associated symbols, whilst ``White Mages'' often wear
robes of bleached or unbleached wool or linen.

\subsubsection{Traditional Symbols}

Animals are most commonly associated with the Wicca as many Adepts of
this College keep animal familiars with cats, ravens, toads and owls
being the most usual.  There is only one symbol that is often
connected with the Wicca, the Great Wheel of Being, representing light
and darkness, earth and air, water and fire, spirit and mana.  This
symbol sometimes appears as an eight pointed star or eight arrows
radiating from a central point, and at other times as two circles
passing through each other at right angles, or even simply, as two
intersecting circles.  Black Mages often use and wear Daemonic
symbols, but very seldom use the Great Wheel.  White Wicca seldom use
any symbols, but when they do, the Great Wheel is the most common.


\subsection{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Witchcraft may practice their arts without
restriction.

The MA requirement for this College is 18.

\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}

The Base Chance of performing any talent, spell or ritual of this
College is modified by the addition of the following numbers:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
From sunrise to sunset				& -5 \\
From sunset to sunrise				& +5 \\
In large town or city (pop. greater than 2000) & -5 \\
In small town or village (pop. 500 to 2000)	& +0 \\
In hamlet or rural (pop. less than 500)		& +5 \\
Mana poor day					& -5 \\
Mana rich (Faerie) day				& +5 \\
In a high mana area				& +5 \\
In a low mana area				& -5 \\
\end{tabularx}

All modifiers are cumulative.  Those modifiers pertaining to sunrise
and sunset are applied depending on the hour of day, and not on
whether the Wicca is standing in light or darkness.  A Wiccan
underground with no light during the day still receives the negative
modifier.  Modifiers pertaining to population, refer to the population
of sentient beings, within 1 mile of the Wicca.

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Farsensing}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Active concentration}
\multiple{150}
\target{Familiar}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can, by remaining stationary and actively concentrating for
the duration of the talent's workings, see, hear, taste, smell and
feel the same things as their familiar, provided that their familiar
is within 15 feet (+ 15 feet / Rank) of their position.  This talent
allows no special communication with the familiar, merely the ability
to utilise their senses.  The Adept must have already acquired a
familiar through the use of Finding Familiar Ritual (Q-1) for this
talent to be effective.  It takes about 10 seconds (- 1 / Rank) for
the Adept to tune in to the familiar's senses.  If the familiar is
killed while the Adept is using this talent the magical backlash is
harsher, due to the tighter link, and the amount of magical damage
incurred is increased by 5 points, see Q-1.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Special Alchemy}
\index{alchemy!witchcraft special alchemy}
\begin{effects}
The Adept gains certain knowledge of Alchemy.  The specific benefits
accruing to the Adept are:

\begin{Description}
\item[Distilling Venoms]
The ability to distill venoms from such plants as belladonna.  The
Adept functions as a Rank 1 Alchemist for this purpose.  See the
Alchemist Skill.

\item[Distilling Toad's Sweat]
The ability to distill a dose of a potion of Toad Sweat that will
remove blemishes, warts, corns, pimples, etc., at the rate of 1
disfigurement (wart, corn, etc.) (+ 1 / Rank) per dose.  The
Experience Multiple for this potion is 100 and its cost is 50 Silver
Pennies.  The Base Chance of effectively preparing it is 60\% (+ 2 /
Rank).

\item[Making Amulets]
The ability to make the following amulets:

\item[Amethyst]
Wards bad dreams and assists the wearer in achieving a restful sleep.
Increases the wearer's Fatigue recovery during sleep periods by 10\%
(round down).  Cost: 3000 SP.

\item[Aquilegius]
The wearer subtracts 10 from all rolls on the Fright Table.  Cost:
2400 SP.

\item[Beryl]
Increases the wearer's ability to detect traps and ambushes by 5.
Cost: 4000 SP.

\item[Betony]
Decreases the Base Chance of infection by 15. Cost: 2200 SP.

\item[Bloodstone]
Prevents miscarriage and decreases Base Chance of infection by 20.
Cost: 3000 SP.

\item[Carbuncle]
Decreases damage done by poison by 2 points of damage per pulse or
day. Cost: 9600 SP.

\item[Chalcedony]
No undead will willingly approach closer than 10 feet to the wearer in
most cases. Cost: 4800 SP.

\item[Diamonds]
Increases all of the wearer's Strike Chances by 2. Cost: 8000 SP.

\item[Elder Flowers]
Makes the wearer proof against the Evil Eye. Cost: 400 SP.

\item[Hypericum]
Increases the wearer's Magical Resistance by 10 to any magical act
performed by a Demon or Daemonic being.  Cost: 800 SP.

\item[Iron]
No Demon or Daemonic being will willingly approach closer than 10 feet
to the wearer in most cases. Cost: 4000 SP.

\item[Jade]
No undead will willingly approach closer than 30 feet to the wearer in
most cases. Cost: 4000 SP.

\item[Jet]
No Demon or Daemonic being will willingly approach closer than
50 feet to the wearer in most cases. Cost: 4800 SP.

\item[Luck]
Made from tiger's or alligator's teeth.  It increases the wearer's
Magical Resistance by 3 and adds 2 to the wearer's defense. Cost: 2400
SP.
\end{Description}

Note that the ``cost'' is the cost of material necessary to manufacture
the amulet.  Each amulet requires 3 days to manufacture once the
necessary materials have been gathered or purchased.  Amulets are
usually sold at (cost + 25\%).  The time taken to prepare an Amulet is
full-time work, and no training may be undertaken at the same time.
Those Amulets that prevent the ``willing approach'' of certain
creatures, create a ``circle of protection'' around the wearer.  The
creatures protected against will not willingly cross the circle's
boundary, but if forced across it, for instance by the approach of the
wearer, are no longer inconvenienced by the protection.

\begin{Description}
\item[Love Philtre]
The ability to distill from a variety of substances a Love Philtre
which will cause the imbiber to fall in love with the first entity
upon whom he or she sets eyes after drinking it (regardless of species
or sex).  The Base Chance to prepare the Philtre is 30\% (+ 3 / Rank)
and the Experience Multiple is 200.  The cost of the materials will
average 600 silver pieces.  The effects of the substance will last for
1 week (+ 1 week / Rank), unless dispelled by the casting of the
General Knowledge Counterspell of the College of Witchcraft by the
creator of the Love Philtre, or by the successful use of the Curse
Removal Ritual. In the latter case, the curse is treated as Minor.

\item[Fertility / Infertility Potion] The ability to distill from a
variety of substances a Potion of Fertility or Infertility that
increases or decreases the chances of conception by 5\% (+ 5 / Rank).
It has a 30\% (+ 3 / Rank) chance of working and may be passively
resisted by the imbiber.  The effects of the Potion of Fertility last
1 day (+1 per 3 or fraction Ranks) whilst that of the Potion of
Infertility last 1 week (+1 per 3 or fraction Ranks), unless dispelled
by the casting of the General Knowledge Counterspell of the College of
Witchcraft by the creator of the Potion or a Ritual of Remove Curse is
employed.  If the latter option is taken, the curse is considered a
Minor Curse.  The Experience Multiple for this potion is 200 and its
cost is 100 Silver Pennies.  The Base Chance of conception for races
may be found under the Conception in Character Generation.  A roll for
conception should not be made more than once in 48 hours.
\end{Description}
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-3]{Witchsight}
\index{witchsight!witchcraft}
\multiple{200}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may see objects or entities which are invisible and they
appear to have a slight blue sheen around them. If the invisibility
effect (excluding Walking Unseen) is of a higher Rank than the
Witchsight, the object or entity may not be clearly identified or
directly magically targeted. The Adept may also see in the dark as a
Human does on a cloudy day, with an effective range of vision of 150
feet under the open sky, and 75 feet elsewhere.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Damnum Minatum}
\index{curse!damnum minatum}
\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept curses any one target within range with a particular
unpleasantness as listed below. Some of the effects are identical to
backfire results; such effects are cross referenced to the backfire
table (\S\ref{tables:backfire}).  If the effects of the curse are
doubled or tripled, the Adept may inflict 2 or 3 different results.
The curse is permanent until a General Knowledge Counterspell of the
College of Witchcraft is cast over the afflicted entity, a Ritual of
Remove Curse is employed, the duration expires, or the effect is cured
by a healer of the appropriate Rank.  Curses that have a duration, or
may be cured by a Healer are indicated in their descriptions. If a
Ritual of Remove Curse is employed, the Damnum Minatum is considered a
Minor Curse.  A separate Counterspell or Ritual of Remove Curse must
be used on each separate curse.  Identical Damnum Minatum effects are
not cumulative.  Note that the Adept may always choose to inflict a
curse of lesser Rank than their actual Rank.  The Curses that the
Adept may inflict are dependent on the Rank of the spell:

\begin{Description}
\item[Rank] \textbf{Curse}
\item[0--3] Boils 1 (+ l / Rank); Warts 1 (+1 / Rank).
\item[4--6] Clumsiness (-l AG); Maladroitness (-l MD).
\item[7--9] Weakness (-2 PS); Poor health (-3 EN).
\item[10--11] Cowardice (-3 WP \& +5 Fright/Awe rolls); Lose Smell \& Taste (B:73).
\item[12--13] Deafness (B:67); Lose Tactile Sense (B:75); Virulent Skin Disease (B:79-80).
\item[14--15] Insomnia (B:77); Wasting Disease (B:81); Periodic Hallucinations (B:88).
\item[16--17] Periodic Muscle Spasms (B:82-83); Asthma (B:93); Migranes (B:86-87).
\item[18--19] Creeping Senility (B:94-95); Struck Mute (B:71); Arthritis (B:89-90); Enfeeblement (B:91-92).
\item[20] Blindness (B:63); Amnesia [Roll D10]: \\
\hspace*{2em} 1--2 Partial - Magic (B:96) \\
\hspace*{2em} 3--5 Partial - Skills (B:97) \\
\hspace*{2em} 6--7 Partial - Recent (B:98) \\
\hspace*{2em} 8--10 Total (B:99). \\
\end{Description}
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Darkness}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{15 minutes + 15 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{60\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a volume in which non-magical light is partially
suppressed. The volume will be 1000 (+ 500 / Rank) cubic feet, and may
be in any one contiguous area the Adept desires, provided that no
dimension is smaller than one foot. The entire volume must be visible
and within range at time of casting, and may not be moved. For
visibility purposes, the Spell will increase Darkness levels within
the volume to 60\% + 2\% / Rank. Rank 20 Darkness may not be seen
through. It will not aid in providing bonuses for casting purposes,
though it will neutralise penalties due to natural light, to a maximum
of 5\% + 1\% / Rank. The volume counts as direct shadow for Star \&
Shadow Mages. If the lighting conditions are lower than that provided
by the spell, no effect will be apparent. Note that because light is
only being suppressed, it may still pass through, and no shadows are
generated outside the volume. If it is possible to see through a
Darkness, everything beyond it is normally visible.  This spell can
engender silhouettes of lit objects against the darkness, though not
create shadows. Any of this volume may be overridden by a higher
ranked Spell of Light, or neutralised (back to original conditions) by
an equal rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Decay}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cause an amount of food, produce or beverage to quickly
age, moulder, spoil and rot.  Upon casting the spell the targeted
matter will decay, causing parasitic fungi to spring forth, and an
odour of decay to prevail.  The spell may ruin up to 1 cubic foot of
food and drink (+ 1 cubic foot / Rank).  If a double or triple effect
is achieved the amount of food that is spoiled may be doubled or
trebled.  Once affected by the spell the food and drink will
thereafter be inedible.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Fear}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept instills in the target an uncontrollable fear.  Unless the
target successfully resists they must roll on the Fright Table.  If a
double effect is achieved, the Adept may choose to modify the Fright
Table roll up or down by an amount equal to the rank of the spell.  If
a triple effect is achieved the Adept may modify the Fright Table roll
by twice the rank of the spell.  See the Fright Table for the exact
results of the Fear.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Harming Entity}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 second + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Unless successfully resisted, the Adept causes the target intense
pain for the duration of the spell.  The target must check to see if
their concentration is broken and must subtract 10 (+ 3 / Rank) from
their Strike Chances whilst suffering the pain.  The difficulty
multiplier for the Concentration Check is dependent on the Rank of the
spell:

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\textbf{Rank}  & \textbf{Multiplier} \\
0--5	& 3.0 \\
6--10	& 2.5 \\
11--15	& 2.0 \\
16--19	& 1.0 \\
20	& 0.5 \\
\end{tabular}

No actual damage is inflicted as a result of this spell.  Note that
Mind Mages will be somewhat unaffected by this spell, and may halve
the reduction to their Strike Chances.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Hypnotism}

\range{15 feet}
\duration{Concentration: maximum 5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may lull an entity that is within range into a trance-like
state in which they will be subject to suggestion. The spell may not be
cast over a totally hostile entity.  Once the subject has been
hypnotised, the Adept may make suggestions (provided that they can
communicate verbally with the subject) that will be readily accepted
unless they directly conflict with the subject's best interests. The
subject will remain suggestible so long as the Adept maintains
concentration and the subject remains in range.  The subject will
continue to implement implanted suggestions for 3 hours (+ 3 / Rank)
after the suggestions have been made, even when no longer hypnotised.
The subject will never have any idea where the suggestion that it is
implementing came from.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Igniting Flammables}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may call forth fire and cause flammable material (cloth,
paper wood, and similar items, but not flesh) to burst into flames.
The material will thereafter burn normally and the flames may be
extinguished by normal means.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Mind Cloak}

\range{Self}
\duration{1 hour + 2 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a cloak around their own mind so that their thoughts
cannot be detected or read.  This spell does not prevent the Adept's
presence or emotions from being detected, but their mind will simply
not appear to be there when an attempt is made to ``read'' it.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9]{Protection Against Were-Creatures}

\range{15 feet}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The spell creates an invisible Circle of Protection with a radius of
15 feet (+ 1 / Rank) which will not willingly be crossed by any
Were-creature or Shapechanger in beast form unless they successfully
resist the circle's effects upon first encountering it.  Even if the
Circle's effects are resisted, the Were-creature or Shapechanger will
be discomforted while within the Circle, and will have their Strike
Chances reduced by 10.  If the circle is seen with the use of
Witchsight, it will appear as a glowing red circle, similar to a ring
of fire.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-10]{Storm Calling}

\range{Works at any range}
\duration{60 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Special}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon any storm front which may exist anywhere in
sight.  Upon reaching the spot occupied by the Adept at the time of
casting, the storm front will slow and finally cease moving and begin
a downpour (snow, rain, hail, sleet, or whatever else that the GM
feels the clouds may contain). Generally a storm front can be seen for
20 to 30 miles.  If no front can be seen the spell may still be cast,
but the Base Chance is reduced by 20.  The storm front will take [D \x
3 - 1 / Rank] minutes to arrive.  Once the duration has expired, the
weather will gradually return to normal over a similar amount of time.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-11]{Summoning Enchanted Creatures}

\range{5 miles + 1 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon 1 enchanted fantastical creature (+ 1 per 5 or
fraction Ranks).  Only creatures that are native to the area may be
summoned.  It will take them D10 minutes (- 15 seconds / Rank), minimum
1 minute, to arrive and they will be uncontrolled when they do arrive.
If more than 1 creature is summoned, all must be of the same type.

\resist{None}
\storage{Potion, Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not invisible.  This
means that it will not transmit light.  As a consequence the target
will cast a shadow, which may or may not be noticed, depending on the
lighting conditions, etc, and will have a reflection in a mirror or
other reflective surface.  However, the target may not be noticed even
if another entity is looking directly at them.  An entity will get a
Perception check to notice the target if the target becomes invasive
on the entity's senses (\eg standing next to the entity and putting
their hands over the entity's eyes).  Note that a Crystal of Vision or
similar means of viewing is considered direct viewing and is affected
by this spell.  If the target, or the target's possessions, are
touched by another entity, or an entity's possessions, then the spell
is broken.  Although not truly invisible, the target may be detected
by using magical means to detect invisible entities (\eg Witchsight).

\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to create a wind over an open space of up to 100
feet (+ 100 / Rank) in diameter, centred upon themself.  Outside of
this area the wind will fade back to the prevailing wind over half
again the distance.  The wind will build up over [D - 2] minutes and
the Adept must choose before that time which direction the wind will
blow.  The speed of the wind is determined by a D100 roll as follows:

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\textbf{Dice}	& \textbf{Velocity} \\
01--10	& 35 mph \\
11--25	& 15 mph \\
26--50	& 10 mph \\
51--75	& 25 mph \\
76--90	& 35 mph \\
91--100	& 45 mph \\
\end{tabular}

The Adept may add or subtract a number equal to the Rank of the spell
from the dice roll used to determine velocity.  This need not be done
until after the dice have been rolled and the result ascertained. If a
double or triple effect is achieved the Adept may add or subtract
double or treble the Rank of the spell.  If the resulting wind is over
30 mph missile fire will be affected, reducing Base Chances by the
(wind speed / 2) but extending ranges by a similar number of hexes if
firing with the wind, or reducing them respectively if firing into the
wind.

\resist{None}
\target{Animal}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{A piece of food acceptable to the type of animal being summoned}
\actions{Concentration}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may attempt to summon a small animal that will serve them as
a familiar.  The type of animal is chosen by the Adept and may be any
natural, unenchanted, small animal such as a cat, dog, bat, rat, toad,
weasel, falcon, owl, goat, monkey, trout, etc, and must be native to
the area in which the summoning is performed.  If the summoning is
successful, an animal of the chosen sort will arrive at the Adept's
location in (25 - Rank) minutes.  The ritual allows the Adept to
communicate with the animal when it first arrives.  The Adept must
promise to feed and protect the animal.  The GM should roll a reaction
check for the animal.  If the result is Enraged, the animal attacks,
if Belligerent it leaves immediately.  If neither of these results are
achieved, the animal agrees to serve the Adept as a familiar.
Regardless of the result, the Ritual confers no further ability to
communicate with the animal.  If the Adept fails to feed the familiar
on a regular basis, or mistreats it in any way, the familiar may run
away, and a new familiar must be found.  The familiar will serve the
Adept to the best of its ability, warning them of danger, and so
forth.  If the Adept is unable to communicate with the familiar
magically it will attempt to warn them by tugging at their cloak,
whimpering, or whatever, as appropriate.  If the familiar is killed,
the Adept suffers [D + 5] points of damage in the form of a magical
backlash.  This damage may not be resisted.  An Adept may only have
one familiar at any one time.  A familiar is not an enchanted
creature.  The range of the summoning caused by this ritual is 1 mile
(+1 / Rank).

\resist{Special}
\target{Special}
\casttime{30 minutes}
\material{78 card Tarot deck}
\actions{Laying out \& reading Tarot cards}
\concentration{None}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may read the tarot to gain insight and information.  The
Tarot may be used in one of four ways, and only one of these four
options may be chosen per reading.  Once one of these options has been
successfully implemented, a new reading must be begun in order to
implement another.  There is no Backfire except as specifically noted.
The four options are:

\begin{Description}
\item[Divining Aspects]
The Adept may use the Tarot to attempt to divine the Aspect or Aspects
of an entity that is present for the entire ritual and within 5 feet
(+1 / Rank) The entity may actively but not passively resist the
reading.  The Base Chance of the reading is 40\% and if successful,
the Tarot will tell the Adept the entity's basic Aspect (autumn air,
lunar, death, etc), and whether the entity is light or dark aspected.
Failure will result in no sensible answer and Backfire in an incorrect
reading.

\item[Divining Enchantment]
The Adept may use the Tarot to attempt to determine if an entity or
object is currently, or had been recently, under the effects of a
spell.  The object or entity must be present for the entire duration
of the ritual, and be within 5 feet (+ 1 / Rank).  The ritual may not
be resisted.  The Base Chance of the ritual being successful is 45\%.
The Base Chance is reduced by 5 for every week or part thereof since
the spell that is being divined was cast.  Permanent magic (\eg invested
items still with charges) or spells currently in effect carry
no modifier.  The Adept gains knowledge of those spells that fall
within their cast chance.

If the Adept can divine the spell, its exact name and college are
revealed.  If the spell is non-colleged in origin, its general effects
are revealed.

\item[Divining the Future]
The Adept may use the Tarot to attempt to learn something about future
events.  The Adept must decide on a question to be posed or a general
course of action being considered before attempting this divination.
The GM may make the reading as simple or as complex as they desire,
but in all cases the information gained should be vague.

The Base Chance of successfully Divining the Future is 20\%.  If the
Adept fails this option, the reading will be gibberish and obviously a
failure, but if a Backfire occurs, a sensible but otherwise false,
reading will be gained.

\item[Questioning the Dead]
The Adept may attempt to communicate with the spirit of a deceased
entity provided that they occupy the place that the entity died or was
buried.  The Adept may only attempt this if they are aware that the
place they occupy was the site of the entity's death or burial.  The
Base Chance of the spirit responding to the Adept's questioning is
10\%.  If the spirit responds the Adept may ask it questions and
interpret its answers by turning over cards.  Only questions that can
be answered with yes or no should be asked, and the spirit's answer is
indicated by the orientation of the card turned.  The dead can only
provide knowledge of events that transpired while they were alive.
Once the dead initially respond they will continue to answer all
questions until dismissed, or the entire deck has been used.

will be proof against locusts, droughts, flooding, frost, and other
natural disasters.  This spell will also dissipate the effects of a
Spell of Blighting Crops which has previously been cast on the target
area of this spell.

\begin{effects}
The Adept may mar or bless any unborn child whose mother is in sight
while she is pregnant.  The Adept may increase or decrease any one
characteristic of the child by 1 (+ 1 per 3 or fraction Ranks).  This
spell may only be cast on the same unborn child more than once if it
is cast by different Adepts, and is used on different characteristics.
The spell may raise characteristics above normal racial maximums.  If
cast so as to curse, it is a Major Curse and may only be removed
before the child is born.  Note that if this spell is made into a
potion, the target of the spell is the imbiber.  The imbiber may only
passively resist the effects of the potion's magic.

\begin{effects}
The spell may be cast on up to 5 (+ 1 / Rank) livestock that are
within sight.  These animals will then be resistant to natural
disorders, such as rabies, dysentery, worms, and hoof and mouth
disease for the duration of the spell.  This spell will also dissipate
the effects of a Spell of Pestilence which has previously been cast on
the targets of the spell.
\end{effects}

\begin{effects}
The spell causes 1 acre + 1 / Rank of land within sight to become sour
and lose fertility.  There is a 20\% (+ 1 / Rank ) chance of future
crops failing while this spell is in effect.  Those years that the
crops do not fail, they will be stunted and approximately half a
normal yield will be obtained.  This spell is a minor curse.  This
spell will also dissipate the effects of a Spell of Blessing Crops
which has previously been cast on the target area of this spell.
\end{effects}

\begin{effects}
The Adept causes the target to develop vision similar to that of a
cat.  Everything will appear monochromatic (\ie shades of grey) and
it is difficult to accurately estimate distance.  The higher the
Rank, the less of a problem this will be.  Some amount of light must
be present for this vision to operate.  The range of the vision is 50
feet (+ 10 / Rank).

\begin{effects}
The Adept controls the actions of one normal and unenchanted animal,
bird or aquatic, that does not successfully resist.  The creature will
serve the Adept as long as they maintain their concentration.  If the
Adept chooses to release the animal or has their concentration
broken, the creature may attack them or flee. The chance to cast this
spell is reduced by 5 if the Adept cannot Communicate with the
creature.  If the Adept cannot make eye contact, the Base Chance is
also reduced by 5.
\end{effects}

\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may communicate with any natural and unenchanted, animal,
bird, or aquatic.  Whether this communication is verbal or symbolic,
and to what extent the communication may be carried is left up to the
GM's discretion.  The Adept must specify at the time of casting what
particular type of animal, bird or aquatic is to be conversed
with. The spell must be re-cast to speak to another type of animal,
bird, or aquatic.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Creating Plague}

The spell infects any one target with any of the following diseases:

\begin{tabular}{cl}
\textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Disease} \\
0--5	& Measles \\
6--10	& Consumption \\
11--15	& Typhoid \\
16--18	& Bubonic Plague \\
19--20	& Pneumonic Plague \\
\end{tabular}

The target will not die of the disease, but will become habitually ill
and all who come in contact with them (except the Adept who cast the
spell) may contract a potentially fatal dose of the disease.  In
effect, the target becomes a carrier. This spell is a major curse.
Note that if this spell is made into a potion, the target of the spell
is the imbiber.  The imbiber may only passively resist the effects of
the potion's magic.
\end{effects}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}

\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Water}
\begin{effects}
The spell creates out of drinkable water a potion which, when imbibed,
subtracts 2 from Endurance and repairs 4 lost Fatigue.  The amount
subtracted from Endurance is increased by 1 and the amount of Fatigue
repaired is increased by 2 per Rank.  The fatigue so restored may have
been lost through damage or tiredness, including spell casting.  The
potion will only restore lost Fatigue.  This spell can be prepared in
two ways:
\begin{Enumerate}
\item
The Adept can turn water into a restorative potion that will last 2
minutes (+2 / rank).
\item
The Adept may spend an hour and burn oils costing 500sp to make a
potion with the same effects that will last indefinitely.
\end{Enumerate}
The effects of drinking the potion may be resisted.  The Endurance
damage caused by this potion may be healed by normal means.
\end{effects}

\duration{Special}
\multiple{600}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Damnum Magnatum is a Major Curse and may take one of three forms,
as chosen by the Adept.  The Damnum Magnatum may normally only be
removed by the use of a Remove Curse Ritual, by a Counterspell cast by
the Adept that laid the curse, or by the death of the target.  This
spell may not be dissipated.

\begin{Description}
\item[Affliction]
The Adept may choose to torment or kill their target.  If the effects
of the Affliction are intended to be deadly, the target may not die as
a result of the curse before (24 - Rank) hours have passed.  The
Adept's player states what the Affliction is to do, and then the exact
effects and results must be decided by the GM.  In addition to the
normal ways of lifting a curse, afflictions may have durations or
conditions worded into them, in which case the curse is lifted when
the duration expires or the condition is met.  Players should note
that Afflictions are particularly capricious, and can never be relied
upon to operate in precisely the same manner twice.  Some sample
Afflictions are:
\begin{Enumerate}
\item
Target begins to age at 10 years per day.  Target may die of old age.
Once the curse is lifted the target will age backwards to their
correct age, at the same rate.

\item
Target contracts a deadly disease (including open running sores) that
may not be cured by the arts of a Healer.

\item  
Target is transformed into a frog or other small creature (but retain
their own mind).  Condition: the Curse may be lifted by the kiss of a
member of royalty of the opposite gender.

\item
Target is cursed with Lycanthropy (random species).

\item
 Target will fall into a century long sleep (see Hibernation, College
of Air Magics).
\end{Enumerate}

\item[Ill Luck]
Add two times the Rank of the Adept with this spell to any percentile
dice roll involving the target's use of their abilities.  This may
never be applied favourably.  Note that this is an addition to the
dice roll, not a subtraction from Base Chances.

\item[Doom]
A Doom is a pronouncement, by the Adept, upon an event that will occur
in the target's future, such as: ``You will die by the hand of a loved
one.''  The statement, which must be indefinite, will come true in not
less than (24 - Rank) weeks.  The Doom remains until it is fulfilled,
and may not be removed by a Remove Curse Ritual, or even by the death
of the target, unless that death fulfils the Doom.  The target is
immediately aware of the nature of the Doom, and its wording.  A Doom
may be modified, so as to decrease the severity, make the time factor
longer, etc., by the casting of a modified Doom on the same target, by
an Adept with Rank in this spell at least equal to the Rank at which
the original Doom was cast.  The exact effects of the Doom must be
decided by the GM, and players should note that two Dooms, even if
worded the same, need not have precisely the same effects.

\begin{effects}
By the use of this spell the Adept causes the very earth to pitch and
roll uncontrollably as though in a tremendous earthquake.  The area
that may be affected is a one hex area of ground (+ 1 / Rank).  Any
Entities within the Area must roll less than or equal to 1 \x AG to
retain their footing.  Those who fail to remain standing fall prone
immediately and may not rise for the duration of the tremor.  Objects
within the Area will tend to topple and roll around.  If the spell is
cast under part of, or all of, a building, wall, or other such
construction, significant structural damage will occur, probably
causing partial or total collapse.

\begin{effects}
By use of this spell, the Adept curses the target with ill-fortune.
Unless the target resists, all their Base Chances, Strike Chances, and
their Magic Resistance are reduced by the Rank of the spell (1 if

This sulphurous fire attacks 1 human-sized target for every 3 (or
fraction) Ranks. The target's Magical Resistance is reduced by 5 (+ 1

target successfully resists, they suffer only half damage (round up).
Double damage add an additional 1 / Rank damage and triple damage adds
an additional 2 / Rank damage.

\storage{None}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell enables the Adept to instil a possession of up to 5 lbs (+5
/ Rank) with the power of flight. The spell will dissipate if the
object stops being a possession of the Adept, the Adept loses
concentration, or if the object is broken. The Adept may cause the
object to fly at 20 miles per hour (+ 2 / Rank). It will take off and
accelerate up to full speed, or halt and land, in a single pulse. The
object may support 150 lbs (+ 50 / Rank) in addition to its own
weight. Naturally flexible or fragile items gain sufficient strength
and rigidity to support the load. Any object or entity that falls from
the flying object will move off in a random direction. If the object
is about to crash into a surface, it will attempt to land, although
some surfaces may be inappropriate for this (lava, sheer walls, etc.).

The spell may be cast on up to 5 (+ 1 / Rank) livestock that are
within sight.  All livestock so cursed that do not resist
(individually) are infected (see \S\ref{adventure:infection}).  Any
new stock which comes into contact with the infected stock while the
curse is in effect must also resist (individually) or become infected.
This spell is a minor curse on each individual.  This spell will also
dissipate the effects of a Spell of Blessing Livestock which has
previously been cast on the targets of this spell.

\begin{effects}
The Adept may enchant an animal pelt or skin so that anyone who
touches, or is touched by the ``inside'' will turn into the type of
animal to whom the pelt originally belonged, but will retain their own
mind and memories.  The spell is, in effect, stored in the pelt or
skin, and may be retained unused for an length of time dependent upon
the Rank of the spell:

\begin{tabular}{cl}
\textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Duration} \\
0--6	& 1 week (+ 1 / Rank) \\
7--12	& 2 weeks (+ 2 / Rank) \\
13--19	& 1 month (+ 1 / Rank) \\
20	& permanent until used \\
\end{tabular}

The wearer of the pelt may only resume their own form by having the
Special Knowledge Counterspell of the College of Witchcraft cast over
them.  The pelt is destroyed by the process of returning the wearer to
their original form.  This spell may be used to enchant the pelts or
skins of sentient entities, but if used for that purpose its Base
Chance is reduced by 20\%.  Note that if a backfire result is achieved
when casting this spell, the pelt or skin is destroyed in addition to
any other backfire effects.  The Skin Change spell itself may be
stored by Investment (so that it may later be triggered on a pelt)
but not by other means.  The ``inside'' of a pelt is the side that was
closest to the animal's body.

The skin must be applied to the target for at least 30 seconds before
they will change, where upon the target gets to resist its effects.

\begin{effects}
The Adept causes a wall of tangled briars and thorns to spring forth
from the ground.  The wall is 10 feet high \x 20 feet long \x 2 feet
thick.  The Adept may increase the length or height by 1 foot per
Rank.  The wall may not be cast on top of an entity.  A human-sized
hole may be made in the wall by causing 20 points of damage in one
area.  This damage need not come from a single attack.  All ``A''
class weapons and most ``C'' class will have little effect on the
tough springy vines.  An entity forcibly pressed against the wall, or
attempting to force their way through it will suffer [D + 2] damage
for every Pulse they are so engaged.  This damage is entirely
physical, and armour may protect against it.  An entity can normally
force its way through the wall in 6 Pulses.  The wall is very dense,

The Adept may change one or more of the three components that make up
the weather by performing a ritual dance.  The three components of
weather are: Precipitation / Cloud Cover, Temperature, and Wind.  The
GM should consult the Weather Table and advise the player of the
current level of each of the three components before they start
dancing.  The Adept may change one component by Rank / 2 (round down),
or two components by Rank / 3 (round down) levels each, or all three
components by Rank / 4 (round down) levels each.  The changes are
independent and may be in any direction.  The weather will change
gradually over 30 minutes (- l / Rank) per level shifted, and all
three components will change simultaneously.  The area of the effect
is circular and the diameter is 2 miles / Rank (minimum 2).  This

\begin{effects}
The Adept creates 13 Rune-bones by carving the appropriate
maledictions into bones from an entity of the same race as the target.
The Adept then buries the bones beneath the dwelling of the entity
that they wish to curse. It is best if the victim's name is carved in
the bones as well.  If the intended victim's name is not carved on the
bones, and there are 1 or more other entities inhabiting the dwelling,
there is a 20\% (- 1 per Rank) chance that the curse will settle on
someone other than the intended victim.  For each month that the bones
remain in or under the victim's dwelling, they must make a Resistance
Check, the Base Chance for which is composed of the victim's Endurance
multiplied by the Difficulty Multiplier of the resistance.  The
Difficulty Ratings are:

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Multiplier} \\
0--5	& 4.0 \\
6--10	& 3.0 \\
11--15	& 2.5 \\
16--18	& 2.0 \\
19--20	& 1.5 \\
\end{tabular}

If the victim fails to resist, they suffer a wasting disease and lose
[D - 4] Endurance for purposes of future resistance (only).  If they
fail to resist for three straight months they die.

\begin{effects}
By means of this ritual the Adept creates an horrific and evil candle.
Only the darkest of the Wicca would ever perform this Ritual.  The
Adept makes a Dead Man's candle by severing the left hand of a
convicted murderer who has been hung.  The hand must be severed during
a full moon and wrapped in a burial shroud.  It must then be dried in
the sun until desiccated.  The Adept must render the fats and oils
from the body of a stillborn baby, so that the hand can be coated with
them and a candle made.  The wick of the candle is then made from the
hair of the same murderer.  The Adept says words of darkest power over
the candle.  Thereafter, it may be lit as part of any spell or ritual
of this College and will increase the chance that the spell or ritual
is successful by 20, provided that the ritual is being performed with
malign intent.  This Ritual may not be Ranked, and it always works, if
it is correctly performed.  A Dead Man's Candle will burn for about 10
hours before it is no longer usable, and may be extinguished and relit
an indefinite number of times.

\begin{effects}
This gruesome ritual creates an amulet of great and malign potency.
 Many Wicca consider this ritual to be evil and it would certainly
 never be studied or performed by a ``White Mage''.  To successfully
 perform the ritual, the Adept must sever the right hand of a
 convicted murderer who has been hung.  The hand may only be severed
 during the new moon and must be wrapped in a winding sheet.  It must
 then be dried in the sun and the blood entirely removed.  When the
 desiccated hand is worn as an amulet, thereafter, it will subtract 10
 from the Cast Check of creating any Plague, Blight, or Curse.  This
 Ritual may not be Ranked, and it always works if it is correctly
 performed.

The ability to distill from a variety of substances a Potion of
Fertility or Infertility that increases or decreases the chances of
conception by 5\% (+ 5 / Rank).  It has a 30\% (+ 3 / Rank) chance of
working and may be passively resisted by the imbiber.  The effects of
the Potion of Fertility last 1 day (+1 per 3 or fraction Ranks) whilst
that of the Potion of Infertility last 1 week (+1 per 3 or fraction
Ranks), unless dispelled by the casting of the General Knowledge
Counterspell of the College of Witchcraft by the creator of the Potion
or a Ritual of Remove Curse is employed.  If the latter option is
taken, the curse is considered a Minor Curse.  The Experience Multiple
for this potion is 200 and its cost is 100 Silver Pennies.  The Base
Chance of conception for races may be found in the bestiary.  A roll
for conception should not be made more than once in 48 hours.

The Adept has a Base Chance equal to their Perception (+ 5 / Rank) of
seeing objects which are normally invisible or which have been
rendered invisible by magical means (\ie such spells as Walking
Unseen, Blending, and Invisibility).  The Adept may also see in the
dark as a Human does on a cloudy day, with an effective range of
vision of 150 feet, under the open sky, and 75 feet elsewhere.

effect, along with those cast one to four weeks ago, but not five or
longer.}

{\small \textbf{Example} If, for instance, the Adept and companions
were considering entering a ruined castle,that the GM had determined

The Adept causes one human-sized target for every 3 (or fraction of 3)
Ranks they have in this spell, to become wreathed in invisible fire.
The target's Magic Resistance against this spell is reduced by 20.
The fire causes [D + 1] (+ 2 / Rank) damage.  If a target successfully
resists they suffer only half damage (round up).  If the flames are
viewed (\eg by Witchsight) they will be seen to be smoky and
sulphurous.

\sItem{Target}{Object}
\emph{Effect:}
The Adept instills one object with the power of flight.  The object
may not be larger than 2 cubic feet (+ 2 / Rank) in volume.  The Adept
may cause the object to fly, provided that they remain in contact with
it, and maintain passive concentration.  If the Adept's contact with
the object, or their concentration is broken, the spell dissipates and
must be recast to once more be effective.  The spell will also
dissipate if the object is destroyed.  Parts of the object that are
broken off will not possess the power of flight.  Whilst the spell is
in effect the Adept may cause the object to fly at up to 20 miles per
hour (+ 2 mph / Rank).  The spell will support the object and up to
150 lbs (+ 50 / Rank) in weight.  It must be noted that it is the
object and not the Adept that is flying, and that this will limit the
usability of some objects.  Example of objects that are particularly
useful for this spell are rugs, tables and four poster beds, whilst
some of those of dubious worth are swords, rings, and bracelets.
Broomsticks or boats are recommended only for the experienced flyer.
Because all parts of the affected object are flying equally, naturally
flexible objects, such as carpets, gain sufficient rigidity to support
riders.

purposes, though it will reduce penalties due to natural light by up
to 5\% + 1\% / Rank.  If the lighting conditions are lower than that
provided by the spell, no effect will be apparent. Note that because
light is only being suppressed, it may still pass through, and no
shadows are generated. If it is possible to see through a Darkness,
all beyond it is perfectly visible. This spell can engender
silhouettes of lit objects against the darkness, though not create
shadows.  Any of this volume may be overridden by a higher ranked
Spell of Light, or neutralised (back to original conditions) by an
equal rank.
