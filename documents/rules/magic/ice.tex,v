@\begin{college}[1.5]{ice}{Ice Magics}{IC}

The College of Ice Magics is concerned with the shaping of ice and
snow, freezing and the manipulation of cold.

Ice Mages have been most valuable to those fragile communities living
in cold, arid and often dangerous places, where food is hard to grow
and neighbours can be separated by days of travel.  Many of the Ice
Mages' Spells and Rituals are designed either to enhance living in
these inhospitable areas or to aid hunting and defending themselves
from arctic predators.  Ice Mages are seldom seen in warm climates,
and have been unpopular with Philosophers of magic who cannot agree
whether to place Cold as an element in its own right.  The College of
Ice Magics has been likened to the Colleges of Water, due to its
connections with Ice and Snow, Fire, as an antithesis, Air, due to its
weather-like effects and Mind, due to the peculiar mental fortitude
its Adepts have demonstrated while living in cold climes.

\subsubsection{Philosophy}

Ice Mages tend to be of a solitary and quiet nature, often having
lived their lives isolated in areas of sparse population density.
Many are hunters or only part-time Mages.  They generally have fair
relations with most Colleges, but relations with the Fire and Water
Colleges are distinctly icy.

\subsubsection{Traditional Colours}

Ice Mages are not known to dress flamboyantly.  Whites and Greys are
popular colours when dressing in warmer climes, perhaps with a hint of
pale blue.  However in their own element they usually wear undyed
leathers and furs.

\subsubsection{Notes}

All the Ice and Snow generated by the spells of this college is Real
unless otherwise specified.  It is in no way magical, and does not
have a duration.  External effects (\eg heat) will begin to affect it
immediately upon its generation.

Ice Magics is considered ``opposite'' to Fire Magics.  Many Ice spells
and effects are uniquely vulnerable to the spells of the Fire College,
and to Fire.  Additionally Ice Magics have some spells and effects
that are especially effective versus Fire and Fire creatures.  This in
no way affects the ``opposite'' relationship that the Colleges of Water
and Fire Magics have to each other.  Water Magics and Ice Magics are
not considered related; rather they are generally regarded as
anatgonistic rivals.

\subsection{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Ice Magics may practise their arts without
restriction.

The MA requirement for this College is 13.

\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}
\label{ice:modifiers}
All base chances of Ice Mages are affected by temperature. Only one of
the temperature modifiers may be applied at one time.  Consult the
Weather Scale Table for Weather Gauge details.

\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\textbf{Temp.}	&\textbf{Gauge}&\textbf{Temp} \textdegree C&\textbf{Mod.} \\
Very Cold	&	0 - 3	& <= - 5	&	+ 10 \\
Cold		&	4 - 5	& <= 5		&	+ 5 \\
Average		&	6 - 8	& 6 - 24	&	+ 0 \\
Hot		&	9 - 10	& >= 25		&	- 5 \\
Very Hot	&	11 +	& >= 35		&	- 10 \\
\end{tabular}

If the Adept is standing on Ice or Snow in an area where it is in
abundance they gain an additional +5\%.

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Cold Affinity}

\multiple{100}
\begin{effects}
This talent allows the Adept to ignore the deleterious effects of low
body temperature.  The adept is treated as if having a Resist Cold
spell of equal Rank to the Rank in this talent in effect at all
times. Should the Adept also be under the effect of a Resist Cold
spell, the higher of the two ranks is in effect.

\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Endure Hardship}

\multiple{150}
\begin{effects}
This talent allows the Adept to function capably even in harsh and
forbidding environments.  The Adept may go without food (but not
water!) for 1 (+1 / Rank) days every three months with no ill effects.
These days may be taken singly or consecutively, and the Adept need
not consume extra food later to make up for this time spent fasting.
The Adept may additionally increase the Base Chance of any
concentration checks made in hostile environments, when the
concentration checks are reduced below 4 \x WP due to environmental
effects, by 1 \x WP / 5 full Ranks the Adept has in this talent, up to
a maximum of 4 \x WP.  Finally, the Adept may reduce high fatigue
rates due to environmental and weather effects, other than those
relating to heat or fire, by a 1 row shift per 10 full ranks the Adept
has in this talent on the Rate of Exercise Chart (see
\S\ref{tables:encumbrance}, under the Fatigue and Encumbrance Chart),
down to a minimum rate of medium fatigue, or light fatigue at rank 20.
For example, at Rank 10 a Strenuous climb up a mountain may be treated
as if it is only a Hard climb.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Extinguish Fires}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
This spell extinguishes all fires within a chosen 5 foot (+ 5 / Rank)
diameter sphere, all of which must be within the spells range, by
smothering them with ice crystals.  Magical fires are not
affected. This spell is identical to the Fire College ``Extinguish Fire
Spell'', except that the effect is achieved by physical means (this is
merely a cosmetic difference).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Freeze}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 day + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{50}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may freeze one object of up to 5 lb. (+ 5 / Rank). This
freezing will protect the object from decay while the duration
lasts. While frozen the object will be as cold as ice to the touch and
will drip slightly from condensation. When the duration has expired
the object will defrost at the rate of 1 minute per pound of weight.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Ice Creation}

\range{15 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates a film of ice 1 inch thick in a single square of
dimensions 1 (+ 1 / Rank) foot each side or a single cube of ice of
dimensions 6 (+ 6 / Rank) inches cubed.  The ice must be created on
the ground and not on top of an entity.  It is non-magical and will
persist until melted, etc.

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Ice Traversal}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{20 minutes + 20 / Rank}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell enables 1 target (+ 1 / 4 full Ranks) to travel over ice
and/or snow without slipping or sinking in, as if it were normal earth
and/or rock.  For example, this would enable climbers to climb icy
slopes.  Quadrapeds are treated as two targets for the purposes of
this spell.  In addition, if the terrain travelled on is flat ice,
each target's TMR is increased by 1 (+ 1 / 3 full Ranks) while on the
ice.  See Travel on Ice (\ref{ice:travel}), for additional detail.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Refrigeration}

\range{25 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{50}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The caster may cause the ambient temperature of one 15 \x 15 \x 15
foot cube to lower by 2\textdegree C / Rank. Note that this spell is
the Ice Mage counterpart to the Fire Mage Spell of Temperature
Alteration (G-2).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Resist Cold}

\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell protects the target from the effects of cold temperature by
increasing the Gauge by 1 (+ 1 / 4 full Ranks) up to a maximum of
Gauge 7 (Comfortable). It will totally protect the target from the
effects of Hypothermia at Rank 11+. In addition, the target suffers 1
(+ 1 / 4 or fraction Ranks) less damage due to magical or non-magical
cold based attacks. This spell is identical to the special knowledge
Air college spell of the same name.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Snow Shovel}

\range{Self}
\duration{Concentration: maximum of 15 minutes + 15 / Rank}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
This spell enables the Adept to clear a path along snow or ice
obstructed ground and/or to tunnel through snow and ice.  Any snow or
ice up to 2 feet in front of the Adept undergoes a change in density
to dry snow, and is pushed to either side, leaving a gap 2 feet wider,
and higher (if applicable), than the size of the Adept.  No more than
1 hex (+ 1 / 2 full Ranks), may be cleared per pulse in this manner.
This effect moves with the Adept.  The Adept may lean in order to
direct the path up or down.  Note that the walls and roof of a tunnel
through snow or ice are merely packed snow and do not confer any
particular structural support or stability.  See Travel on or through
Snow (\ref{ice:travel:snow}) for additional detail.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Water to Ice}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume of Water}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can freeze up to 10 (+ 10 / Rank) cubic feet of existing
water based liquids into solid ice, or into snow of a density chosen
by the Adept. All the water to be transformed must be within the
Adept's range at the time of casting. This spell may not be cast on or
near entities or their possessions.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Create Igloo}

\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{MA + 4\% / Rank}
\begin{effects}
The Adept must spend one hour in ritual construction of a miniature
dome made out of snow or ice cubes. At the end of this time the Adept
must make a successful cast check. If successful, the dome swells in
size to become an igloo of internal size 5 (+ 1 / Rank) feet radius
and 2 feet thick.  This ritual cannot backfire.  The Igloo has a
single entrance which is chosen by the Adept to be up to half its
internal height in both height and length. The inside temperature of
the igloo always counts as very cold (-10 degrees) and the following
enchantments apply to objects or entities while they remain inside the
igloo:
\begin{Itemize}
\item All entities and creatures are treated as having a resist cold
spell upon them of equal rank to that of the Adepts Rank in this
ritual
\item All organic objects are preserved from decay
\end{Itemize}
In addition the igloo counts as bound snow while the duration is in
effect and will not melt or break due to non-magical forces (although
magical attacks affect it as normal).  Once the duration runs out the
igloo reverts to a normal (non-magical) igloo and will thereafter
melt, collapse etc. as normal due to external conditions.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-2]{Bind Ice and Snow}

\duration{Concentration: Maximum 1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{750}
\basechance{MA + 4\% / Rank}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may bind all of the ice and snow within a 5 (+ 5 / Rank)
feet radius circle of the Adept. The results of this ritual are
similar to those for the binding of other elements.  The Adept gains
control of all of the facets of the element.  The Adept may move or
shape the ice and snow, change its consistency and instil intelligence
in it as desired.  Finally, the Adept may sacrifice a point of MA
(this may be bought back with EP) in order to make a part or all of
the bound ice and snow permanently bound.  In this instance, the bound
ice and snow is non-intelligent but magical, and is enduring.  Almost
no magical or physical force will affect it (\eg it resists Wizard's
Eye and Telepathy), with the exception of magical heat and fire,
against which it has 100 times the resistance of ordinary ice and
snow, and if any part of it remains it will (slowly) regenerate.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Armour of Ice}

\range{Touch}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell is covered by a magical Armour of Ice, which
provides 5 points of Armour Protection (+ 1 / 4 full Ranks) which
fluctuates according to the current temperature: the Armour gains +2
points of Armour Protection when the temperature is very cold, +1 when
its cold, -1 when its hot, and -2 when its very hot (see
\ref{ice:modifiers}).  The armour has a weight rating of 5 (see
\ref{tables:armour}) and subtracts 2 from AG and 20 from stealth.  Ice
Armour may not be cast on entities wearing armour.  This spell will
stack with other defensive spells.  The Ice Armour is vulnerable to
Fire, and has an ablative effect; it will absorb up to half of any
fire damage taken, but for every 10 points of damage taken (before
halving) one point of protection is removed from the armour, and if
the protection is reduced to zero the spell is immediately dissipated.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Icy Transformation}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{One (metal or mineral) Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell turns one metal or mineral object of up to 5 lbs (+ 5 /
Rank) entirely into ice (a wall of iron would have to be entirely
turned to ice but a single brick in a wall could be transformed).  The
object is then transparent and vulnerable to damage, heat etc. At the
end of the duration, the object will revert back, but any damage will
not be repaired.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Freezing Wind}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{5 seconds + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{225}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
This spell causes Arctic conditions to prevail in a 10 (+ 1 / Rank)
feet cube. Any entity within this cube which fails to resist will
suffer [D - 4] (+ 1 / 2 full Ranks) points of magical cold damage per
pulse. Creatures of fire (efreet, salamander or elemental) take half
damage even if they resist.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Frostbite}

\range{50 feet + 25 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Special}
\begin{effects}
This spell may either be used to kill (5 \x [Rank])\% of all
non-sentient plants within the Adepts range, or the Adept may target
and kill 1 individual plant (+ 1 / Rank).  There is no visible effect,
but death due to frostbite occurs at the time of casting and no amount
of non-magical effort will revive plants affected by this spell.
Sentient plants take 1 (+ 1 / Rank) points of damage (instead of
dying), and may passively resist for no damage.  Other plants that are
magical or especially resistant to cold may also be entitled to a
passive resistance roll versus the spell's effects.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Frozen Doom}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell uses magical cold to freeze solid the blood of one target
entity, which may be up to 1 hex (+ 1 / 2 full Ranks) in size, killing
it instantly if they fail to resist.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Hibernation}

\range{5 feet}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell is placed in suspended animation for up to
([Rank \x Rank]) days as specified by the Adept.  At Rank 20 there is
no maximum and the Adept may choose any duration.  All bodily
functions including ageing, are suspended for the duration of the
spell and the target feels cool to the touch. The target is immune to
cold and suffocation, and takes no more damage from existing injuries
while this spell is in effect.  Additional injuries will still affect
the target, but any damage that would occur due to bleeding, poison
etc. is ignored. When the spell duration runs out, or the spell is
dispelled, the target awakens with physical strength reduced by 1 /
full week hibernated and immediately begins to suffer from any
existing injuries and conditions (poison, disease, shock, bleeding and
suchlike). Physical strength may be regained at a rate of 1 point per
day, and is not reduced below 1. Entities that naturally hibernate
suffer -20 to their Magic Resistance vs. this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Ice Bolt}

\range{20 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity, Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a 2 foot long, 2 inch diameter non-magical bolt of
ice which is projected at a target with a Strike chance of 30\% (+ 3 /
Rank) + MD, modified by range as if it were a heavy crossbow. The ice
bolt strikes as an A class weapon doing [D + 4] (+ 1 / Rank) damage
which can stun and inflict specific grievous injuries. Once the spell
is cast the target gets no magic resistance, but the target's defence
is subtracted from the chance to hit, since the effect of the spell is
to create a physical bolt.  A double or triple effect cannot affect
damage but may add +10\% and +20\% to the Strike Chance respectively.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Ice Construction}

\range{15 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{225}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may conjure 30 (+ 30 / Rank) cubic feet ice in up to 1 +
Rank shapes of the Adept's choice.  The shapes always appear entirely
within the range of the Adept and may not appear above or inside
(partially or wholly) any entity.  Each shape must appear on the
ground in a stable fashion (not about to topple over) and must have a
minimum thickness of 6 inches in any part.  When the spell duration
expires, the ice disappears (returns to whence it came).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Iceberg}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: Maximum 30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area of Water}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a polyhedral iceberg of dimensions 10 (+ 2 / Rank)
feet cubed.  It may only be successfully created in an existing volume
of liquid sufficient to hold it without it touching the bottom. 8/9 of
the Iceberg will be submerged. The Iceberg will be flat topped and may
stably support up to 1 hex of entities (+ 1 / Rank) (Additional
entities will cause it to roll in the water).  While the Adept is in
contract with the Iceberg the Adept may move the Iceberg at a speed of
5 (+ 1 / Rank ) miles per hour. The Iceberg spell also has a calming
effect on the water around it, reducing the size of all waves up to
Rank feet away by Rank feet.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Ice Pack}

\range{10 feet +5 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell immediately halts any damage being taken due to shock or
blood loss and the target gains 1 / Rank to their chance of recovering
from stun or unconsciousness (if applicable). It will restore a (live)
character on negative endurance to zero, although any further damage
will start the process of shock and bleeding as usual. In addition, if
the target is suffering from the adverse effects of a fright roll or
similar emotional effect, they get a second roll (in some cases a
second resistance roll) to recover from (``or snap out of'') it with
+1\% / Rank added to their dice roll. The cause of the fright or shock
may have been magical or otherwise. This spell may be recast on each
target as often as desired. This spell will not work on regenerating
entities (including those under the effects of a trollskin spell).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Ice Projectiles}

\range{20 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{1 Entity + 1 / Rank}
\begin{effects}
Each entity targeted by this spell must resist or suffer [D - 4] (+ 1
/ Rank) points of magical damage due to being pierced by flying A
class shards of ice (armour does absorb damage but there is no AG
loss). If this spell is doubled the adept may not double damage but
may choose to have the ice projectiles ignore armour instead. If this
spell is tripled, the adept may roll for a possible A class specific
grievous injury for each target that failed to resist, in addition to
ignoring armour as above (and still doing fatigue damage except as
part of the grievous result), or reduce the targets' resistances as
usual.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-12]{Ray of Cold}

\range{30 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity, Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell projects a blast of intense magical cold at the target. The
ray of cold will impact either on the target or on the first
obstruction blocking the path from the Adept to the target.  Anything
struck by the ray must either resist or suffer [D + 1] (+ 1 / Rank)
damage (resist for half damage).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-13]{Snowball}

\range{10 feet +10 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: Maximum of 10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Adept, Special (chosen each pulse)}
\begin{effects}
This spell causes the ground within 5' of the Adept to be instantly
covered with 5 inches of conjured snow (returns to whence it came when
the spell duration expires).  Snowballs then form themselves out of
the snow and launch themselves at a target or targets of the Adepts
choice. Up to 1 target (+ 1 / 4 full Ranks) can be pelted with a
flurry of snowballs each pulse. A different set of targets may be
chosen by the Adept each pulse.  Each target must resist or suffer a
reduction of -1\% (- 1 / 2 full Ranks) to their Base Chance of doing
anything while being snowballed and in addition must make a 4 \x WP
roll (3 \x WP if Adept is above Rank 10 in this spell) to perform any
action that involves concentrating (\eg casting a spell). Each target
need only resist this spell once. If the Adept leaves the 5' diameter
circle of snow while this spell is in effect, the spell is
automatically dissipated.

\duration{10 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell causes snow to begin gently falling in an area of between 5
feet minimum and 40 feet (+ 5 / Rank) maximum diameter (chosen by the
adept).  The snow will form in the air at between 10 and 40 feet above
the ground, and will gently float to the ground.  The area within this
spell, if above zero degrees in temperature, will be magically cooled
to zero degrees for the spell duration (nb. This will not count as a
positive modifier to Ice mage base chances as it is magical, although
it may reduce negative modifiers to zero).  For each 5 minutes that
this spell is in effect, one inch of powder will cover the ground.  At
the end of the spell the snow will remain, but the temperature will be
restored to normal (and the snow may begin melting).  Note that if
this spell is, for example, cast inside a house with a 20 foot
ceiling, as the snow is formed in the air between 10 and 40 feet up,
only a third of the snow will fall in the room.  The other two thirds
will appear above the 20 foot line and will fall on the roof, with the
exception of a small amount that appears in the attic.

\begin{effects}
This spell conjures a wall of ice that is 10' high, 20' long and 2'
thick, or a pillar 15' high with a 3' diameter.  The adept may choose
to increase the height of the wall by 1', the width by 2' or the
thickness by 6", or the height or diameter of the pillar by 1', for
each Rank the Adept possesses in the spell.  The wall may be uniformly
curved up to a half circle. The wall may not be created on top of an
entity, and is subject to the usual restrictions on physical walls.
The wall is translucent but not transparent.  When the spell duration
expires the ice returns to whence it came.

\subsection{Special Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[R-1]{Snow Simulacrum}

\duration{Concentration: Maximum 1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{MA + 3\% / Rank}
\resist{Special}
\begin{effects}
The Adept spends an hour forming a human or animal figure, no larger
than 1 hex (+ 1 / 3 full Ranks) in size, out of snow, which must be
already present. The animated sculpture will have the same
characteristics as the sculptured entity, except that all
characteristics are reduced by 25\%. This will generally cause
abilities to be lessened by a like amount (\eg Flying speed is reduced
by 25\% (if the entity can fly) due to Agility being reduced; Damage
from attacks is reduced by 25\% due to Strength reduction, Base Chance
to hit is reduced because of M.D. reduction, etc.).  Magical abilities
are not copied in the copied form, although quasi-magical abilities
may be.  The simulacrum will not bear a close resemblance to any other
figure unless the figure chosen to be duplicated is present during the
ritual. In the latter instance the figure being duplicated may choose
to actively resist the ritual; otherwise the ritual is
non-resistible. The simulacrum has only animal intelligence, and the
Adept may give it simple instructions or actively concentrate to
control its movements (requires the Adept to perform pass actions).
The simulacrum will have vague inclinations relating to its original
(borrowed) form, and although no longer comprised of snow (it takes on
a fleshy appearance, or whatever is appropriate for the original
entity) will have an adverse reaction to the presence of heat and
flame and will take an additional 2 points from heat and flame
attacks. The simulacrum normally resembles a generic example of its
borrowed form except that it has a snowy sheen to it and is cool to
the touch. Clothes, possessions and suchlike are not duplicated by
this ritual. When the Adepts concentration ceases, the simulacrum will
collapse into a pile of ordinary non-magical snow.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-2]{Summoning and Controlling Ice Elemental}

\duration{Concentration: Maximum 1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{MA + 5\% / Rank}
\begin{effects}
The Adept summons an Ice Elemental from its home plane (conjectured to
be the elemental plane of Cold), which will appear within 20
feet. This ritual takes 2 hours, and may only be performed in
temperatures of 0 degrees or less. If the ritual backfires the
Elemental arrives uncontrolled and will attack the Adept (and others
nearby); however if the ritual is successful the Elemental is
controlled and must obey the Adept's every whim. The Elemental remains
until dispelled, which the Adept may do by successfully casting a
Special Knowledge counterspell at it. 1\% is added to the base chance
of success on this ritual for each point of Willpower the Adept has
over 15. Ice Elementals are similar to other Elementals in that they
do not normally exist on this plane, but are summoned by Ice
magics. They will always be hostile to their summoner and will attack
if uncontrolled. Ice Elementals are impervious to attacks with
non-magical weapons. Magic does affect them. Ice Elementals are
vulnerable to fire and can be damaged by attacks involving this
``opposite element''. Ice Elementals have a combined endurance and
fatigue of 15 (+ 6 / Rank), which must be divided in such a way that
they fall into the ranges indicated below. Any reference to Rank below
refers to the Adept's Rank in this ritual.

Ice Elementals have the following characteristics :
\begin{Description}
\item[Habitat] Other Planes
\item[Frequency] Very Rare
\item[Number] 1
\item[Description] Ice Elemental appear as lean crystalline humanoids
with frosty hair and silvery blue eyes. They are half as tall, in
feet, as their Endurance.

\item[Talents, Skills and Magic] Ice Elementals can disappear into Ice
with only a 10\% chance of being detected. They can freeze water
within line of sight at a rate of one cubic foot per pulse for every
point of Physical strength available to the Elemental (entities within
the area get a 3 \x AG check to avoid being caught and trapped while
Ice forms around them), and they can cast a Ice construction and Wall
of Ice at a Rank equal to their summoner's Rank + 4 in this ritual.
These are talents and cost no fatigue. They may expend 2 fatigue to
fire an Ice bolt (as per the Spell) striking as an A class weapon with
a base chance equal to the Elemental's combined maximum Endurance and
Fatigue, and doing [D + 4] (+ 1 / Rank) points of damage. Since this
is a physical attack formed from the Ice Elemental, the Ice bolt
remains after firing.

\item[Movement Rates] Running 200 + 10 \x Summoner's Rank
\end{Description}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{PS:} 20 + 5 / Rank	& \textbf{WP:} 14 - 18 \\
\textbf{MD:} 20 - 25		& \textbf{EN:} 5 - 50 \\

\item[Weapons] Ice Elementals strike their opponents with open hands
and pierce them with their long icy fingers. They can attack twice in
the same pulse without penalty doing [D + 3] (+ 1 / Rank) damage per
strike.

\begin{ritual}[R-3]{Ritual of Winter}

\duration{ Concentration: Maximum 1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{MA + 3\% / Rank}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may change one or more of the three components which make up
the weather by performing a ritual dance. The three components of
weather are;

\begin{Enumerate}
\item Precipitation, Degree
\item Temperature, Gauge
\item Wind, Force
\end{Enumerate}

The GM should consult the weather table and advise the player of the
current level of these three components before the Adept starts
performing the ritual. The Adept may change the current components by
1 (+ 1 / 2 full Ranks). All the changes may be in any direction on the
table with the proviso that the Adept may never raise the temperature,
and must lower it by at least one degree. All weather within 2 miles
(+ 2 / Rank) of the Adept is affected by the ritual. This ritual
cannot backfire.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{The Element of Ice}

\subsubsection{Ice}

Ice weighs 47.2 lb.\ per cubic foot and is translucent (but not
transparent).

\subsubsection{Breaking through Ice}

This applies particularly to the spells Ice Creation, Ice Construction
and Wall of Ice, but may also be used in natural settings (for example
a single inch of ice may cover a lake).

Ice is deemed to have 10 points of fatigue per inch, 120 points per
foot.  It takes only half damage from being hit by B class weapons,
full damage from axes, fire and water based attacks, and double damage
from picks (note that for fire based attacks bonuses against cold
creatures apply, for those spells that have them).  Other weapons only
do a single point.  Endurance blows do double damage.  The exception
is when a blow by any weapon exceeds the remaining fatigue of the ice;
in this case all damage is applied (the ice breaks).  Successful
elimination of the ice's fatigue makes a human sized hole in the ice,
big enough for a one hex entity to go through.  Multiple entities may
attempt to break through the same area of ice, within reason.  Smaller
holes may be made but for the purposes of simplicity are no quicker to
make (when digging far into the ice at least a human sized hole must
be made in order to keep working anyway).

\subsubsection{Travel on Ice}
\label{ice:travel}

Bipeds must travel at half TMR (round up) while on ice or make a 2 \x
AG roll each pulse or go prone. Quadrupeds may make a 4 \x AG roll to
travel at full speed, or go prone.  Subtract 1 \x AG if the ice is
wet.  Entities going prone may also slide up to half their TMR along
the ice in the pulse in which they fell, depending on how much of
their movement was in one direction (GM's discretion).

\subsubsection{Travel on or through Snow}
\label{ice:travel:snow}

Travel through snow usually causes entities to lose 1/4 of their TMR
per foot of powder, down to a minimum TMR of 1 (unless the powder is
higher than the entity is tall).  In addition there is an encumbrance
shift of one column on the encumbrance table for each 1/4 TMR slowed.
Note the reference to powder - if the snow is denser than freshly
fallen powder the effects may be less.  These figures are based on a
human sized entity; a giant (for example) would only suffer the
effects of 4 foot of powder (TMR reduced to 1) when up to its chest;
that is, in about 13 feet for a Stone Giant (normally 20 feet tall).
Quadrupeds tend to manage snowy conditions well, and should be treated
as if they were standing erect for the purposes of height calculation.
Hobbits, and other creatures with large feet, may have these penalties
halved at the GM's discretion.  GM's may also allow items such as snow
shoes; a suggestion is a straight halving of TMR but the entity does
not sink into the snow.  Note that such items are not known or common
in warmer climes!

travel over ice and/or snow without slipping or sinking in, as if it
were normal earth and/or rock.  For example, this would enable
climbers to climb icy slopes.  Quadrapeds are treated as two targets
for the purposes of this spell.  In addition, if the terrain travelled

\begin{effects} This spell enables the Adept to clear a path along snow
or ice obstructed ground and/or to tunnel through snow and ice.  Any
snow or ice up to 2 feet in front of the Adept undergoes a change in
density to dry snow, and is pushed to either side, leaving a gap 2
feet wider, and higher (if applicable), than the size of the Adept.
No more than 1 hex (+1 / 2 full Ranks), may be cleared per pulse in
this manner.  This effect moves with the Adept.  The Adept may lean in
order to direct the path up or down.  Note that the walls and roof of
a tunnel through snow or ice are merely packed snow and do not confer
any particular structural support or stability.  See Travel on or

Ranks) which fluctuates according to the current temperature: the
Armour gains +2 points of Armour Protection when the temperature is

magical cold damage per pulse. Creatures of fire (efreet, salamander
or elemental) take half damage even if they resist.

d399 10

\begin{effects} This spell may either be used to kill (5 \x Rank)\%
(min. 5) of all non-sentient plants within the Adepts range, or the
Adept may target and kill 1 individual plant (+ 1 / Rank).  There is
no visible effect, but death due to frostbite occurs at the time of
casting and no amount of non-magical effort will revive plants
affected by this spell.  Sentient plants take 1 (+ 1 / Rank) points of
damage (instead of dying), and may passively resist for no damage.
Other plants that are magical or especially resistant to cold may also
be entitled to a passive resistance roll versus the spell's effects.

\begin{effects} The target of this spell is placed in suspended
animation for up to (Rank \x Rank) days (minimum 1) as specified by
the Adept.  At Rank 20 there is no maximum and the Adept may choose
any duration.  All bodily functions including ageing, are suspended
for the duration of the spell and the target feels cool to the
touch. The target is immune to cold and suffocation, and takes no more
damage from existing injuries while this spell is in effect.
Additional injuries will still affect the target, but any damage that
would occur due to bleeding, poison etc. is ignored. When the spell
duration runs out, or the spell is dispelled, the target awakens with
physical strength reduced by 1 / full week hibernated and immediately
begins to suffer from any existing injuries and conditions (poison,
disease, shock, bleeding and suchlike). Physical strength may be
regained at a rate of 1 point per day, and is not reduced below
1. Entities that naturally hibernate suffer -20 to their Magic
Resistance vs. this spell.

\begin{effects} The Adept creates a 2 foot long, 2 inch diameter
non-magical bolt of ice which is projected at a target with a Strike
chance of 30\% (+ 3 / Rank) + MD, modified by range as if it were a
heavy crossbow. The ice bolt strikes as an A class weapon doing D + 4
(+ 1 / Rank) damage which can stun and inflict specific grievous
injuries. Once the spell is cast the target gets no magic resistance,
but the target's defence is subtracted from the chance to hit, since
the effect of the spell is to create a physical bolt.  A double or
triple effect cannot affect damage but may add +10\% and +20\% to the
Strike Chance respectively.

entirely within the range of the Adept and may not appear above or
inside (partially or wholly) any entity.  Each shape must appear on
the ground in a stable fashion (not about to topple over) and must
have a minimum thickness of 6 inches in any part.  When the spell

\begin{effects} This spell immediately halts any damage being taken due
to shock or blood loss and the target gains 1 / Rank to their chance
of recovering from stun or unconsciousness (if applicable). It will
restore a (live) character on negative endurance to zero, although any
further damage will start the process of shock and bleeding as
usual. In addition, if the target is suffering from the adverse
effects of a fright roll or similar emotional effect, they get a
second roll (in some cases a second resistance roll) to recover from
(``or snap out of'') it with +1\% / Rank added to their dice roll. The
cause of the fright or shock may have been magical or otherwise. This
spell may be recast on each target as often as desired. This spell
will not work on regenerating entities (including those under the
effects of a trollskin spell).

\begin{effects} Each entity targeted by this spell must resist or
suffer [D - 4] (+ 1 / Rank) points of magical damage due to being pierced
by flying A class shards of ice (armour does absorb damage but there
is no AG loss). If this spell is doubled the adept may not double
damage but may choose to have the ice projectiles ignore armour
instead. If this spell is tripled, the adept may roll for a possible A
class specific grievous injury for each target that failed to resist,
in addition to ignoring armour as above (and still doing fatigue
damage except as part of the grievous result), or reduce the targets'
resistances as usual.

\begin{effects} This spell causes the ground within 5' of the Adept to
be instantly covered with 5 inches of conjured snow (returns to whence
it came when the spell duration expires).  Snowballs then form
themselves out of the snow and launch themselves at a target or
targets of the Adepts choice. Up to 1 target (+ 1 / 4 full Ranks) can
be pelted with a flurry of snowballs each pulse. A different set of
targets may be chosen by the Adept each pulse.  Each target must
resist or suffer a reduction of -1\% (- 1 / 2 full Ranks) to their Base
Chance of doing anything while being snowballed and in addition must
make a 4 \x WP roll (3 \x WP if Adept is above Rank 10 in this spell)
to perform any action that involves concentrating (\eg casting a
spell). Each target need only resist this spell once. If the Adept
leaves the 5' diameter circle of snow while this spell is in effect,
the spell is automatically dissipated.

\begin{effects} This spell causes snow to begin gently falling in an
area of between 5 feet minimum and 40 feet (+ 5 / Rank) maximum
diameter (chosen by the adept).  The snow will form in the air at
between 10 and 40 feet above the ground, and will gently float to the
ground.  The area within this spell, if above zero degrees in
temperature, will be magically cooled to zero degrees for the spell
duration (nb. This will not count as a positive modifier to Ice mage
base chances as it is magical, although it may reduce negative
modifiers to zero).  For each 5 minutes that this spell is in effect,
one inch of powder will cover the ground.  At the end of the spell the
snow will remain, but the temperature will be restored to normal (and
the snow may begin melting).  Note that if this spell is, for example,
cast inside a house with a 20 foot ceiling, as the snow is formed in
the air between 10 and 40 feet up, only a third of the snow will fall
in the room.  The other two thirds will appear above the 20 foot line
and will fall on the roof, with the exception of a small amount that
appears in the attic.

\begin{effects} This spell conjures a wall of ice that is 10' high, 20'
long and 2' thick, or a pillar 15' high with a 3' diameter.  The adept
may choose to increase the height of the wall by 1', the width by 2'
or the thickness by 6", or the height or diameter of the pillar by 1',
for each Rank the Adept possesses in the spell.  The wall may be
uniformly curved up to a half circle. The wall may not be created on
top of an entity, and is subject to the usual restrictions on physical
walls.  The wall is translucent but not transparent.  When the spell
duration expires the ice returns to whence it came.

\begin{effects} The weapon over which the spell is cast becomes
infernally cold without harm to either the weapon or the user of
it. The base chance of hitting with the weapon is increased by 1 (+ 1

full Ranks). This amount of damage is tripled if the object of the
attack is a creature of fire.

reduced by 25\% (if the entity can fly) due to Agility being reduced;
Damage from attacks is reduced by 25\% due to Strength reduction, Base
Chance to hit is reduced because of M.D. reduction, etc.).  Magical
abilities are not copied in the copied form, although quasi-magical
abilities may be.  The simulacrum will not bear a close resemblance to
any other figure unless the figure chosen to be duplicated is present
during the ritual. In the latter instance the figure being duplicated
may choose to actively resist the ritual; otherwise the ritual is

\section{The College of Ice Magics (Ver 1.3)}

d4 2
a5 31
The College of Ice Magics is concerned with the shaping of ice
and snow, freezing and the manipulation of cold.

Ice Mages have been most valuable to those fragile communities
living in cold, arid and often dangerous places, where food is
hard to grow and neighbours can be separated by days of
travel.  Many of the Ice Mages' Spells and Rituals are
designed either to enhance living in these inhospitable areas
or to aid hunting and defending themselves from arctic
predators.  Ice Mages are seldom seen in warm climates, and
have been unpopular with Philosophers of magic who cannot
agree whether to place Cold as an element in its own right. 
The College of Ice Magics has been likened to the Colleges of
Water, due to its connections with Ice and Snow, Fire, as an
antithesis, Air, due to its weather-like effects and Mind, due
to the perculiar mental fortitude its Adepts have demonstrated
while living in cold climes.

\begin{description}
\item[Philosophy]  Ice Mages tend to be of a solitary and quiet
nature, having lived their lives isolated and in areas of
sparse population density.  Many are hunters or only part-time
Mages.  They generally have fair relations with most Colleges,
but relations with the Fire and Water Colleges are distinctly
Icy.

\item[Traditional Colours]  Ice Mages are not known to dress
flamboyantly.  Whites and Greys are popular colours when
dressing in warmer climes, perhaps with a hint of pale blue. 
However in their own element they usually wear undyed leathers
and furs.

Water and Fire Magics have to each other.  Water Magics and Ice Magics
are not considered related; rather they are generally regarded as

Adepts of the College of Ice Magics may practise their arts
without restriction.
d56 15
a70 14
All base chances of Ice Mages are affected by temperature.
Only one of the temperature modifiers may be applied at one
time. Consult the Weather Scale Table for Weather Gauge
details.
 Temp.      Gauge   Temp. o  Mod.
Very Cold  0 - 3   <= - 5   + 10
Cold       4 - 5   <= 5     + 5

In addition the following modifier applies:
The Adept is standing on Ice or Snow in an area where it is in
abundance      + 5

\emph{Effects:}
d123 6
a128 7
This spell extinguishes all fires within a chosen 5
foot (+5 / Rank) diameter sphere, all of which must be within
the spells range, by smothering them with ice crystals.
Magical fires are not affected. This spell is identical to the
Fire College "Extinguish Fire Spell", except that the effect
is achieved by physical means (this is merely a cosmetic
difference).
a139 1
\emph{Effects:}
d141 6
a146 6
The Adept may freeze one object of up to 5 lb. (+5 /
Rank). This freezing will protect the object from decay while
the duration lasts. While frozen the object will be as cold as
ice to the touch and will drip slightly from condensation.
When the duration has expired the object will defrost at the
rate of 1 minute per pound of weight.
a157 1
\emph{Effects:}
d159 6
a164 6
This spell creates a film of ice 1 inch thick in a
single square of dimensions 1 foot each side (+1 foot each
side per Rank) or a single cube of ice of dimensions 6x6x6
inches (+6 inches each side per Rank).  The ice must be
created on the ground and not on top of an entity.  It is
non-magical and will persist until melted, etc.
d175 1
a175 2
\emph{Target:} Area \\
\emph{Effects:}
d177 8
a184 8
This spell enables 1 target (+1 / 4 full Ranks) to
travel over ice and/or snow without slipping or sinking in, as
if it were normal earth and/or rock.  For example, this would
enable climbers to climb icy slopes.  Quadrapeds are treated
as two targets for the purposes of this spell.  In addtion, if
the terrain travelled on is flat ice, each target's TMR is
increased by 1 (+1 / 3 full Ranks) while on the ice.  See 7.3,
Travel on Ice, for additional detail.
a195 1
\emph{Effects:}
d197 4
a200 4
The caster may cause the ambient temperature of one
15 \x 15 \x 15 foot cube to lower by 2o C / Rank. Note that this
spell is the Ice Mage counterpart to the Fire Mage Spell of
Temperature Alteration (G2).
a211 1
\emph{Effects:}
d213 6
a218 7
This spell protects the target from the effects of
cold temperature by increasing the Gauge by 1 (+1 / 4 full
Ranks) up to a maximum of Gauge 7 (Comfortable). It will
totally protect the target from the effects of Hypothermia at
Rank 11+. In addition, the target suffers 1 (+1 / 4 or
fraction Ranks) less damage due to magical or non-magical cold
based attacks. This spell is identical to the special

\emph{Duration:} Concentration, maximum of 15 minutes + 15 / Rank \\
a230 1
\emph{Effects:}
d232 11
a242 12
This spell enables the Adept to clear a path along
snow or ice obstructed ground and/or to tunnel through snow
and ice.  Any snow or ice up to 2 feet in front of the Adept
undergoes a change in density to dry snow, and is pushed to
either side, leaving a gap 2 feet wider, and higher (if
applicable), than the size of the Adept.  No more than 1 hex
(+1 / 2 full Ranks), may be cleared per pulse in this manner. 
This effect moves with the Adept.  The Adept may lean in order
to direct the path up or down.  Note that the walls and roof
of a tunnel through snow or ice are merely packed snow and do
not confer any particular structural support or stability. 
See 7.4, Travel on or through Snow, for additional detail.

The Adept can freeze up to 10 cubic feet (+10 / Rank)
of existing water based liquids into solid ice, or into snow
of a density chosen by the Adept. All the water to be
transformed must be within the Adept's range at the time of
casting. This spell may not be cast on or near entities or
their possessions.

The Adept must spend one hour in ritual construction
of a miniature dome made out of snow or ice cubes. At the end
of this time the Adept must make a successful cast check. If
successful, the dome swells in size to become an igloo of
internal size 5' radius (+1 / Rank) and 2' thick.  This ritual
cannot backfire.  The Igloo has a single entrance which is
chosen by the Adept  to be up to half its internal height in
both height and length. The inside temperature of the igloo
always counts as very cold (-10 degrees) and the following
enchantments apply to objects or entities while they remain
inside the igloo:
  -  All entities and creatures are treated as having a resist
cold spell upon them of equal rank to that of the Adepts Rank
in this ritual
  -  All organic objects are preserved from decay
In addition the igloo counts as bound snow while the duration
is in effect and will not melt or break due to non-magical
forces (although magical attacks affect it as normal).  Once
the duration runs out the igloo reverts to a normal
(non-magical) igloo and will thereafter melt, collapse etc. as
normal due to external conditions.

The Adept may bind all of the ice and snow within a
5' (+5 / Rank) radius circle of the Adept. The results of this
ritual are similar to those for the binding of other elements. 
The Adept gains control of all of the facets of the element. 
The Adept may move or shape the ice and snow, change its
consistency and instil intelligence in it as desired. 
Finally, the Adept may sacrifice a point of MA (this may be
relearned with experience) in order to make a part or all of
the bound ice and snow permanently bound.  In this instance,
the bound ice and snow is non-intelligent but magical, and is
enduring.  Almost no magical or physical force will affect it
(e.g. it resists Wizard's Eye and Telepathy), with the
exception of magical heat and fire, against which it has 100
times the resistance of ordinary ice and snow, and if any part
of it remains it will (slowly) regenerate.

The target of this spell is covered by a magical
Armour of Ice, which provides 5 points of Armour Protection 
(+1 / 4 full Ranks) which fluctuates according to the current
temperature: the Armour gains +2 points of Armour Protection
when the temperature is very cold, +1 when its cold, -1 when
its hot, and -2 when its very hot (see 1.2).  The armour has a
weight rating of 5 (see 18.1) and subtracts 2 from AG and 20
from stealth.  It is assumed that cloth armour is worn
underneath the Ice armour in order to provide insulation for
the wearer, and this is factored into the protection rating. 
If any other armour is worn underneath the Ice armour the
target wearing the armour is slowed (loses every second
pulse).  This spell will stack with other defensive spells.
The Ice Armour is vulnerable to Fire, and has an ablative
effect; it will absorb half of any fire damage taken, but for
every 10 points of damage one point of protection is removed
from the armour, and if the protection is reduced to 1 the
spell is immediately dissipated.

This spell turns one metal or mineral object of up to

to be entirely turned to ice but a single brick in a wall
could be transformed). The object is then transparent and
vulnerable to damage, heat etc. At the end of the duration,
the object will revert back, but any damage will not be
repaired.

(efreet, salamander or elemental) take half damage even if
they resist.

This spell may either be used to kill  (5 * Rank)\%
(min. 5) of all non-sentient plants within the Adepts range,
or the Adept may target and kill 1 individual plant (+1 /
Rank).  There is no visible effect, but death due to frostbite
occurs at the time of casting and no amount of non-magical
effort will revive plants affected by this spell.  Plants that
are especially resistant to cold may be entitled to a passive
resistance roll versus the spell's effects.

The target of this spell is placed in suspended
animation for up to (Rank \x Rank) days (minimum 1) as
specified by the Adept.  At Rank 20 there is no maximum and
the Adept may choose any duration.  All bodily functions
including ageing, are suspended for the duration of the spell
and the target feels cool to the touch. The target is immune
to cold and suffocation, and takes no more damage from
existing injuries while this spell is in effect. Additional
injuries will still effect the target, but any damage that
would occur due to bleeding, poison etc. is ignored while this
spell is in effect. When the spell duration runs out, or the
spell is dispelled, the target awakens with physical strength
reduced by 1 /  full week hibernated and begins to suffer from
any existing injuries and conditions (poison, disease, shock,
bleeding and suchlike). Physical strength may be regained at a
rate of 1 point per day, and is not reduced below 1. Entities
that naturally hibernate suffer -20 to their Magic Resistance
vs. this spell.

The Adept creates a 2 foot long, 2 inch diameter
non-magical bolt of ice which is projected at a target with a
Strike chance of 30\% (+3 / Rank) + MD + any modifiers normally
applied to the Adept's Strike Chance with a weapon (see Table
17.6, Enchantments etc.); also it has the Range modifiers of a
heavy crossbow. The ice bolt strikes as an A class weapon
doing D + 4 (+1 / Rank) damage which can stun and inflict
specific grievous injuries. Once the spell is cast the target
gets no magic resistance, but the target's defence is
subtracted from the chance to hit. N.B. Since the effect of
the spell is to create a physical bolt. a double or triple
effect cannot affect damage but may add +10\% and +20\% to the

in up to 1 + Rank shapes of the Adept's choice.  The shapes
always appear entirely within the range of the Adept and may
not appear above or inside (partially or wholly) any entity. 
Each shape must appear on the ground in a stable fashion (not
about to topple over) and must have a minimum thickness of 6
inches in any part.  When the spell duration expires, the ice
disappears (returns to whence it came).

The Adept creates a polyhedral iceberg of dimensions
10' high, 10' wide and 10' deep (+2 to each dimension / Rank). 
It may only be successfully created in an existing volume of
liquid sufficient to hold it without it touching the bottom.
8/9 of the Iceberg will be submerged. The Iceberg will be flat
topped and may stably support up to 1 hex of entities (+1 /
Rank) (Additional entities will cause it to roll in the
water). While the Adept is in contract with the Iceberg the
Adept may move the Iceberg at a speed of 5 miles per hour (+1
/ Rank). The Iceberg spell also has a calming effect on the
water around it, reducing the size of all waves up to Rank
feet away by Rank feet.

This spell immediately halts any damage being taken
due to shock or blood loss and the target gains 1 / Rank to
their chance of recovering from stun or unconsciousness (if
applicable). It will restore a (live) character on negative
endurance to zero, although any further damage will start the
process of shock and bleeding as usual. In addition, if the
target is suffering from the adverse effects of a fright roll
or similar emotional effect, they get a second roll (in some
cases a second resistance roll) to recover from ("or snap out
of") it with +1\% / Rank added to their dice roll. The cause of
the fright or shock may have been magical or otherwise. This
spell may be recast on each target as often as desired. This
spell will not work on regenerating entities (including those
under the effects of a trollskin spell).

Each entity targeted by this spell must resist or
suffer D-4 (+1 / Rank) damage due to being pierced by flying A
class shards of ice (armour does absorb damage but there is no
AG loss).  This damage may stun. If this spell is doubled the
adept may not double damage but may choose to have the ice
projectiles ignore armour instead. If this spell is tripled,
the adept may roll for a possible A class specific grievous
injury for each target that failed to resist, in addition to
ignoring armour as above (and still doing normal fatigue
damage except as part of the grievous result), or reduce the
targets' resistances as usual.

This spell causes the ground within 5' of the Adept
to be instantly covered with 5 inches of conjured  snow
(returns to whence it came when the spell duration expires).
Snowballs then form themselves out of the snow and launch
themselves at a target or targets of the Adepts choice. Up to
1 target (+1 / 4 full Ranks) can be pelted with a flurry of
snowballs each pulse. A different set of targets may be chosen
by the Adept each pulse.  Each target must resist or suffer a
reduction of -1\% (-1 / 2 full Ranks) to their Base Chance of
doing anything while being snowballed and in addition must
make a 4 \x WP roll (3 \x WP if Adept is above Rank 10 in this
spell) to perform any action that involves concentrating (e.g.
casting a spell). Each target need only resist this spell
once. If the Adept leaves the 5' diameter circle of snow while
this spell is in effect, the spell is automatically
dissipated.

(+1 / Rank). Each rank may only increase a single dimension.
The wall may be uniformly curved up to a half circle. The wall
may not be created on top of an entity, and is subject to the
usual restrictions on physical walls.  The wall is translucent
but not transparent.  When the spell duration expires the ice
returns to whence it came.

The Adept colours everything within Range the colour
of pure white snow. All entities get a resistance to be
unaffected and remain their natural colours. An entity which
views entities and objects that are snow white cannot
distinguish them from the background when over 5' away from
them. Infravision also perceives a uniform cool temperature,
although witchsight will work as usual. If there is sharp
shadowing, or the object or entity moves, the observer gets a
3xPerception check to locate the Entity/Object in order to
target them with ranged attacks (which are made at  -20\%) or
magic. Motionless Entities and Objects not in sharp shadowing
are effectively invisible; they may not be targeted, and
attacks against them are made at -50\% even if the attacker
knows the location of the target (e.g. by having observed them
up until they stopped moving).  Under 5' in range any moving
Entity or object can be seen easily and there are no penalties
to combat

thrive even in permafrost and arctic temperatures.

The Adept spends an hour forming a human or animal figure, no larger
than 1 hex in size, out of snow, which must be already present. The
animated sculpture will have the same characteristics as the
sculptured entity, except that all characteristics are reduced by
25\%. This will generally cause abilities to be lessened by a like
amount (e.g. Flying speed is reduced by 25\% (if the entity can fly)
due to Agility being reduced; Damage from attacks is reduced by 25\%
due to Strength reduction, Base Chance to hit is reduced because of
M.D.  reduction, etc.).  Magical abilities are not copied in the
copied form, although quasi-magical abilities may be.  The simulacrum
will not bear a close resemblance to any other figure unless the
figure chosen to be duplicated is present during the ritual. In the
latter instance the figure being duplicated may choose to actively
resist the ritual; otherwise the ritual is non-resistible. The
simulacrum has only animal intelligence, and the Adept may give it
simple instructions or actively concentrate to control its movements
(requires the Adept to perform pass actions). The simulacrum will have
vague inclinations relation to its original (borrowed) form, and
although no longer comprised of snow (it takes on a fleshy appearance,
or whatever is appropriate for the original entity) will have an
adverse reaction to the presence of heat and flame and will take an
additional 2 points from heat and flame attacks. The simulacrum
normally resembles a generic example of its borrowed form except that
it has a snowy sheen to it and is cool to the touch. Clothes,
possessions and suchlike are not duplicated by this ritual. When the
Adepts concentration ceases, the simulacrum will collapse into a pile
of ordinary non-magical snow.

humanoids with frosty hair and silvery blue eyes. They are
half as tall, in feet, as their Endurance.

\item[Talents, Skills and Magic]

Ice Elementals can disappear into Ice with only a 10\% chance of being
detected. They can freeze water within line of sight at a rate of one
cubic foot per pulse for every point of Physical strength available to
the Elemental (entities within the area get a 3 \x AG check to avoid
being caught and trapped while Ice forms around them), and they can
cast a Ice construction and Wall of Ice at a Rank equal to their
summoner's Rank + 4 in this ritual. These are talents and cost no
fatigue. They may expend 2 fatigue to fire an Ice bolt (as per the
Spell) striking as an A class weapon with a base chance equal to the
Elemental's combined maximum Endurance and Fatigue, and doing D+4 (+1
/ Rank) points of damage. Since this is a physical attack formed from
the Ice Elemental, the Ice bolt remains after firing.

The GM should consult the weather table and advise the player of the
current level of these three components before the Adept starts

table with the proviso that the Adept may never raise the temperature,
and must lower it by at least one degree. All weather within 2 miles

a single inch of ice may cover a lake).  Ice is deemed to have 10
points of fatigue per inch, 120 points per foot.  It takes only half
damage from being hit by B class weapons, full damage from axes, fire
and water based attacks, and double damage from picks (note that for
fire based attacks bonuses against cold creatures apply, for those
spells that have them).  Other weapons only do a single point.
Endurance blows do double damage.  The exception is when a blow by any
weapon exceeds the remaining fatigue in the ice; in this case all
damage is applied (the ice breaks).  Successful elimination of the
ice's fatigue makes a human sized hole in the ice, big enough for a
one hex entity to go through.  Multiple entities may attempt to break
through the same area of ice, within reason.  Smaller holes may be
made but for the purposes of simplicity are no quicker to make (when
digging far into the ice at least a human sized hole must be made in
order to keep working anyway).

Entities going prone may also slide up to half their TMR along the ice
in the pulse in which they fell, depending on how much of their
movement was in one direction (GM's discretion).
