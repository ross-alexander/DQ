@\begin{college}[1.2]{earth}{Earth Magics}{EA}

The College of Earth Magics is concerned with the shaping of the
powers of the earth itself and of those entities and things that are
rooted in the earth or in contact with it.

There are two distinct branches of this College, and a practitioner of
Earth Magic college can be a member of only one branch at a time.
They may alter their affiliation, but are treated as if they had quit
their original branch and lost all knowledge of Earth Magic until such
time as they has spent six months in study and meditation to relearn
the General Knowledge of the College in a new form.  The two divisions
of this College are:

\begin{Description}
\item[Pacifistic Earth Magic]

Usually practiced by wild people who live in isolation in the
wilderness, this type of Earth Magic is very powerful, but entirely
defensive in nature.  An adherent of this division of Earth Magic will
never attack without provocation (\ie unless attacked themself or
unless they see animals or plants attacked).  They are unaffected by
counterspells of their College cast over an area they which occupy
while attempting to work the magic of their College.  In addition, the
counterspells of their College give only half the normal benefit to
characters attempting to resist their magic.  However, they may never
participate in rituals of this College which involve human sacrifice.

\item[Druidic Earth Magic]

This form of Earth Magic is practiced by strong-willed individuals who
have no objection to the taking of human life to further their magic.
It is often practiced communally since it is in part ritual magic.
Many of the rituals involve courting the darker sides of earth by
providing blood to quench its thirst.

\end{Description}

\subsection{Restrictions}

Practitioners of the College of Earth Magics must always be in contact
with the earth to perform magic of this College.

A practitioner of this College is considered in contact with the earth
if they are in contact with an item which is, itself, rooted in the
earth (tree, plant, foundation of a house, etc.). They would not be in
contact with earth if they were in the air or in water where they
could not touch bottom, or if they were atop a piece of furniture or
an animal as these are not rooted in the ground.  An Adept in a
person's arms is not in contact with the earth.

The MA requirement of this College is 15.

\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}

The following numbers are added to the Base Chance of performing any
talent, spell or ritual of the College of Earth Magics.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Adept is wearing a sprig of fresh mistletoe		& 5 \\
Adept is in contact with earth, but beneath water\dag	&-20 \\
Adept is in a manmade dwelling without an earthen floor & -5 \\
Adept occupies a place of power\ddag 			& 20 \\
\end{tabularx}

\dag For example, beneath the ocean, if the Adept can find a way of
breathing in such a situation, the Adept's BC would always be
reduced by 20.

\ddag These can be any places frequented by worshippers of earth.
Examples from mythology and literature might include: Stonehenge,
Finn McCool's Seat, The Hill of Tara, etc.  If the Place of Power is
used for ritual sacrifice, the practioners of Pacifistic Earth Magic
would receive no benefit.

All modifiers are cumulative.  They are in addition to the modifiers
listed in \S\ref{magic:modifiers}.

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Detect Aura}

\range{Special}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{PC + 5\% / Rank}
\resist{Active}
\target{Entity, Object, Area, Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Base Chance is reduced by 1\% for every foot after the first five
feet the target is from the Adept.  The results of this talent are the
same as given in \S \ref{magic:detect-aura}.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}


\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Converse With Animals}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{3 hours + 3 hours / Rank}
\multiple{50}
\basechance{45\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may communicate with fauna (whether verbally or
symbolically, and to what extent, are left up to the GM's discretion).
Physical contact between the animal and the Adept increases the Base
Chance of successfully casting this spell by 5.  This spell does not
include avians or fish and has to be recast for each type of animal,
for example talking to wolves does not allow the Adept to talk to
tigers.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Converse With Plants}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{3 hours + 3 / Rank}
\multiple{50}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can communicate with flora with which they are familiar.
The mode and extent of communication is up to the GM's discretion.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Controlling Animals}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Animal}
\begin{effects}
The Adept controls the actions of any animal that does not
successfully resist.  It will serve them so long as they continue to
concentrate.  If they release the animal or their concentration is
broken, it may attack them or flee.  The chance to cast this spell is
reduced by 5\% if the Adept cannot speak to the animal.  If the Adept
cannot make eye contact, the Base Chance is reduced another 5\%.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Blending}

\range{15 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{50}
\basechance{60\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Once this spell is cast, the target must remain still in order for it
to have effect.  While remaining still, the target is not able to be
seen by non-magical means (\ie as for invisibility).  If the target
moves, the spell ceases to work.  However, if the target becomes still
again during the duration of the spell, it will resume its effect.
The duration of the spell refers to the time since casting, not the
time that the spell is actually in effect (\ie while the target is
still).

Keeping still will require (as a minimum) a 4 \x WP check every
hour.  The target may be required to make additional willpower checks
at the GM's discretion.

The spell only has effect while the target is ``still''.  This means
that the target is unable to move any of its external surfaces, with
limited exceptions.  Moving an external surface encompasses such
actions as moving a limb, or opening and closing the mouth.  Blinking
and normal bodily movement caused by normal breathing will not
constitute moving for the purposes of this spell.  The following
actions will automatically cause the spell to cease working: talking,
spellcasting, triggering (subject to any revision of the Investment
ritual), readying a weapon, altering facing in a hex, moving from the
hex, using a silent language, or indeed any Action other than a Pass
action (and Pass actions being restricted as outlined).  Note that it
is not relevant if an observer would see the movement for the spell to
cease working (\eg moving hands behind back, or talking behind hand
will both cause the spell to cease having an effect).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Walking Unseen}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not invisible.  This
means that it will not transmit light.  As a consequence the target
will cast a shadow (which may or may not be noticed depending on the
lighting etc --- even if noticed may not be connected to the target)
and have a reflection in a mirror (or any reflective surface).
However the target may not be noticed even if another entity is
looking directly at him/her. It should be noted that a crystal of
vision or similar would count as looking directly at the target, not
as a reflection.  An entity will get a perception check if the target
becomes invasive on that entity's senses (\eg standing in a frontal
adjacent hex, or standing behind the entity with the target's hands
over his/her eyes).  Although the target is not invisible, it may be
detected using any magical means for detecting invisible entities (\eg
witchsight).

If the target of the spell be touched by another entity, or that
entity's possessions, then the spell is broken.  The target of the
spell may not break it voluntarily (other than by, for example,
touching another entity). Once broken the spell must be recast.
\end{effects}

every percentile dice roll in which the character is directly
involved.  This spell cannot be cast over oneself.  The duration of
the enchantment is as follows; Ranks 1--10 = a fortnight; Ranks 11--19

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-10]{Herbal Lore}

It also increases their chance of finding herbs (as per the Herbalist
or Ranger skills) by 2\% (+ 2 / Rank).  If the Adept is already ranked in
Herbalist or Ranger, then they gain an additional +10\%.

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Earth Hammer}

\range{25 feet + 10 / Rank}

the ground within range.  Each hand is 7 feet tall and all must be
contiguous to each other.  They may clutch anything that enters the
hex they occupy and will continue to do so until they have caught
something.  Any entity standing on a spot where a hand materialises
will be snatched up if they fail to resist, otherwise the hand appears
next to them within the hex.  Any entity caught will still be able to
wield a weapon or cast if they roll under 2 \x MD.  Entities (or
combination of entities) with a combined PS + target's AG greater than

\begin{effects}
This spell may impart partial mobility to a number of plants
(including trees) equal to the Adept's Rank.  The plants may not
uproot themselves, but may move their branches and leaves while
remaining in the same spot.  The plant's actions are always under the
control of the Adept so long as they maintain their concentration.  If
their concentration is broken, voluntarily or otherwise, the plants

\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Animal}
\begin{effects}
This spell is similar to the Spell of Controlling Animals except that
the Adept does not have to concentrate on it to maintain it. The
spell will last until broken by the animal or dispelled by magic.  Any
animal subject to this spell makes one check per week against its
Willpower to determine if the spell is broken.  This only works on
land animals, it will not work on avians or aquatics.

\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Earth Elemental}
\begin{effects}
If the cast is successful, an Earth Elemental with a combined Fatigue
and Endurance of 15 (+ 5 / Rank) appears within 20 feet of the Adept.
The Adept automatically casts a Spell of Controlling Earth Elemental
to see if they control the Elemental.  The Control spell is a separate
spell and requires additional fatigue to cast, but does not require
any preparation and is cast in conjunction with this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Controlling Earth Elemental}

\range{20 feet}

\multiple{225}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Earth Elemental}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may attempt to control an Elemental they have just summoned.
The Elemental does not get to resist.  If successful in establishing
control over the Elemental, the Adept maintains control until their
concentration is broken or they banish the Elemental with a
counterspell.  If they fail to gain control of the Elemental or gain
control, but have their concentration broken, the Elemental will
immediately attack them.  The Adept cannot banish an Elemental they do
not control.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell opens a circular pit under a single human-sized target per
5 (or fraction) Ranks and sucks the unfortunate standing over it down
to be encased in rock 5 (+ 5 / Rank) feet underground. This spell may
be used to affect multi-hex targets, each hex of the target counts as
one human-sized target.  If the spell does not affect every hex which
the target occupies then the target will not be affected.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-13]{Wall of Stone}

entity.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\range{20 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{250}

\begin{effects}
The spell allows the subject to regenerate Endurance Points.  The
target begins to regenerate the pulse after the spell is cast and
continues to regenerate at the rate of 1 Endurance Point per pulse for
the duration of the spell.  The spell will not help regenerate wounds
inflicted by acid or fire.  An entity will not die from damage while

within the area covered by the pool suffers damage of [D - 5] (+ 1 /
Rank).  If the target successfully resists, this damage is halved.
Note that while the entity is within the area of effect the damage is
applied ever pulse.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-18]{Diamond Javelins}

\range{30 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell causes diamond-tipped javelins to fly from the earth at the
Adept's feet and travel toward a target(s) of the Adept's choice.  The
number of javelins which appear is 1 (+ 1 / 2 (or fraction) Ranks).
The javelins have a Base Chance to hit equal to the Base Chance of
ordinary javelins + 3 / Rank.  Each javelin does [D - 4] (+ 1 / 2 (or
fraction) Ranks) damage.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-19]{Earth Transformation}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{3 hours + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
This spell turns 3 (+ 1 / Rank) cubic feet of stone into mud or vice
versa.  An entity standing on a spot containing a mud puddle that is
turned to stone has an opportunity to passively resist the effects of
the spell. If they fail to resist, they will become trapped in the
stone that has taken the place of the mud they were standing in.  If
they resist, the mud turns to stone, but they are not trapped.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[R-1]{Binding Earth}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: maximum 1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{None}
\target{Earth}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{A human (or humanoid)}
\actions{Sacrifice human}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
If the is ritual successful, the Adept gains complete control over a
500 pound weight of earth and stone (plus an additional 500 pound
weight per Rank).  They can shape or move the earth, change its
consistency or instill intelligence in it as they choose.  The Base
Chance to successfully employ this ritual is 10\%.  It can affect any
earth or stone within 10 feet (+ 10 / Rank) of the Adept.  If a ritual
sacrifice of a human (or humanoid) being is performed at the end of
the duration, the affected earth becomes permanently bound (that is,
it contains no life and blocks all earth shaping effects, for example,
Hands of Earth, Earth Elementals, Tunnelling).

The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not invisible.  If the
target of the spell, or the target's possessions, are touched by
another entity, or that entity's possessions, then the spell is
broken.  An entity's possessions are those non-entity things which the
entity is wearing or carrying at that time.  An unconscious or
sleeping entity is not a possession, it is still an entity. The target
of the spell may not break it voluntarily (other than by, for example,
a220 15

The target of the spell is not invisible.  This means that it will not
transmit light.  As a consequence the target will cast a shadow (which
may or may not be noticed depending on the lighting etc -- even if
noticed may not be connected to the target) and have a reflection in a
mirror (or any reflective surface).  However the target may not be
noticed even if another entity is looking directly at them. It should
be noted that a crystal of vision or similar would count as looking
directly at the target, not as a reflection.  An entity will get a
perception check if the target becomes invasive on that entity's
senses (\eg standing in a frontal adjacent hex, or standing behind
the entity with the target's hands over their eyes).  Although the
target is not invisible, it may be detected using any magical means
for detecting invisible entities (\eg witchsight).

This spell is cast over a weapon of the Adept's choice.  It increases
a weapon's strike chance by Rank\% (minimum of 1).  The chance of an

weapon under the effect of this spell (\ie break chance becomes

The spell may impart partial mobility to a number of plants (including

themselves, but may move their branches and leaves while remaining in
the same spot.  The plant's actions are always under the control of
the Adept so long as they maintain their concentration.  If their
concentration is broken, voluntarily or otherwise, the plants will be
controlled by the GM until the Adept reestablishes control and could,
conceivably attack the Adept.

The spell causes a Rank number of hands of stone to materialise out of
the ground within range.  Each hand is 7 feet tall and must be
adjacent to each other.  They may clutch anything in their grasp
immediately after casting, but become stationary after that (that is
they only try at clutch something once).  Any entity standing on a
spot where a hand materialises will be snatched up if they fail to
resist, otherwise the hand appears next to them within the hex.  Any
entity caught will keep their upper body free if they roll under 2 \x
AG.  Entities (or combination of entities) with a PS over 15 + Rank /
2 may attempt a 1 \x PS to escape from the Hands per pulse after the
first.

The spell causes a number of hands of stone equal to the Rank of the
caster to materialise out of the ground within range.  Each hand is 7
feet tall.  Once they appear, they remain stationary.  They may clutch
anything in their grasp, but may not move from the spot on which they
surfaced.  A character standing on a spot where a hand materialises
will be snatched up and will be unable to move until the spell
dissipates.

The spell allows the subject to regenerate Endurance Points removed as
a result of damage incurred in combat.  The target begins to
regenerate 30 seconds after a wound is inflicted and continues to
regenerate at the rate of 1 Endurance Point per pulse for the duration
of the spell.  The spell will not help regenerate wounds inflicted by
acid or fire.  A character will not die from damage while under the
effects of a trollskin, even if they are below negative half

At the end of the ritual, the Adept's player rolls D100.  If the
resulting number is equal to or less than the Adept's Magical
Aptitude, then a number of small animals appear equal to the Adept's
Rank (1 if the Adept has no Rank with the ritual).  The animal the
Adept attempts to summon must be a native of the area.  If the Adept
chooses to vocalize his summons (assuming they are not attempting to
go undetected since the vocalization must be in the form of a shout or
call), the Base Chance is increased by 25.
