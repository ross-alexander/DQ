@\begin{college}[1.4]{illusion}{Illusions}{IL}

The College of Illusions is concerned with truth, deception and
sensation. Practitioners of the College (or Art) of Illusions are
called Illusionists. This College is one of extremes, of subtlety and
flamboyance, and especially of deception and honesty. Illusionists are
taught that they are privy to one of the most potent truths known to
the sentient races, namely that our senses are the only window to the
existence of reality. Based on this doctrine, they change the
appearance of reality rather than the actual nature. This often leads
to more impressive but superficial effects than other Colleges. These
effects have meant that Illusionists have historically been associated
with stage magicians and sleight-of-hand artists, which has degraded
their status in the eyes of other Adepts. Most accept their stage
heritage, and revel in the layers of deception involved in revealing a
great truth to their audience. Some, however, become enmeshed within
their own fantasy and fail to differentiate between this and
reality. Others deny this deception totally, and turn to death as the
only fixed point in a changing world. These Adepts use people's
dependency on their senses to cause death and despair.

\subsubsection{Traditional Colours}

The more flamboyant of the Illusionists will often wear bright, even
garish clothing incorporating as many colours as possible. These
colours will usually not clash, but the Illusionist wearing them will
stand out in any crowd. At the very least, most Illusionists will wear
extremes of colours; fire, blood, sable, snow, charcoal, emerald,
gold, etc.

\subsubsection{Traditional Symbols}

The College of Illusions is associated with a plethora of symbols
adopted from individual performers. Theatrical symbology is common.


\subsubsection{On Illusions}

Most Magics in this College are Illusions.  Illusions cannot be
``disbelieved''; the images are there and will interact with light and
sound in the same manner as the objects they represent. Mirrors and
light sources may not be created. Unless stated, the Illusions will
not be substantial, and any solid objects or spells will pass through
them. Illusions will interact with each other as if real. Illusion
spells may be dispelled by anyone with the appropriate counterspell,
although Illusions on an entity gains their passive magic resistance.

\subsection{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Illusions may practice their arts without
restrictions.

The MA requirement for becoming an Adept of the College of Illusions
is 13.


\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}

The Base Chance of performing any talent, spell or ritual of the
College of Illusions may be modified by conditions.

As the successful performance of Illusion magic is as much finesse and
presentation as raw power, a knowledge of the Performing Arts is
considered essential by many Adepts. Furthermore, willing a change in
reality to the level of detail necessary for deception, requires good
concentration and Willpower. The following conditions modify the base
chances of the College of Illusions:

{\small \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
For each point the Adept's Willpower varies from 15	& +/- 1 \\
For each two full Ranks in Troubadour	& + 1 \\
\end{tabularx}}

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Concealed Casting}

\multiple{150}
\begin{effects}
This Talent allows the Adept to cast without any apparent movement or
noise. The Adept may not speak or make meaningful or extravagant
actions. They may not cast without a hand free or if mute. If an
observer is intent on the Adept (\eg in conversation with), the
observer may make a (2 \x PC) - Rank check to notice. All aspects of
the Spell (including Base Chance) must be cast at the lower of the
Talent's and Spell's ranks, and the Base Chance is further reduced by
20\%. The Talent only functions with spells of the College of
Illusions.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Enhanced Vision}

\multiple{225}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may see through any obscurement such as smoke, dust, water,
fog, cloud or rain (though not darkness) to a distance of 10 feet (+
10 / Rank) as if unobscured. Normal penalties then accrue from this
range. The Adept may see objects or entities that are invisible - they
appear to have a slight blue sheen around them. If the invisibility
effect (excluding Walking Unseen) is of a higher Rank than the
Enhanced Vision, the object or entity may not be clearly identified or
directly magically targeted. The Adept has a Base Chance of PC (+ 5 /
Rank) of Detecting Illusions if they take a Pass Action --- each
Illusion may only be checked once. Detecting an Illusion does not
nullify its effects.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-3]{Project Image}

\multiple{200}
\begin{effects}
This Talent creates a visual Illusion of the Adept, who becomes
Invisible as per (G-4) except that attacking in melee will always
disrupt this Talent. Initially, the image forms over the Adept. The
image will reflect the current appearance of the Adept, in any desired
stance. The image may only be changed or moved (at TMR) when the Adept
takes a pass action. The image must remain in line of sight and within
15 feet (+ 15 / Rank), and may not pass through solid objects.  At
Rank 5, the image may make appropriate environmental noises, \eg
foot-steps. At Rank 10, the Adept may move while maintaining the
relative distance and direction to their image. At Rank 15, the Adept
may project their voice through the image. At Rank 20, the Illusionist
may also see through the image. The abilities gained at Ranks 15 and
20 require pass actions to use.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Audile Illusion}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This Illusion allows the Adept to create up to Rank simple sounds,
each coming from a location fixed either absolutely or relative to an
object. Whilst taking a pass action, the Adept may cause any
combination of these sounds to occur. Sounds and locations are defined
as they are first used, not at time of casting. No language or musical
instrument may be imitated. The maximum volume at Ranks 0--4 is that of
a stage whisper (usually clearly audible at 25'), at Ranks 5--9, normal
conversation (50'), at Ranks 10--14, shouting (200'), at Ranks 15--19,
screaming (500'), and at Rank 20, thunder (1 mile). The range at which
the sound will be clearly heard is affected by the ambient level of
noise.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Flash of Light}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates a blinding flash of light emanating from the
Adept's body. This light is magical in nature, and may cut through
areas of magical darkness. All entities not shielded by a solid object
and within range must either resist or be blinded for 5 seconds (+ 5 /
2 full Ranks). Blinded characters have their Strike Chance reduced by
50, and they move at half their normal TMR. The Adept is normally not
affected by this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Illusion of Food}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may change the taste, appearance and smell of up to 1 cubic
foot of food or drink (+ 1 / Rank). At Rank 11, the Adept may create
(Rank - 10) pounds of food or drink. This magically created food will
recover fatigue for the duration of the spell. The Adept's Cooking
Rank will effectively be improved by 2, or to a minimum of Rank / 2.
No other properties (\eg poison, magic) may be changed or created with
this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Invisibility}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity or Object}
\begin{effects}
The target is made invisible, but cannot melee attack without becoming
visible. At Rank 16, the target can attack in melee whilst
invisible. The target may become visible at will. Once they have
become visible, the spell ends. The effects of this spell are
identical to the E \& E College spell of the same name.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Personalised Illusion}

\range{30 feet + 30 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This Illusion creates an image of a specific type peculiar to the
Adept. At Rank 0, the image must be of a rock. At each of Ranks 4, 8,
11, 14, 16, 18, 19 and 20, another image may be chosen. The Adept may
select the colouring, size and conformation of the image at cast time
(\eg a closed iron chest, or an open wooden casket) up to a maximum
diameter of 5' and height of 8'. The Illusion is not affected by
physical laws except that it is opaque to light. The Adept may move or
rotate (though not manipulate) the Illusion by taking a pass
action. The workmanship is as if the Adept were an Artisan of
one-third Rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Illusion of Seeming}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Object or Illusion}
\begin{effects}
This Illusion creates a visual image of up to 2 cubic foot (+ 2 /
Rank) on an object, which will move with the object if the object
changes shape or position, and dissipate if the object is destroyed.
The Adept may move or change the image by taking a pass action to
concentrate on it. The object has not been changed, and still has its
original physical properties. The workmanship is as if the Adept were
an Artisan of one-third Rank.

If the target is an Illusion, the target may be changed to any other
form that it could normally take. Up to 1 cubic foot of the target (+
1 / Rank) may be changed during each pass action. This change will
revert if the Seeming ceases before the target Illusion. The Adept may
only affect their own Illusions.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Static Illusion}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates a visual Illusion within a volume no larger than
(Rank + 3) feet by (Rank / 2 + 2) feet by (Rank / 3 + 1) feet. The
Illusion is fixed at casting, and may not be changed or moved with
this spell. The workmanship is as if the Adept were an Artisan of
one-half Rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Illusionary Wall}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates an Illusion of a non-solid, linear or smoothly
curved wall. It may have all the characteristics of any other wall
spell (except solidity, damage or fear), or mimic an adjacent surface
instead. The wall is 20' by 10' by 12", with each Rank altering its
height or width by 2' or thickness by 4". The wall must be attached
along the entirety of one of its thinnest edges.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Illusionary Cloaking}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{6 hours + 6 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\% + 4\% / Rank}
\target{Area}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{None}
\begin{effects}
This ritual creates a subtle visual Illusion over all non-living
matter within range according to the Adept's wishes. Only surface
appearance is changed, and this ritual does not provide invisibility.
This means that objects will retain their silhouette, and the Illusion
will fill the same volume as the object. The new appearance will fade
over the last hour of the duration. The workmanship is as if the Adept
were an Artisan of one-half Rank.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-2]{Illusory Fog}

\range{30 feet + 30 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{40\% + 4\% / Rank}
\target{Area}
\casttime{30 minutes}
\material{None}
\begin{effects}
This ritual creates Illusory fog to a height of 10 feet + 2 / Rank
within range. The fog will rise within five minutes of the ritual's
completion, centred on the spot where the Adept performed the
ritual. The fog has a visibility of 20 hexes (- 1 / Rank).
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Illusionary Animal}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
An Illusion of a non-magical, non-sentient creature of no larger than
10 lb + 10 lb \x Rank squared is created. The Illusion will have the
instincts of the creature it is based on, though it will obey most
simple mental instructions from the Adept. This communication is
one-way, and may only occur while the animal is within range of the
spell. No other communication is possible - it has no mind.  The
animal has the minimum PS, MD, AG, TMR and PC for the selected
creature.  The animal is solid, and can bear weight. It cannot attack
effectively, nor cause fear. Only creatures previously observed by the
Adept may be created. Smell, sound and feel are created as
appropriate. If damaged, the Illusion is dissipated. The Adept may
perceive through the animal's senses as follows: Rank 3 taste; Rank 7
smell; Rank 11 touch; Rank 15 hearing; Rank 19 sight.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Illusionary Bolt}

\range{15 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{5 seconds + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity, Object or Area}
\begin{effects}
An Illusion of any dangerous-looking object of ``throwable'' size is
created in the Adept's hand. When thrown, it flies in a straight line,
doing (D-2) + 1 / 2 full Ranks magical damage to the first Entity or
object struck. Illusions take double damage from this bolt.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Illusory Creation}

\range{Touch}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates the Illusion of one small object. The object will
have the physical attributes of one of the following: cloth, leather,
wood, bronze; to a maximum of 1 lb (+ 1 / 3 full Ranks). The object
will be of a single form, with no moving or removable pieces, though
of any combination of colours. The object will interact normally with
its surrounds. The workmanship is as if the Adept were an Artisan of
one-third Rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Illusion of Deep Pockets}

\range{Self}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This Illusion creates 1 magical pocket (+ 1 / Rank) about the Adept's
clothing. Each pocket can hold an object with a largest dimension of
no more than 1 inch (+ 1 / Rank). No entity can be placed in a pocket.
The total weight held may not exceed 1 lb (+ 1 / Rank), and no
individual object can weigh more than half this amount. The pockets
are not obvious, but thorough investigation may find them: searchers
get a (2 \x PC) - Rank check to notice. Items within the pockets may
not be located by spells of a lesser rank. The pockets may only be
accessed while the Adept is clothed; however, a new set of clothes
will still contain the pockets. At the end of the spell, the pockets
expel their contents.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Disguise Illusion}

\range{Touch}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may change the target's appearance. The target may not be
located by location spells of a lesser rank. The target's height may
vary by 1\% / Rank, and their weight by 2\% / Rank. The target's voice
or clothing may be changed at Rank 5 or both of these at Rank 10; an
individual may be duplicated or gender or race changed at Rank 15; or
two of these at Rank 20. If clothes are included in the spell, they
revert to normal if discarded. The disguised form has the PB of the
target +/- 2 / 3 full Ranks, within racial limitations.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Illusionary Euphonia}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This Illusion creates the sound of harmonious voices or musical
instruments. One instrument (+ 1 / 3 full Ranks) may be played; or one
voice (+ 1 / 6 full Ranks) may speak or sing. Each may come from a
different location fixed either absolutely or relative to an
object. The effective rank of the performance or conversation is
Rank/2, to a maximum of the Adept's rank in the instrument or
language. Pass actions are required for musical performance at a skill
level above Rank/5, or conversation. The maximum volume at Ranks 0-4
is that of a stage whisper (usually clearly audible at 25'), at Ranks
5-9, normal conversation (50'), at Ranks 10-14, shouting (200'), at
Ranks 15-19, screaming (500'), and at Rank 20, thunder (1 mile). The
range at which the sound will be clearly heard is affected by the
ambient level of noise.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Hallucination}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{225}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell enables the Adept to select 1 entity (+ 1 / 3 full Ranks)
as an audience for their Illusions. Whenever the Adept casts an
Illusion, they must decide whether everyone can perceive it, or just
the targets of this spell. This spell does not circumvent any
resistance checks by the targets. The Illusion must be cast during the
duration of this spell although the effects may last after the
Hallucination duration has expired.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Heroism}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell charges the target with great might and heroism. They seem
taller and stronger, and their actions gain a natural grace and power.
All allies (in line-of-sight) led by the target gain a bonus die
modifier of 1 (+ 1 / Rank) to all fear checks, while neutral observers
gain a bonus of 1 (+ 1 / Rank) to reaction rolls.  The target gains a
defence bonus of 1\% + 1\% / Rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Illusion of Innocence}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Active}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This Illusion changes the mien of 1 entity (+ 1 / 4 full Ranks). This
influences the initial reactions of all entities who perceive the
target: they will react as if the target is an innocent (this does not
necessarily mean a favourable reaction). The spell does not force
people to act stupidly - if the target does not act appropriately,
their opinion may be revised rapidly. Extreme behaviour terminates
these effects. For example, should a target prepare a weapon, cast a
passively resistible spell, or attack, the spell will dissipate.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Maze}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{5 seconds + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target is transported into a hedge-maze of perpetual fog, where
they may wander as they will. The hex that they occupied is filled
with opaque mist that disperses in 5 seconds. At the end of the spell,
the target reappears in their original hex (they are displaced by
solids but displace fluids); any items dropped inside the maze
reappear along with the target. Whilst in the maze, they must make a 2
\x WP check each pulse to perform a non-pass action. Personal magical
effects continue, (\eg while a Phantasm would follow the target into
the maze, Agony wouldn't). For all purposes, the Maze is deemed to be
on the same plane that the target just disappeared from. Each target
appears within their own unique Maze. The Adept may still see (and
thus cast upon) the target, but not physically contact them.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Illusion of Metamorphosis}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{225}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target's appearance alters to that of a one hex creature of at
least (target's PS + EN) pounds, over a period of 5 seconds. Their
actual form and characteristics do not change. They do not gain any
special abilities (\eg poison, magic, fear, flight) associated with
that animal. The Adept must be familiar with the desired animal. The
spell will cease when the target takes effective Endurance damage.
Creatures available by Rank:

\begin{Description}
\item[Rank 0] Small Land Animals;
\item[Rank 4] Felines, Apes \& Prehumans;
\item[Rank 8] Avians, Fish, Lizards \& Snakes;
\item[Rank 12] Horses, Large Land Animals;
\item[Rank 16] Earth Dwellers, Fairy Folk, Humans;
\item[Rank 20] Giants.
\end{Description}
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-12]{Illusion of Mist}

\range{20 feet + 20 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates an Illusion of 1000 cubic feet of mist (+ 500 /
Rank) of any shape entirely within the Adept's range. The mist must be
least 1 foot in any dimension and may have detail no finer than one
foot in size. The visibility in this mist is 20 feet (- 1 / Rank). The
mist is not affected by wind. By taking a pass action, the Adept may
move the mist up to 1 hex / pulse so long as it remains within range.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-13]{Illusion of Multiple Images}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 minute + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
One image of the target (+ 1 / 5 full Ranks) appears in the target's
hex. Each image disappears upon receiving damage. All images are
identical to the target, and will imitate their actions faithfully.
The images have the same defence as the target, but no magic
resistance. Any targeted attack has an equal chance of hitting each
image and the target. More than one image may be struck by a
multi-target or area effect attack.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-14]{Nightmare Illusion}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a terrifying, hostile and dangerous Illusion. The
Nightmare is initially under the Adept's control, and will obey their
commands until the Adept's concentration is broken or the Nightmare is
slain or dissipated. The Nightmare is totally insubstantial and
invisible to all who resist. The Nightmare has a combined EN and FT of
20 (+ 5 / 2 full Ranks), but no defence or armour.  It can
automatically hit up to two different targets a pulse for [D - 2] (+ 1
/ 2 full Ranks) magical damage. It has a TMR of 10 and an Initiative
of 30 (+ 2 / Rank). It may not be stunned. At Rank 15, every target
must make a fear check upon first being struck. The Nightmare may move
in any direction without restriction, including through air, walls,
water, etc.\ except through the area of an Illusion Special
counterspell.  If concentration is lost, the Nightmare will attempt to
kill as many people as possible, and can not be controlled by any
means.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[R-1]{Illusionary Aura}

\range{5 feet}
\duration{1 day + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{30\% + 3\% per Rank}
\target{Entity}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{None}
\begin{effects}
This ritual creates an Illusion to alter the Aura of the target.  The
target's apparent Aura is altered by fooling the DA, DE or Divination
with a stereotype defined in Rank + 1 words, \eg Rank 4 - ``Master
Thatcher and Evil Necromancer''. The questioner then receives
appropriate answers based on the stereotype; if the question is not
covered by the stereotype, the real answer is returned. The Illusory
Aura will not hide information, merely alter it. The Ritual of Warding
is not affected.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-2]{Illusionary Terrain}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{2 hours + 2 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{MA + 3\% per Rank}
\target{Area}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{None}
\begin{effects}
This ritual creates an Illusion such that observers outside the range
can not sense any sign of entities or their trappings within the area.
Temporary campsites will not be seen and permanent dwellings appear
deserted and dilapidated. However, some effects may be seen, \eg the
smoke and light of a campfire rising above the ritual's range.  The
ritual will not hide entities from each other if both are outside the
effect, even if the area lies between them. Magic that is not targeted
on entities or their possessions may not be hidden through this
ritual.  Any Location or Scrying magic lower than the Rank of
Illusionary Terrain may not detect into the ritual's area.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-3]{Permanency}

\range{5 feet}
\duration{Permanent}
\multiple{550}
\basechance{MA + 2\% per Rank}
\target{Spell or Ritual}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{Special}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can make any one of their own Illusion spells or rituals
permanent. The Illusion must have sufficient duration to last
throughout the ritual. Once an Illusion has been made permanent, no
changes are possible. The Illusion may be overridden by any similar
spell for the duration, rather than queueing. Ingredients costing
5,000sp (- 200 / Rank) are consumed upon success or backfire. The
ritual is removable by a Ritual of Dissipation or the Adept's own
Special Knowledge counterspell.
\end{effects}

\textbf{Traditional Colours:} The more flamboyant of the Illusionists will
often wear bright, even garish clothing incorporating as many colours
as possible. These colours will usually not clash, but the Illusionist
wearing them will stand out in any crowd. At the very least, most
Illusionists will wear extremes of colours; fire, blood, sable, snow,
charcoal, emerald, gold, etc.

\textbf{Traditional Symbols:} The College of Illusions is associated with a
plethora of symbols adopted from individual performers. Theatrical
symbology is common.


\textbf{On Illusions:} Most Magics in this College are Illusions.
Illusions cannot be ``disbelieved''; the images are there and will
interact with light and sound in the same manner as the objects they
represent. Mirrors and light sources may not be created. Unless
stated, the Illusions will not be substantial, and any solid objects
or spells will pass through them. Illusions will interact with each
other as if real. Illusion spells may be dispelled by anyone with the
appropriate counterspell, although Illusions on an entity gains their
passive magic resistance.

range must either resist or be blinded for 5 seconds (+ 5 / 2 full

they move at half their normal TMR. The Adept is normally not affected
by this spell.

This Talent allows the Adept to see though any obscurement such as
smoke, dust, water, fog, cloud or rain (though not darkness) to a
distance of 10 feet + 10 / Rank) as if unobscured. Normal penalties
then accrue from this point. The Adept has a base chance of PC + 5\% /
Rank of seeing invisible, as per the Witchsight talent; and of
detecting Illusions, if they take a pass action. This may only be
attempted once. Detecting an Illusion does not nullify its effects.

This spell creates the Illusion of one small object. The object will
have the physical attributes of one of the following: cloth, leather,
wood, bronze; to a maximum of 1 lb (+ 1 / 3 full Ranks). The object
will be of a single form, with no moving or removable pieces, though
of any combination of colours. The object will interact normally with
its surrounds. The workmanship is as if the Adept were an Artisan of
one-third Rank.

only fixed point in a changing world. These (far more dangerous)
Illusionists use people's dependency on their senses to cause death
and despair.

\textbf{Traditional Colours:} The more flamboyant of the Illusionists
will often wear bright, even garish clothing incorporating as many
colours as possible. These colours will usually not clash, but the
Illusionist wearing them will stand out in any crowd. At the very
least, most Illusionists will wear extremes of colours; fire, blood,
sable, snow, charcoal, emerald, gold, etc.

\textbf{Traditional Symbols:} The College of Illusions is associated
with a plethora of symbols adopted from individual
performers. Theatrical symbology is common.

\textbf{On Illusions:} Most Magics in this College are
Illusions. Illusions cannot be ``disbelieved''; the images are there and
will interact with light and sound in the same manner as the objects
they represent. Mirrors and light sources may not be created. Unless
stated, the Illusions will have no tactile qualities and any solid
objects or spells will pass through them. Illusions will interact with
each other as if real. Illusion spells may be dispelled by anyone with
the appropriate counterspell.
d26 21

\textbf{Magical Aptitude:} The MA requirement for becoming an Adept of
the College of Illusions is 13.

observer is intent on the Adept (e.g., in conversation with) the
observer may make a (2 \x PC) - Rank check to notice.  For all
purposes the Rank of the spell cannot exceed the Rank of this Talent.
In addition, the Base Chance of the spell is further reduced by
d94 1
d101 6
a106 5
smoke, dust, water, fog, cloud or rain (but not darkness) to a
distance of 10' + 10' per Rank. The Adept has a base chance of PC +
5\% per Rank of seeing unseen, blended or invisible objects, or of
detecting Illusions, if they take a pass action. Detecting an Illusion
in no way nullifies its effects.
d109 1
d116 13

Invisible as per (G-4) except that the ability to attack in melee is
not gained at Rank 16. The image takes a pulse to form (over the
Adept). The image will reflect the current appearance of the Adept, in
any desired stance. The image may only be moved (at the Adept's TMR)
when the Adept takes a pass action. The image must remain in line of
sight and within 15 feet (+ 15 feet / Rank), and may not pass through
solid objects.

Special abilities are gained at higher Ranks. At Rank 5, the image may
make appropriate environmental noises, eg; foot-steps. At Rank 10, the
Adept may move while maintaining the relative distance and direction
to their image. At Rank 15, the Adept may project their voice through
the image. At Rank 20, the Illusionist may also see through the
image. The abilities gained at Ranks 15 and 20 require pass actions to
use.

The Adept may change the taste, appearance and smell of up to one

create (Rank - 10) pounds of food or drink. This magically created
food will recover fatigue for the duration of the spell (i.e., at the
end of the spell the regained fatigue goes away).  The quality of food
is the lesser of (Adept's Cooking Rank + 2) and (Rank / 2 of this

rock. At each of Ranks 4, 8, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19 and 20, another image
may be chosen. The Adept may select the colouring, size and stance of
the image at cast time (eg; a closed iron chest, or an open wooden
casket). The Illusion does not interact with other Illusions, and is
not affected by physical laws except that it is opaque to light. The
Adept may move or rotate (though not manipulate) the Illusion by
taking a pass action. The quality of detail and realism as is they

images. The image can vary in size and shape from the object by up to
50\%, as long as neither is less than one inch square. The object may
be moved without disrupting this Illusion, but it will be dissipated
if an object is broken. One image may seem to change its appearance,
though not position, in each pulse that the Adept takes a pass

searchers get a (2 \x PC) - Rank check to notice. Items within the
pockets may not be located by lower-ranked Locate spells. The pockets

Adept casts an Illusion, they must decide whether everyone can

circumvent any resistance checks by the targets. The Illusion must be

This Illusion changes the mien of one Entity + one additional Entity
per four full Ranks. It influences the initial reactions of all
entities who perceive the target: they will react as if the target is
an innocent (this does not necessarily mean a favourable reaction).
The spell does not force people to act stupidly - if the target does
not act appropriately, their opinion may be revised rapidly. Extreme
behaviour terminates these effects. For example, should the target
prepare a weapon, cast a passively resistible spell, or attack, the
spell will dissipate.

The target has effectively been transported into a hedge-maze of
perpetual fog, where they may wander as they will. The hex that they
occupied is filled with opaque mist that disperses in 5 seconds. At
the end of the spell, the target reappears in their original hex (they
are displaced by solids but displace fluids); any items dropped inside
the maze reappear along with the target. Whilst in the maze, they must
make a 2 \x Willpower check each pulse to perform a non-pass
action. Personal magical effects continue, eg; while a Phantasm would
follow the target into the maze, Nightmares wouldn't. For all
purposes, the Maze is deemed to be on the same plane that the target
just disappeared from. Each target appears within their own unique
Maze. The Adept may still see (and thus cast upon) the target, but not
physically contact them.

detail no finer than one foot in size. The visibility in this mist is
normally 30 feet (six hexes), but may be reduced to 20 feet - 1 foot

may not be stunned and has a TMR of 10. At Rank 15, every target must
make a fear check upon first being struck. The Nightmare may move in
any direction without restriction, including through air, walls,
water, etc., except through the area of an Illusion Special
counterspell.  If a Illusion Special Counterspell is cast on the area
of the Nightware then it is dissipated.  If concentration is lost, the
Nightmare will attempt to kill as many people as possible, and can not
be controlled by any means.

This ritual creates an Illusion to obscure the Aura of the target. The
target's apparent Aura is altered by fooling the DA or DE with a
stereotype defined in Rank + 1 words. eg; Rank 4 -- ``Evil Elven
Necromancer without Necrosis''. The questioner then receives
appropriate answers based on their perception of the stereotype; if
the question is not covered by the stereotype, the real answer is
returned. The Rituals of Warding and Divination are not affected.

can not sense any sign of Entities or their trappings within this
range. Temporary campsites will not be seen and permanent dwellings
appear deserted. However, some effects will be seen, eg; the smoke and
light of a campfire may be seen above the ritual's range. The ritual
will not hide Entities from each other if both are outside the effect,
even if the area lies between them. Magic that is not targeted on
Entities may not be hidden through this ritual. Any Location or
Scrying magic lower than the Rank of Illusionary Terrain may not
detect into the ritual's area.

changes are possible.  The permanent Illusion is regarded as reality
by other Illusions and may be overridden by a similar Illusion rather
than stacking or queuing.  Ingredients costing 5,000sp (-200sp per
Rank) are consumed upon success or backfire. The ritual is removable
by a Ritual of Dissipation or the Adept's own Special counterspell.

\subsection{Conversion \& Magic Costs}

Conversion from the current Illusion College will be non-intuitive.
The structure has undergone a radical change, and there is no easy
conversion between the old and new Colleges.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Any Illusionist may change College at this point, as the old College
has been destroyed.  Up to half of their magic EP can be transferred
to the College of their choice.

\item
Existing Ranks in Enhanced Vision, Project Image, Flash of Light,
Counterspells, Purification, Aura and Permanency remain constant.

\item
Audile, Seeming \& Static Illusions must all have at least half the
Rank of their old equivalents (Visual for the latter two).

\item
Ranks in the old Ritual of Fog may be converted into equal Ranks in
either the new Ritual of Fog or the Ritual of Covering.

\item
Ranks in the Detect Illusion Talent may be converted to equal ranks in
the Concealed Casting Talent if so desired, or the EP spent on other
Talents, or (with no MA discount) on General Spells.

\item
All new General Magics can be learnt within a two week refresher
course. EP spent on Visual, Olfactory \& Tactile Illusions and
Sensation may be respent on any General Knowledge Spells, excluding
Flash of Light. The time cost will be ignored. Note that (with the MA
discount reversed), EP may be put aside for Special Knowledge Spells
\& Rituals.

\item
EP \& Time spent on Programme Illusion, Record Aura and the 26
combination Illusions will be refunded, to be spent on Special
Knowledge Spells and Rituals. These will need to be paid for and
learnt normally once all General Magics are known.

\item
Any specially acquired spells should go through a vetting process to
ensure that they fit into the new flavour of the College.  All
conversion problems will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis by
Andrew Withy. All conversions should be independently checked and
counter-signed by your next GM and Andrew Withy (366-6094).

\textbf{Traditional Colours:}
The more flamboyant of the Illusionists will often wear bright, even
garish clothing incorporating as many colours as possible. These
colours will usually not clash, but the Illusionist wearing them will
stand out in any crowd. At the very least, most Illusionists will wear
extremes of colours; fire, blood, sable, snow, charcoal, emerald,
gold, etc.

\textbf{Traditional Symbols:}
The College of Illusions is associated with a plethora of symbols
adopted from individual performers. Theatrical symbology is common.

\textbf{On Illusions:}
Most Magics in this College are Illusions. Illusions cannot be
``disbelieved''; the images are there and will interact with light and
sound in the same manner as the objects they represent. Mirrors and
light sources may not be created. Unless stated, the Illusions will
have no tactile qualities and any solid objects or spells will pass
through them. Illusions will interact with each other as if
real. Illusion spells may be dispelled by anyone with the appropriate
counterspell.

is based on, given that it has a close bond with the Adept, as a

no more than Rank inches. No Entity can fit into a pocket. The total
weight held may not exceed one lb + one lb per two Ranks, and no
individual object can weigh more than half this amount. The pockets
are not obvious to casual searchers, but thorough investigation may
find them - they get a (2 \x PC - Rank) check to notice. Any item
within a pocket does not affect encumbrance. Items within the pockets
may not be located by lower-ranked Locate spells. The pockets may only
be accessed while the Adept is clothed; however, a new set of clothes
will still contain the pockets. At the end of the spell, all items are
expelled from the pockets before they disappear.

Disguise. At Rank 10 the target's voice may be disguised. A convincing
disguise of gender is possible at Rank 15. An individual may be
imitated given sufficient study, or the target's race may be altered

Adept's whim. An Illusion with a non-entity target will only be
perceived by the targets of this spell. This does not circumvent
resistance checks by the targets. If this spell is cast multiple
times, a large number of targets may be affected by the next Illusion.

This spell places an Illusion over one Entity + one additional Entity
per four full Ranks. Anything said by the Entities will be interpreted
in the most innocent light (within reason and past
history). Optionally, the Entities' armour may look like clothes and
their weapons may look like harmless items. Should an Entity prepare a
weapon, cast a resistable spell, undergo a search, attack or be
attacked, the spell will dissipate on them. The spell will overlay
incongruous noises (eg; armour) with other background noises of equal
volume.

\subsubsection{Spell of Mist (S-11)}
d596 8

The Adept conjures 1000 cubic feet of mist + 500 feet per Rank of any
shape entirely within the Adept's range. The mist must be at least one
foot in any dimension and may have detail no finer than one foot in
size. The visibility in this mist is normally 30 feet (six hexes), but
may be reduced to six hexes minus one per four full Ranks; however
this requires concentration. If the wind is stronger that a light
breeze, the Adept must concentrate to maintain the mist. This spell is
identical to the Air College spell of the same name.

commands until the Adept's active concentration is broken or the
Nightmare is slain or dissipated. The Nightmare is totally
insubstantial and invisible to all who resist. The Nightmare has a
combined EN and FT of 20 (+ 5 per 2 full Ranks), but no defence or
armour. It can automatically hit up to two different targets a pulse
for [D - 2] + 1 / 2 full Ranks magical damage. Its Initiative is 30 +
2 / Rank. It may not be stunned and has a TMR of 10. At Rank 15, all
within 5' who failed to resist it must make a fear check. The
Nightmare may move in any direction without restriction, including
through air, walls, water, etc. except through the area of an Illusion
Special counterspell. If concentration is lost, the Nightmare will
attempt to kill as many people as possible, and can not be controlled
by any means.

\emph{Effects:}
This Illusion creates the sound of musical instruments. One instrument
+ one instrument per 3 full ranks may be played. Each instrument may
appear to play from a different point. The quality of sound for each
instrument is the lower of the Adept's rank in playing the instrument
and half Rank. Active Concentration is required for musical
per-formance at a skill level above Rank 0.

Adept may change the answer to one DA or DE question plus one question
per two full Ranks, plus whatever other answers are required to
maintain minimal consistency. For example; If Hellfire was the
target's highest ranked spell, changing ``Rank in Hellfire'' would
alter ``highest Rank in any spell'' and ``name of highest ranked
spell'' but would not change ``College of Magic''. A question may not
be changed to or from ``No Answer''. The Rituals of Warding and
Divination are not affected, but do not detect which answers have been
altered.

concentration is possible. The Illusion may be overridden by any
similar spell for the duration, rather than queuing. Ingredients
costing 5,000sp (- 200sp per Rank) are consumed upon success or
backfire. The ritual is removable by a Ritual of Dissipation or the
Adept's own Special counterspell.


\subsection{Guild Integration}

Conversion from the current Illusion College will be
non-intuitive. The structure has undergone a radical change, and there
is no bijection between most pieces of the old and new Colleges.

\subsection{Notes on Illusion}

\subsubsection{Visual Illusions}
Visual Illusions work under the following restrictions:
{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item
Mirrors and light sources may not be created. Light can not pass
through an Illusion, or shine within it. It will cast shadows.
 
\item
Illusions are opaque.

\item
Only that which has been seen can be created with any verisimilitude.

\item
They have no tactile reality --- they don't prevent movement, emit or
block heat, stop or cause damage, or support weight.

\item
They will ignore damage as well --- except Animal, Multiple Image \&
Nightmare.

\item
Fine detail and control is gained only at higher Ranks.

\item
Artistic merit or skill is not generated by Illusions, but by the
Adept.
\end{enumerate}}

Simple Visual Illusions
{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item	Illusionary Animal
\item	Illusion of Multiple Images
\item	Projected Image
\item	Illusionary Rock
\item	Static Illusion
\item	Illusionary Wall
\end{itemize}}

Attached Visual Illusions
{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item	Illusion of Food Creation
\item	Illusion of Metamorphosis
\item	Illusion of Seeming
\item	Ritual of Illusionary Terrain
\end{itemize}}

These are Visual Illusions targeted on real objects. They are more
powerful than Disguise Illusions, in that they will hide that which is
real and create that which is not. This may lead to obvious
contradictions, especially with objects moving through confined
spaces. However, these spells do not allow the control and finesse of
Disguise Illusions.

Disguise Illusions
{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item	Ritual of Illusionary Aura
\item	Ritual of Illusionary Covering
\item	Illusion of Deep Pockets
\item	Disguise Illusion
\item	Illusion of Innocence
\end{itemize}}

The Disguise category of Illusions subtly change the appearance of
real objects. They create a web of subtle alterations to colouring and
shadowing. They work better with an existing deception. They do not
affect the shape of the target, make anything invisible or add that
which is not there. This leads to a strong consistency with reality,
making these spells harder to detect. Disguise prevents low-ranked
location of the Entity; Deep Pockets, location of carried items.

Damaging Visual Illusions
{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item	Illusionary Bolt
\item	Nightmare Illusion
\end{itemize}}

These spells work like normal Visual Illusions, except that they
affect entities or objects physically.

\subsubsection{``Real'' Illusions}

{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item	Audile Illusion
\item	Minor Illusion
\item	Illusionary Orchestra
\end{itemize}}

These Illusions are effectively real, except that they can be
counterspelled, by casting a counterspell which includes one source of
the sounds in its area of effect. Only Minor Illusion generates a
Visual Illusion.

{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item	Normal Magics
\item	Flash of Light Spell 
\item	Ritual of Fog
\item	Spell of Hallucination
\item	Spell of Heroism
\item	Spell of Invisibility
\item	Maze Spell
\item	Spell of Mist
\item	Ritual of Permanency
\end{itemize}}

These spells and rituals should be treated like the magics of any
other college.

\subsubsection{Auras}

No Illusion other than Aura allows the obscurement or change of the
target's aura beyond the normal impact of a spell. Either the real
object or the Illusion may be targeted, with the object being the
default target.

\subsubsection{Stacking}
Illusions are subject to the same stacking and queuing rules as any
other magic. The only exception to this is Permanent Illusion. These
Illusions become the new base reality that other Illusions work
from. For example, a Human permanently disguised as an Elf could not
be disguised as a Human below Rank 20, though they could be disguised
as an Elf.

{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item
Heroism does not stack with Armour of Earth, Enchanted Armour,
Shadowform, Strength of Darkness, Strength of Stone, Waters of
Strength, Wraithcloak or other spells affecting PS, FT, defence, stun
or fear checks. It does stack with talents.

\item
Disguise and
Metamorphosis do not stack.

\item
Terrain and Covering do not stack.

\item
Mist and Fog do not stack.
\end{itemize}}

\subsubsection{College Overlaps}

{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item
Invisibility is identical to the E\&E spell of the same name,
excluding Base Chance.

\item	Mist is identical to Air's Conjuring Mist,
except that it is Special Knowledge.

\item
Orchestra is identical to the proposed Bardic Ethereal Orchestra,
except that it is Special Knowledge.

\item
Static Illusion is identical to Rune's Illusion.

\item
Minor Illusion is a weakened version of Binder's Minor Creation.

\item
Nightmare is similar to Necromancy's Spectral Warrior, altered for
mass effect and fear.

\item
Wall will work as any other wall spell, except for damage, solidity
and fear.
\end{itemize}}

\subsubsection{Adept's Styles}

There are three major styles of Illusionist. These are Pure Illusion,
Deception and Combat. We suggest a selection of spells particularly
appropriate for each style:
{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\setlength\leftmarginii{1.0em}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pure Illusion
\begin{itemize}
\item Audile
\item Covering
\item Minor Illusion
\item Seeming
\item Static
\item Wall
\end{itemize}

\item Deception
\begin{itemize}
\item Aura
\item Deep Pockets
\item Disguise
\item Innocence
\item Invisibility
\item Terrain
\end{itemize}

\item Combat
\begin{itemize}
\item Bolt
\item Flash of Light 
\item Heroism
\item Maze
\item Multiple Images
\item Nightmare
a768 37
\end{itemize}}

\subsubsection{Tips}

{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\setlength\leftmarginii{1.0em}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Casting Seeming on a Static or Minor Illusion will allow some
movement, as with a real object.

\item 
Illusions can not be made invisible --- only other Illusions treat them
as real.  Remember all Illusions treat each other as real. An
Illusionary Animal may stand on Illusions, but may not pass through
them. A Metamorphed entity may not. However, a Metamorphed Illusionary
Animal can.

\item 
Mirrors can play havoc with Flash of Light - shut your eyes when you
cast.  Don't create clothing in a Disguise that you plan to use for a
long time.  Don't go around counterspelling Illusions without very
good reason. It is impolite, and can be returned in kind.

\item 
Remember that Illusions are as powerful as any other College ---
devastating in their element, weak or irrelevant elsewhere. Illusions
specialise in deception.  If in doubt, go with common sense and the
spirit of the descriptions, not the exact wording.

\item 
Illusion is still intended to allow creative flair, as a performance
College. Allow Best Dramatic Effect.

\item 
All stage magic except ESP is possible with this College.
