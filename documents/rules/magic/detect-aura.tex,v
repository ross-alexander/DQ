\section{Names \& Auras}

In the DQ universe entities have an Aura. Those objects that were once
alive retain traces of their living auras.  The strength and
composition of the Aura reflects the amount of life-force and magic
that the entity or object possesses and the other properties that are
intrinsically part of their being.

The base element of any Aura is strength. The strength of an Aura is
always revealed by any magic that detects or reads Auras. The
categories of strength are, from weakest to strongest:
\begin{Enumerate}
\item Magic (magical wall, illusion)
\item Formerly Living Composite (chair, stew)
\item Formerly Living (dead orc, log)
\item Non-Sentient Animates (stone golem, skeleton)
\item Living Plants (rose, oak)
\item Living Animals (dog, cat)
\item Sentient Animates (flesh golem, vampire)
\item Living Sentient (human, sphinx)
\item Long Living Sentient (dragon, titan, elf)
\item Avatar (material form of a Demon, etc.)
\end{Enumerate}
The strongest Aura will be detected. Thus a human covered by an
illusion (without an Aura component) will still be detectable as a
Living Sentient.

The rest of an Aura consists of information intrinsic to the
possessor. This information will vary depending upon the Generic type
of the target, but will either affect the life-force of the target, or
be magical. Only effects that are still current or continuos in nature
will be detected.  Information may be gained in descriptive terms,
values or even proportions as appropriate for the type of information
being read.

Information that may be gained from a living being includes: its
Generic True Name, its plane of origin, approximately how far it is
through its life-span (\eg juvenile, 50\%, about 100 years old), its
general state of health (\eg healthy, diseased, 1/2 Endurance),
aptitude with a magical ability (\eg low overall, Rank of specific
ability) and to which College of magic (if any) it is attuned. These
last two facts are discernible because the skills that they represent
have an affect on the level and type of magic in the entity's
Aura. Relatively little information can be divined regarding the
non-magical learned abilities of an entity. It will be possible to
learn what is the being's most intrinsic skill or ability, but lesser
skills may not be sufficiently intrinsic so as to have made an
impression on the being's aura.

Magical auras will include information such as College, exact name of
a spell or other effect, level of magical ability (low, medium, high,
very high), approximate length of time that the magic has been in
effect (providing it is still present), and approximately how much
duration remains.

Any one part of an object will be representative of the entire object,
for example the Aura of a toe sticking out from underneath a blanket
will reveal the same information as if the entire being were
visible. A detached thumb could reveal some information about its
former owner, up to the time it was detached, providing it is
intrinsic to the thumb, for example Generic True Name, plane of
origin, or age --- when it was removed.  The thumb would not reveal a
magical college or a skill, as these are properties of living beings
only.

\subsection{Detect Aura Talent}
\label{magic:detect-aura}
\index{detect aura}

\begin{talent}{Detect Aura}

\range{Special}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{Perception (\x 2 for Namers) + 5\% / Rank 
- 1\% for every foot after the first five feet the target is 
from Adept}
\resist{Active}
\target{Entity, Object, Area, Volume}
\begin{effects}
If the talent is successful the Adept learns which of the aura
categories they are seeing (with the strongest taking precedence), and
optionally learns the answer to one question of the Adept's choice
about the target. The answer to a DA question will consist of a single
concept or "bit" of information. If the information sought is not
intrinsic to the target the Adept will receive no answer. It is not
possible to determine the Individual True Name of an entity. If the
Adept achieves a double or triple effect, the Adept may ask the GM two
or three questions respectively. The process of reading an aura and
asking a question entails concentration on the part of an Adept and
requires a magical Pass action.  Re-reading a previously seen aura, or
learning the category of the aura without asking a question may be
combined with other actions, as for other talents.

Only one attempt at Detect Aura may be made per object. An individual
object will change over time, however, and a fresh attempt may be made
when the aura has changed sufficiently to class it as a ``new'' object.
If an aura has been successfully read, the same information will be
available without a new Cast Check being made, until such time that
the object changes sufficiently to be considered a ``new'' object.

Aura require direct line of sight to be read.  It is not possible to
use Detect Aura through a mirror, crystal ball, Wizard's Eye, or by
any other indirect means.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{Interpretation and Examples}

\begin{Enumerate}
\item
In general the more specific the question the more 
specific the answer - the exact nature is left to the GM's 
discretion. For example:
\begin{Itemize}
\item ``What was the last type of magic to impact on this person?''
might get ``A spell''.

\item ``What is the nature of the most recent magical affect on 
this perso''?" might get ``fortitude''.

\item ``What was the last spell to impact on this person?'' might 
get ``Strength of Stone''. 
\end{Itemize}

\item
All things change over time, even if outwardly they look the
same. While the times may vary from object to object depending on
circumstances, they tend to follow a seasonal cycle following the
seasons. An object whose aura was read in Spring will have changed
sufficiently by Summer to be able to be DAed again.

\item
The single attempt rule also applies to multi-hex objects. Only one DA
may be performed per item --- one cannot DA a wooden floor three times
just because it covers 3 hexes. Attempts to do so will get the
response (even before rolling the dice) - ``you see an aura, formerly
living, and the answer is oak'', that is the same aura they had
previously read until a change of season. After the change of season a
new attempt to detect the aura would have to be made.

\item
Once an aura has been detected, it is available to the detector for
the looking, as is the answer to the question/s asked, until the aura
changes. For example, having detected the Aura of a Ward, the Adept is
able to re-read the same information freely. If the Ward was then
dissipated, the aura would vanish.

\item
A DQ aura is located very close to the skin surface.  Thus a person in
a full suit of plate armour, with the visor down, and no part of the
body visible whatsoever would not be able to have their aura
read. Cloth will hide an aura, but make up will not.

\item
The size of the object will be determined by its utility. Thus 100' of
corridor could be a single object, while the next 5 feet, because it
has a wooden floor, or is magical say, may be an object. The GM may
deliberately break things up so as not to give away too much
information from the groupings chosen.
\end{Enumerate}

\subsection{True Names}

\label{names}
\index{true names}
\index{true names!generic}

\subsubsection{Generic True Names}

All living things in the DragonQuest world have a Generic True
Name. This name is present in their aura. Formerly living things
retain traces of their aura and the name that they had when alive. All
True Names are in an ancient language, believed by some to be the
language that the gods used when they made the world, and by others to
be the original language of the first mortal race, the Dragons. A
translation of these names into the common tongue yields such terms as
human, elf, tiger, oak, bee, rattlesnake, and rose.

A Generic True name identifies the entity or object as being of a
distinct type. Very similar things with much the same form and
function, will probably have the same Generic name. For example, many
small, harmless, plains-dwelling snakes will have the Generic True
name ``Grass Snake'' even if they look somewhat different. A venomous
variety of similar nature will have a different Generic True name.
Generic True Names may be learnt:
\begin{Itemize}
\item By means of a Detect Aura.

\item From another being who has studied the name (\eg knows the name
at Rank 0 or higher).
\end{Itemize}

\subsubsection{Individual True Names}

\index{true names!individual}

All sentient entities (player character races, dragons, mer-people,
naga, etc.) have an Individual True Name. This becomes known to them
upon reaching maturity. All sane sentient entities will know their own
Individual True Name and no force --- physical or magical --- can coerce
the entity to reveal it. They may choose to reveal it, however.  An
entity will be called by a given (or use) name, often given to then by
parents or peers. The entity will know their Individual True Name in
their native tongue and a Namer would have to spend time translating
the Individual Name into the Namer language before it could be used.
Entities will protect their True Name vigorously as this knowledge can
be used both defensively and offensively.  Indeed, the very mention of
an entity's True Name would strike great fear into their heart.

Player characters and even members of the College of Naming
Incantations will know only their own Individual True Name upon
completing their education. All other Individual True Names must be
acquired and learnt before they can be used.  Four methods exist for
acquiring an entity's True Name:

\begin{Itemize}
\item The entity may choose to reveal it.

\item It may be obtained from a Namer Demon --- when an entity is born,
their Individual True Name becomes known to some of the Naming Demons
(see the demon descriptions in the College of Greater Summoning).

\item It may be obtained from another other being who has studied the
True Name, if they choose to disclose it.

\item It may be found in written form --- Adepts of various Colleges
have been known to record important entity's names in magic tomes.
\end{Itemize}

The aura of the entity contains both the Generic and Individual True
Names, and so the training of the College of Namers concentrates
greatly on the study and interpretation of auras, from all living
beings and formerly-living objects. Whilst other Colleges use
abilities to detect auras, only the Namer is trained to make maximum
use of the information gained from perceiving auras. The Generic Name
is instantly identified when a Namer perceives an aura, although this
Name must still be studied and Ranked to be of use. The information is
coded into the aura in a form that Namers are trained to recognise,
but other Colleges, through use of the same Detect Aura spell /
talent, would need to inquire specifically to receive the same
information.

The Individual True Name is also coded into the aura, but is so
complex and varied that they cannot be deciphered and used by even a
Namer. If the Namer is given the Entity's True Name, then it is
possible for the Namer to identify the auric characteristics that make
up the Individual True Name. The study of these components takes
considerable time due to their complexity.

{\bf Note} These rules cover the detect aura talents of the Namer,
Earth and Celestial Colleges.  The Detect Aura Talent is defined, then
guide lines to its use are defined.  Finally further notes and
examples are appended for full clarification.  The general rules and
observations will apply to most detect aura magic unless specifically
stated to the contrary in the description of that magic.

All living beings have an aura.  Formerly living things retain their
name and traces of their aura.  Magic also has its own aura, but this
is weaker again.  This aura may be read by the use of magic for clues
concerning the nature of an entity or object.  Objects made of
formerly living matter will also possess an aura, but one which is
much weaker.  The following categories of auras are listed in order of
strength (weakest to strongest):
d95 10
a104 26
\begin{Enumerate}
\item Magical
\item Formerly living as part of an object
\item Formerly living (not including undead)
\item Living plants
\item Non-sentient undead and golems
\item Living animals
\item Sentient plants
\item Sentient undead and golems
\item Short-living sentient beings -- humans, dwarves, giants, etc
\item Long-living sentient beings -- dragons, elves, titans, demons, etc
\end{Enumerate}

Whenever an Adept can directly see an entity, object or area, they may
tell the GM that they are attempting to detect the being or object's
aura.  D100 is rolled.  If the result is less than or equal to the
Adept's Base Chance, the GM must tell the Adept which of the
aforementioned categories of aura they are seeing (with the strongest
taking precedence), and answer one question of the Adept's choice
about the being or object (Namers may get additional information, as
listed under that college). The question must be intrinsic to that
entity or object.  It is not possible to determine Individual True
Name of the entity.  If the dice roll falls within the span of
possible results necessary to achieve double or triple effects when
casting a spell, the Adept may ask the GM two (for double effect) or
three (for triple effect) questions.
a107 31
\subsection{General Rules and Observations}

\begin{Enumerate}
\item
The answer to a DA question will consist of a single concept or
``bit'' of information.
\item
Any one part of an object will be representative of the entire object.
\item
Only one attempt at Detect Aura may be made per object.  An individual
object will change over time, however, and a fresh attempt may be made
when the aura has changed sufficiently to class it as a ``new'' object.
\item
If an aura has been successfully read, the answer(s) to the
question(s) asked will be available without a new Cast Check being
made, until such time that the object changes sufficiently to be
considered a ``new'' object.

\item
To see an aura requires direct line of sight to the object being DAed.
It is not possible to DA through a mirror, crystal ball, or Wizard's
Eye, or by any other indirect means.

\item
Illusions do not usually provide an accompanying aura.  Thus most
illusions will have the aura of magical.

\item
In combat, a Detect Aura and question requires a pass action.
\end{Enumerate}

a110 1

d112 26
a137 38
In general the more specific the question the more specific the answer
-- the exact nature is left to the GM's discretion.

\begin{example}
``What was the last type of magic to impact on this person?''  might get
``A spell'' \\
``What is the nature of the most recent magical affect on
this person?'' might get ``fortitude'' \\
``What was the last spell to impact on this person?'' might get
``Strength of Stone'' \\
\end{example}

Note that the information must be intrinsic to that object -- a
formerly living body will not have a magical college or a skill --
those are properties of living beings only.

\item
A DA of a big toe sticking out from underneath a blanket will reveal
the same information as if the entire being were visible.  A detached
thumb could reveal some information about its former owner, up to the
time it was detached, providing it is intrinsic to the thumb, for
example generic true name, plane of origin, or age.

\item

All things change over time, even if outwardly they look the same.
While the times may vary from object to object depending on
circumstances, they tend to relate to a three month cycle following
the seasons. An object DAed in Spring will have changed sufficiently
by Summer to be able to be DAed again. Thus if the attempt at a DA
fails, any attempt to read the aura again before the object has
changed enough to be considered a ``new'' object (that is next season)
the DA will fail again.  Similarly, if the attempt succeeds, the aura
may not be detected again to ask another question, until next season.
The single attempt rule also applies to multi-hex objects.  Only one
DA may be performed per item -- one cannot DA a wooden floor three
times just because it covers 3 hexes.  Attempts to do so will get the
response (even before rolling the dice) -- ``you see an aura, formerly

previously read, which is free for the looking as per rule 4, until a
change of season.  After the change of season a new attempt to detect
the aura would have to be made.
a142 1

d144 16
a159 23
the looking, as is the answer to the question/s asked, until a change
of season.  For example Dirt the earth mage has DA'ed a volume of
space in the corridor in front of him. It reveals a magical aura in
the space, and the answer of ``Yes'' to the question ``Is this area
magically warded?''.  (Note that wards are on volumes, not areas -- if
Dirt had only DA'ed the floor he would never have seen the ward) Nonem
the Namer quickly tries a couple of counterspells. Dirt is able, for
the looking, see whether that magical aura is still in place, and its
extent (roughly).  When (or if) Nonem finds the right counterspell,
Dirt will notice a change in the aura.  In fact, the area would no
longer have an aura, indicating that the ward had been dissipated.

\item
A DQ aura is located very close to the skin surface (1 -- 2 mm).  Thus a
person in a full suit of plate armour, with the visor down, and no
part of the body visible whatsoever would not be able to have their
aura read.  Cloth will hide an aura, but make up will not.

\item
The size of the object will be determined by its utility.  Thus 100'
of corridor could be a single object, while the next 5 feet, because
it has a wooden floor, or is magical say, may be an object.  The GM
may deliberately break things up so as not to give away too much
d161 3
d165 85
a249 5
\item
Reading a previously seen aura, or simply getting the category of the
aura without asking a question may be combined with other actions, as
for other talents. The process of asking a question must entail full
concentration, and hence a pass action.

\begin{example}
Nonem is at the head of a party walking along a Black Mage's
well-guarded stone corridor.  He is checking the floor for magical
traps (central hex) every 5' and the space in front of him for wards
as they go.  Nonem's standard view is 60' ahead for checking wards (he
could have chosen 100', or any other number up to the limit of his
sight).  The scenario is something like this:

Staircase 1 is 20 steps, and wooden, Staircase 2 is 20 steps and
wooden, with a magical trap on step 11.  The party is travelling left
to right. Nonem's standard question is ``What is the Black Mage
Special Knowledge Spell in this ward/trap''.  The GM's answers
(assuming all are successful) might run like this:
\begin{flushleft}
Space: ``No aura for 60 ft'';
Floor: ``No aura 100 ft'';
Space: "Magical aura 20 ft away covering whole corridor, No answer''
(it is warded with a damnum minatum, a general knowledge spell);
Space: ``No aura next 60 ft'';
Floor: ``No aura next 40 ft'';
Floor: ``Magical aura on central hex of corridor, Hellfire'';
Space: ``No aura next 60', that is to top of stairs'';
Floor: ``next 20 ft to bottom of stair no aura'';
``First 10 steps formerly living'' (magical in any way?) ``no'',
``11th step is formerly living'' (magical in any way?) ``no";
``last 9 steps formerly living'' (magical in any way?) ``no'';

{\em Editors Note:} The Detect Aura is currently played with a much
weakened (that is not nearly as strict) version of intrinsic, for
example Callas (an Earth Mage) often asks ``Last magic to impact?''
and expects to get all magic, regardless of whether it was resisted or
not.  This should be possible since a rule change made all spells
impact upon their target, regardless of whether the target resisted or
not.  The last magic to impact is clearly separate from the last magic
to effect and both should be detectable.

{\bf Note} This covers the detect aura talents of the Namer, Earth and
Celestial Colleges.  The Detect Aura Talent is defined, then guide
lines to its use are defined.  Finally further notes and examples are
appended for full clarification.  The general rules and observations
will apply to most detect aura magic unless specifically stated to
the contrary in the description of that magic.

Whenever confronted by an object whose nature is unknown to them, the

taking precedence), and answer one question of the Adept's choice about
the being or object (Namers may get additional information, as listed
under that college). The question must be intrinsic to that entity or
object. The GM should not provide the Individual True Name of the
entity.  If the dice roll falls within the span of possible results
necessary to achieve double or triple effects when casting a spell
(see section 27), the Adept may ask the GM two (for double effect) or

The Base chance of the Detect Aura Talent is equal to the Adept's
modified Perception (twice modified Perception in the case of Namers),
modified by adding the following:

To see an aura requires line of sight to the object being DAed.

Illusions do not provide an accompanying aura.  Thus the aura of an
illusion will always be magical.

those are properties of living beings only.  A question like "Last
spell to impact on this person" is likely to provide little
information if the last spell is no longer in effect on the person,
and certainly none if the spell was resisted -- it never became
intrinsic as it never affected the person (excepting those execrable
spells that have "half damage if resist").  If the GM is uncertain of
what the character is asking, they should request clarification prior
to answering.

an answer of "no aura" would be given.  Similarly, if the attempt
succeeds, the aura may not be detected again to ask another question,
until next season.  The single attempt rule also applies to multi-hex
objects.  Only one DA may be performed per item -- one cannot DA a
wooden floor three times just because it covers 3 hexes.  Attempts to
do so will get the response (even before rolling the dice) -- ``you
see an aura, formerly living, and the answer is oak'', that is the
same aura they had previously read, which is free for the looking as
per rule 4, until a change of season.  After the change of season a
new attempt to detect the aura would have to be made.

Stair 1 is 20 steps, and wooden, Stair 2 is 20 steps and wooden, with a
magical trap on step 11.  The party is travelling left to
right. Nonem's standard question is ``What is the Black Mage Special
Knowledge Spell in this ward/trap''.  The GM's answers (assuming all
are successful) might run like this:
d198 1
a201 13
For example an elf might have a visual-tactile illusion on his person
to make him look like a human.  A DA would reveal an aura of
``long-lived sentient being'', and Generic True Name would show as
elf.  Similarly a visual illusion of a pot-plant would have a magical
aura not formerly living), and a question like age might get "15
minutes".  There has been known to be an ``illusory aura'' spell.  In
this case one could add an aura to an illusion, or change the aura of
an object without changing anything else, for example changing the
aura on a cursed gem from magical to no aura.  This illusory aura can
be disbelieved in, at the usual difficulty factor based on the rank of
the spell.

queston must entail full concentration, and hence a pass action.
