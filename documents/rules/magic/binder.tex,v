@\begin{college}[1.1]{binder}{Binding and Animating Magics}{BI}

\textbf{This College is a probationary College. This means that this
College is under trial for two years (as of April 1999). All characters
that join this College do so under the understanding that if this
College is deemed unplayable, it may be withdrawn or radically
changed. At that point, all such characters may have the EP and time
spent in this College refunded, to be re-spent freely in another
College as if that College had been their original choice.}

Members of the College of Binding and Animating Magics specialise in
the binding, manipulation and animation of non-living matter; they are
commonly known as Binders. Binders tend to be less concerned with the
theory and philosophy of magic than members of the other
Thaumaturgical Colleges, and are usually more inclined to tinker
around until something works. Binders are often accused of lacking
empathy, because of the amount of time they spend associating with
inanimate objects. However, many Binders cultivate an impish sense of
humour, which their College gives ample opportunity to develop. The
College has been cloistered until relatively recently, and it is not
well known. Much of the Binders' knowledge was lost during the Fall.
They are found almost exclusively in highly developed and civilised
areas.

Most Colleges are scornful of Binders, due to their reputations as
tricksters and their lack of direct combat magics.  They are also
mocked for their strong association with the artisan trades, such as
Carpentry, Sculpting and Smithing. Many Binders possess at least one
such skill, Mechanician, or Philosopher specialising in engineering,
architecture and the like, as all of these abilities complement the
College's mechanistic style of magic

\subsubsection{Traditional Colours}

Binders do not have traditional colours, but tend to wear practical
work clothes, usually with a leather apron anchored in place, and
bedecked with tools.

\subsubsection{Traditional Symbols}

The College's traditional symbol is that of many cogwheels, each
turning others, in an endless chain. However, the populace generally
associates the College with the Rag and String Golems that many
Binders use as followers and helpers.

\subsection{Restrictions}

A Magical Aptitude of 17 is required to join the College.  Members of
the College of Binding and Animating Magics may operate without
restriction.

\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}

The following modifiers are cumulative with all other modifiers
(including those specified in \S\ref{magic:modifiers}).

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Rituals: Per 10\% extra spent on Ritual materials & +1 \\
Spells: Per hour of Ritual Spell Preparation    & +1 \\
Per Rank in Mechanician or Philosopher    & +1 \\
\end{tabularx}

Note: Rank in Mechanician OR Philosopher may be applied, not both.

\subsection{Definitions}

\begin{Description}
\item[Assistants] An assistant may be used to provide skills or
abilities which the Binder does not possess. The assistant must be
present throughout the entire ritual. If using an assistant's skill to
craft a golem, the assistant's rank may affect the PB of the golem but
not the base chance of performing the ritual.

\item[Construction Time] Each golem type has a base construction
time. This is multiplied by the height of the golem in feet (round
up).  This assumes that the adept has the requisite quantity of
materials on hand and the tools or ability to shape the material.

\item[Crafting Golems] To perform a Shaping Golem ritual the binder
must have all of the materials on hand. They must also have the tools
and skill to shape the material, or an assistant with the appropriate
tools and skills.

\item[Magical Materials] The following statistics are for golems made
of non-magical materials. Golems made of magical, enchanted or
formerly enchanted materials are less predictable. A Binder attempting
to use enchanted materials should exercise the utmost caution. Some
golems may turn out fine, possibly even with beneficial side-effects,
others may be actively inimical.

\item[Material Costs] This is the cost for magical materials to perform
the ritual. The cost of materials for the golem itself is additional
to this.

\item[Upgrades] When an Adept increases their rank in a golem ritual
they may upgrade existing golems to their new rank. This requires the
performance of the ritual. The time required is the base time for the
golem (no matter how big it is).

\item[Weathering / Deterioration] When a golem is crafted or animated,
the magic involved does not provide any sort of protection from normal
weathering (\ie Clay will dry and crumble, cloth will get torn, wood
will rot, iron will rust, etc). Separate preservation magics may be
cast on a golem to reduce or prevent normal weathering.

\end{Description}

\subsection{Attuning Golems}

When constructing a golem, it may be attuned to certain skills or
magics. The adept may attune the golem with 1 ability (+1/Rank). Each
skill, language, weapon, talent (racial or college), spell, or ritual
counts as 1 ability. What a golem has been attuned to cannot be
changed but it can be increased when a golem is upgraded.

\subsection{Golems in Combat}
\begin{Description}
\item[Bleeding] Golems don't bleed.

\item[Damaged Golems] Golems cannot be healed, instead they must be
repaired.  A golem must have positive Endurance to be activated.

\item[Dead Golems] A golem which has been killed cannot be re-activated
until the damage is repaired and the appropriate shaping ritual is
performed, as if doing an upgrade.

\item[Fatigue Recovery] Golems always have full fatigue on activation.
They also recover 1 FT per hour while activated.

\item[Sleep and Charm] Golems do not sleep and cannot be charmed.
However, if the Binder is possessing a golem, they can be slept or
charmed by targeting the golem.

\item[Stun] Golems do not stun.

\item[Unconsciousness] If a golem's Endurance is reduced below 1 then
it deactivates.

\item[Weapon Ranks] A golem may wield weapons.  If the golem has been
attuned to a weapon then it may use that weapon at Rank 0.  If that
weapon is also built-in to the golem (or unarmed) then it will wield
the weapon at Rank (Lower of: (Rank in ritual / 2) or maximum Rank).
All other weapons will be wielded as if unranked.  Note that a golem
will not evade or attempt any special manoeuvre (\eg trip, disarm)
unless possessed by an Adept.
\end{Description}

\subsection{Golem Intellience}

Golems have an animal level intelligence. Each golem has an animal
equivalent to use as a guideline for their intelligence and
temperament when their masters' instructions are unclear, incomplete
or no longer applicable.

Golems are somewhat different from their animal equivalents.  They
have a weak survival instinct, and their strongest drive is to follow
their masters' instructions.

Golem Animal Equivalents: Clay = Ox; Rag \& String = Monkey; Iron =
Tiger; Stone = Elephant; Wood = Dog.

\subsection{Instructing Golems}

Golems must be verbally instructed.  Instructing a golem requires
active concentration.  A golem will only take instructions from its
master.  A golem will attempt to follow the nature and intent of the
Adept's instructions.

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Activate Golem}

\begin{effects}
This talent requires 1 pulse of active concentration.  It costs 2 FT
to attempt this talent which activates an inactive golem.  If the
golem is one which the Adept has constructed then the talent
automatically works; otherwise the chance of success is the Adept's
chance of creating a golem of that type.  This talent may not be
ranked.  The adept who activates a golem is considered its master.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Detect Enchantment}

\range{1. 30 feet (+ 5 / Rank)  2. Touch}
\multiple{50}
\basechance{1. PC + 3\% / Rank  2. PC + 5\% / Rank}
\begin{effects}
This talent determines whether an item, person, or area in
line-of-sight and within range is currently under an enchantment or
magical effect. The Adept can tell whether the enchantment is a
current spell or ritual, a warded, invested, or permanent effect, is
contained in a trap or is a curse. A double effect will reveal the
general nature of the spell (eg; defensive, summoning, damaging) and
the effective Rank or remaining duration of the enchantment. In
addition, a triple effect will tell the Adept the exact name of the
magic (eg; Wall of Bones, Hellfire), or the College of the spell.

Once the initial, most recent, magical effect has been successfully
detected, older enchantments on a target with multiple layers of magic
may also be detected. This may be continued while the Adept continues
to succeed in detecting Enchantments. However, only one attempt per
quarter may be made to detect any given enchantment. If a new
enchantment occurs, the Adept may attempt to detect it, though this in
no way affects the status of the old layer. If an old, unsuccessfully
detected enchantment expires, the Adept may attempt to detect any
newly revealed magic beneath it.

If the Adept is in contact with the target then the base chance of
this talent is higher.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}


\begin{spell}[G-1]{Adhesion}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{175}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The surface of a non-living solid, up to 1 cubic foot (+ 2 / Rank), is
magically enchanted to adhere to any objects coming into contact with
it. Once stuck, an object is released when the spell's duration
expires, or the applied PS + D10 exceeds the spell's PS of 10 (+ 2 /
Rank), which tears the object free (the durability of some objects may
be less than the force required to tear them free from the
spell). Several individuals may combine their PS to free an
object. Being broken free of the area of the Adhesion, or resisting a
particular contact, in no way protects the object from becoming stuck
if brought into contact with the affected area again; nor is the spell
in any way broken by having an object torn away; the area remains as
adhesive as before. Except for the crowding of the area, there is no
limit to the number of objects that may be stuck with this spell. The
chance of a person coming into contact with an adhesive portion of a
hex is 10\% / Rank applied to that hex.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Animating Objects}

\range{10 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell may be used to animate any one object, of up to 10 pounds
(+ 10 / Rank) in weight. By taking a pass action the Adept may control
the actions of 1 (+ 1 / Rank) previously controlled animates within
range. Once set in motion, the animates will attempt to carry out the
action until ordered otherwise. The animates will move about in a
manner applicable to their shape. Their TMR will not exceed 4.

Animates have a nominal PS value of 5 (+ 1 / Rank) though this will
have limited effect on objects made of flimsy materials.  Their strike
chance will be no more than 20\% (+2\% / Rank), with a maximum of D+2
damage. The animate will cease to function if the object is destroyed,
or a Binder General Knowledge Counterspell is cast on it. An animate
is an object, but may also be targeted as an Entity. If an animate is
created through the use of a Ward or Magical Trap, it will receive one
command determined when first cast.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Bound Speech}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 day + 1 day / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{None}
\target{Object, Area of Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell allows the Adept to record a verbal message in an object,
and defines the conditions under which the message will be
replayed. This spell operates in most respects similarly to the Ward
ritual, except that the range is the range of this spell or touch, and
a message is stored instead of a spell. The message is replayed
exactly as the Adept recorded it, and may contain any verbalisations
that the Adept is capable of. The message may not exceed 5 words (+ 3
words / Rank). Unlike the Ward ritual, the message may be triggered
one additional time per two full Ranks.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Durability}

\range{10 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
One object weighing up to 2 pounds (+ 2 / Rank) may be made more
resilient and less susceptible to damage.  The item becomes almost as
strong as steel of the same thickness, without losing any flexibility.
The item cannot be broken unless exposed to stresses beyond that which
steel could withstand, given the object's size and shape.  The
strength is improved with rank to a maximum of slightly stronger than
steel.

This spell does not protect against soiling, corrosion or fire or any
forms of damage other than physical stress.

A weapon treated with this spell allows the wielder to add 2\% per
Rank of the spell to any roll to save the weapon from breaking.
Armour protected by this spell will have 2 extra Protection ( + 1 / 10
full ranks) to a maximum of the equivalent Steel armour.  At Rank 20,
1 may be added to this maximum.

Note that the added Protection replaces (rather than adds to) any
other Protection bonuses due to a material's strength (eg Armourer
bonuses).  If the item is broken, or armour suffers damage from a
Specific Grievous, the magic is dispelled.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Mending}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Parts of an Object, Golem}
\begin{effects}
Any single object weighing up to 10 pounds (+ 10 / Rank), or one
Golem, can be mended. A mended object becomes exactly as it was before
it was broken or deformed. Any pieces missing when the spell is cast
will remain missing when the object is mended. Mending used to fix
objects with an effective Artisan Rank greater than that the Adept
possesses will degrade the object's effective rank. Magical items made
mundane through breaking will remain mundane even after the use of a
Mending. The Spell of Mending may be used on a living creature that
has been transformed into stone, and subsequently broken. This
requires that the Binder be a Sculptor of at least Rank 8. A Spell of
Mending may be used to repair Golems. It may repair either a Specific
Grievous injury, or all general Endurance damage.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Modify Aura}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object, Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell allows the Adept to able to modify the aura strength of any
one object or entity. The target object may be up to 20 cubic feet (+
20 / Rank).The strength of the aura increases or decreases by up to 1
+ (1 / 4 Ranks) on the table below. This spell does not alter the
target's aura in any other way.

\begin{tabular}{cl}
\textbf{Aura} & \textbf{Equivalent} \\
0    & No Aura \\
1    & Magic \\
2    & Formerly living as part of an object \\
3    & Formerly living \\
4    & Living plants \\
5    & Non-sentient Undead / Construct \\
6    & Living animals \\
7    & Sentient plant \\
8    & Sentient Undead / Construct \\
9    & Short-living Sentient \\
10   & Long-living Sentient \\
15   & Avatar \\
\end{tabular}
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Minor Creation}

\range{Touch}
\duration{15 minutes + 15 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may create a simple, common object from a larger source of
its constituent substances by reaching into the source and withdrawing
the object. For example, the Adept may reach into a tree and produce a
staff. One (+ 1 / 5 full Ranks) different substances may be combined
into a single finished object with this spell. The substance sources
are in no way damaged or reduced by the spell. The created object will
be a common example of its type and may not exceed 1 cubic foot (+ 1
per Rank) in volume, nor 1 lb (+ 1 lb / Rank) in weight. The object is
physically real with all normal attributes. The object may not be
created enclosed by or enclosing anything. Complicated or fine quality
objects may not be created without the appropriate artisan skill. No
alchemical, herbal or other quasi-magical objects may be
created. Created food provides no sustenance.  At the end of its
duration the item vanishes.  The object is a magical construct and
will have a magical aura, regardless of its constituent materials.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Moulding Elements}

\range{30 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
A volume of up to 2 cubic feet (+ 2 / Rank) containing one of the four
material Elements (air, water, earth, fire) can be moulded by the
Adept into any form desired, and will retain that form for the
duration of the spell. The Adept must immediately mould the element
into the correct shape with their hands. During this time the Adept is
protected from the effects of the element, which is as malleable as
putty. The time taken to mould the element is dependent on the size
and complexity of the object desired, but will be at least a
pulse. After the initial moulding, the element will retain its shape,
unless something disrupts it, when it will immediately attempt to
reform, possibly around or on top of the impedance. The shaped element
will have a defined boundary and shape, but will not be rigid
(excluding shaped earth). The spell cannot be cast over any
entity. The Adept may use applicable artisan skills to shape an object
of greater than Rank 0 quality. Once the spell expires the element
will act normally according to its substance, shape, and natural laws.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9]{Preservation}

\range{5 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Ward, Investment, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume, a dead / undead Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell preserves and protects one animate, dead or undead entity,
of up to 100 pounds (+ 100 / Rank) or a collection of small objects of
a total weight not greater than 1 pound (+ 1 / Rank) against the
effects of time, decay, rust, erosion or wave action. It does not
confer any protection against magical attacks. It will not suspend
time with regard to resurrection, poisons, curses, etc. Duration is 4
(+ Rank squared) days, but is permanent at Rank 20.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-10]{Transparency}

\range{10 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{175}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
This spell causes a volume of non-living solid material to become as
transparent as high quality glass, but to otherwise retain its
original characteristics. One (+ 1 / Rank) adjacent 1 foot cubes may
be affected. The Adept may cause the volume to be transparent from
only a single direction, by reducing the BC by 10.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}


\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Linking Lifeforce}

\duration{Permanent}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{40\% + 4\% / Rank}
\resist{Passive}
\target{Object, entity}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{Object}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
This ritual allows the Adept to bind an object to the life-force of an
entity. The object will reflect the entity's physical condition. If
the entity is well, the object will be in perfect order; if the entity
is sick or wounded, the object will appear appropriately damaged; and
if the entity dies, the object will seem ruined. There is no
limitation on the size or type of object, but it must remain the
entity's possession during the entire ritual. Traditionally, apples,
roses, statues, paintings or diamonds are used. The Life-force Link
may be broken by destroying the object, or by the object being beyond
100 miles (+ 100 / Rank) from the entity. The death of the entity will
not break the Link. If 10,000 (-500 / Rank) is spent on ingredients,
the range is unlimited and the entity and object may occupy different
planes without breaking the Link.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-2]{Petrifaction}

\duration{Permanent}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{55\% + 3\% / Rank}
\resist{Active \& Passive}
\target{Entity}
\casttime{1 hour}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
This ritual allows the Adept to either change one entity to
marble-like stone, or turn one magically petrified entity back to
flesh. The entity must be present for the entirety of the Ritual. Any
possessions of an entity are (un)petrified with the entity. A
petrified entity is not aware of their surroundings, and has time
stopped for the purposes of poison, resurrection, curses and
ageing. Petrifaction is not fatal, although a dead entity may still be
petrified. If an entity is damaged after petrifaction, they may be
repaired with the Mending Spell if the Adept is a Rank 8 Sculptor. Any
damage will be applied when the entity becomes flesh. A petrified
entity weighs 3 times their normal weight.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-3]{Shaping Clay Golems}

\duration{3 hours + 3 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{10\% + 4\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Object}
\basetime{2 hours}
\material{Clay \& Rare Earths}
\materialcost{100 sp}
\actions{Sculpting a statue}
\concentration{None}
\begin{effects}
Turns a quantity of earth into a golem.  Clay golems are susceptible
to fire and immersion; exposure to either will cause D10 FT damage to
the golem every minute. Fire and water based attacks do double damage.
A clay golem will gradually dry out and become immobile if not kept
moist.  In a temperate climate a golem will lose 1 AG per day if no
action is taken to prevent this.  A golem which has completely dried
out cannot be reactivated.  During construction a clay golem may be
designed to resemble a humanoid; this requires that the Adept or an
assistant has the sculptor skill and is familiar with the humanoid
race.  The chance of the golem passing visual inspection is 40\%
(+4/Rank sculptor, +2 / Rank spy).  Note that the golem will not pass
close inspection --- cold, hard skin, lifeless face.  Base

Base Materials: Clay or any soft earth. However clay tends to be the
material of preference as golems made of more crumbly earth fall apart
easily.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-4]{Shaping Rag \& String Golems}

\duration{2 hours + 2 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{40\% + 3\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Object}
\basetime{3 hours}
\material{Cloth, straw \& herbs}
\materialcost{50 sp}
\actions{Building a golem}
\concentration{None}
\begin{effects}
Turns a small mannequin into a golem.  Rag \& string golems are
susceptible to fire; exposure to fire will cause [D - 4] FT damage to
the golem every second pulse. Fire based attacks do double damage.

Base Materials: Cloth, string, rope, straw. Flexible, easily
manipulable materials.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}


\begin{spell}[S-1]{Bubble of Force}

\range{5 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{20 minutes + 20 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The spell causes an iridescent bubble of force to appear. The
substance of the bubble prevents the occupant(s) from interacting with
the world outside the bubble other than by sight and sound. The bubble
is transparent to low levels of light and sound, but it prevents
damaging levels of either passing through it. The bubble is impervious
from both sides. It also absorbs physical damage, including that
caused by falling. The bubble is impenetrable to magic - it may not be
targeted through, and area effects will not pass through the
bubble. Inside, it provides a stable, warm and dry environment, with
fresh air to breathe. The surface of the bubble is hard to the
touch. The bubble may be rolled on a solid surface by an entity within
it, by entities outside, or by a very strong wind or similar physical
force. It will float on water or mud, lava and similar semi-solid
substances, and may be carried by wind or current. At Ranks 0-10, the
bubble is 5' in diameter (one hex), at Ranks 11-15, it is 10' across
(three hexes), and at Ranks 16-20, it is 15' (seven hexes). All the
bubble must appear within range. The bubble may enclose any entities
and objects completely within the target hexes, if they fail to
resist. Successful resistance will cause the entity to be gently
pushed aside by the bubble. If the spell is cast in a gas, the gas is
displaced outside the bubble. If cast in a liquid, the liquid is
displaced, and the bubble will bob to the surface. The spell may not
be cast inside a solid substance, or where there is insufficient room
for the bubble to form without having to displace an immovable
solid. Thus the whole sphere will always appear above ground. The
bubble may be dissipated by anyone casting a Binder Special Knowledge
Counterspell of at least equal Rank.

Up to 20 (+ 10 / Rank) square feet, or 1 (+ 1 / 2 Ranks) hexes, of
contiguous surface becomes nearly frictionless, somewhat like wet
ice. Footing becomes treacherous, and handholds non-existent. Any
entity attempting to move on a frictionless surface must make a 1 \x
AG check each pulse, or fall prone. If they do fall, a successful AG
check is required to regain their feet; and while prone, they will
continue in the direction of their last movement until they clear the
frictionless surface. The effect is not normally visible.

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Instant Golem}

\range{10 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Object(s)}
\begin{effects}
This spell is cast to produce a specific type of golem with which the
adept is familiar (must be greater than Rank 0 in the appropriate
ritual) from materials within their range.

If a sufficient quantity of materials is not within the Adept's range
the spell will automatically fail.

When cast the materials within range will animate and draw together at
the point where the majority of the materials are coming from.  A
golem will form in 20 seconds (-1 / Rank).  In the pulse after it has
finished forming the golem will be ready to carry out its master's
commands.

The effective rank of the golem is the rank which the adept has in the
appropriate ritual.

The duration of the golem is the duration of this spell.  At the end
of the duration the golem will collapse and its component materials
will re-animate and attempt to return to their previous location and
state.

Note for Investment: When Invested, the effective rank of the golem is
the rank that the investing adept had in the appropriate ritual at the
time of investment.  The type of golem is set at the time of
investment.  The created golem will consider the triggerer to be its
master.

Note for Ward: The type and effective rank of the golem are set at the
time of warding.  The Adept may also instill a basic instinct into the
golem at the time of warding (\eg kill, serve, assist, guard, dig,
eat, etc.); the actions of the golem will be governed by this
instinct.  The instinct is always simple and indiscriminate (\eg kill:
the golem will attempt to kill anyone or anything that it perceives).
The golem's master is the warding adept.

\duration{Special}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{1\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell immediately starts to petrify the target. For the next 5
seconds, all the target's percentage chances and D10 rolls are
halved. At the end of this time, they must make their resistance
check. If they succeed, they may resume normal activities, otherwise
the petrifaction runs its course, leaving the target as marble-like
stone.

As with Ritual Petrifaction, any possessions of the target are
petrified with the target. A petrified entity is not aware of their
surroundings, and has time stopped for the purposes of poison,
resurrection, curses and ageing. Petrifaction is not fatal, although a
dead entity may still be petrified.

\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
This spell enables the Adept to instil a possession of up to 5 lbs (+5
/ Rank) with the power of flight. The spell will dissipate if the
object stops being a possession of the Adept, the Adept loses
concentration, or if the object is broken. The Adept may cause the
object to fly at 20 miles per hour (+ 2 / Rank). It will take off and
accelerate up to full speed, or halt and land, in a single pulse. The
object may support 150 lbs (+ 50 / Rank) in addition to its own
weight. Naturally flexible or fragile items gain sufficient strength
and rigidity to support the load. Any object or entity that falls from
the flying object will move off in a random direction. If the object
is about to crash into a surface, it will attempt to land, although
some surfaces may be inappropriate for this (lava, sheer walls, etc.).

\begin{effects}
One object is transformed into a representative figurine of itself.
This spell will fail if the target is not free-standing or if the
target does not fit within a 5 foot (+ 1 / Rank) cube.  The figurine
will look like the original item but have the structural strength of
soft wood and will have no moving parts.  The figurine will be 1/12th
of the size (min 1 inch in its longest dimension) and 1/10th the
weight of the original.  Any items contained within the target will
not be affected, and may destroy the item as it shrinks.  The figurine
will revert to normal when the spell expires or the figurine is
broken.

\begin{effects}
This spell enables the Adept to use their hands as if they were common
tools. The hands do not change appearance. The Adept may freely change
from the mimicry of one tool to another without re-casting the
spell. This spell does not affect the damage done by Unarmed
Combat. This spell does not enhance the Adept's craftsmanship, nor
protect them while they work (except for the protective properties of
the tools they are emulating).  The tools that may be mimicked must be
reasonably simple, and include: adze, auger, chisel, crowbar, hammer,
hatchet, level, pickaxe, plane, pliers, plumb-bob, rock drill, saw,
shovel, sickle, spokeshave, square, tongs and mallet.

The Adept may transmute a volume of 2 cubic feet (+ 2 / Rank) of
non-living matter into any other matter. The matter must retain its
elemental state --- solid to solid, liquid to liquid, gas to gas. The
transmuted matter will retain its original size and shape, but assumes
all other physical characteristics of the resulting matter. The Adept
must have some familiarity with the resulting matter.

\resist{Passive}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self and Controlled Golem}
\begin{effects}
The Adept's body goes into a coma and the Adept's mind goes into the
body of the target golem.  The Willpower, Magical Aptitude, Perception
and Magic Resistance of the golem are replaced by those of the Adept.
The Adept may only use ranks in abilities which they have, and the
golem has been attuned to.

During the possession the Adept uses the golem's senses.  The Adept
may also speak through the golem's mouth.

The Adept may cast while possessing any non-iron golem, however: The
FT cost of the magic is applied to the Adept's body and the host
golem; The Adept cannot cast if the host golem has no FT; Backfires
affect the Adept's body and the host golem (if applicable).

If the host golem takes Endurance damage then the adept's body takes
half of that amount as FT damage.  If the host golem is knocked
unconscious or killed then the adept must make a Willpower check or
fall unconscious for D10 minutes; the multiple is \x 2 for
unconsciousness or \x 1 for death.

This spell unfastens, opens or unties all closures, buckles, straps,
ties, knots, locks and other fastenings on the target (causing most
armour, clothes, and packs to fall off).  This will not undo stitching
or weaving, and it will not cause any damage to the target.  If
targeted on an entity then all of their possessions will be affected
by the spell.

\begin{effects}
This spell summons and binds together particles of dust and sand to
create a wall with the strength and solidity of sandstone. The wall
may be 15' tall 20' long 1' thick; or a ring 10' high with a 10'
diameter; or a pillar 15' high with a 4' diameter. The Adept may
increase any dimension by 1' / Rank. The Adept determines the position
and orientation of the Wall, but at least one edge must be affixed to
a solid surface. The fixed edge of the wall will bind fast to the
adjacent surface, and can support the rest of the wall. Any entity
that is in the area of the wall when it is cast will be ejected to the
closest point outside the wall - if this is impossible, the wall will
not appear. The wall may be destroyed by inflicting 100 points of
damage, or a 5' \x 5' \x 5' hole may be caused by inflicting 50 points
of damage.

\begin{effects}
This spell allows the Adept to pass through solid matter by becoming
insubstantial. However, they may not pass through cold iron. The Adept
has a TMR of 1 while within solid matter, and may move in any
direction, including up and down. The Adept gains no ability to see
through solid matter, but may breathe in it. While under the effects
of this spell, the Adept is virtually immune to physical damage except
that inflicted by cold iron, but conversely cannot harm anyone in
melee unless they use cold iron in return. If the Adept is caught in a
solid object when the spell expires, they lose the ability to breathe
in solid matter, and are trapped.

This ritual enhances the duration of one of the Adept's spells or
rituals belonging to the College of Binding and Animating Magics.  The
magic must have been cast previously, and have sufficient duration to
last through the performance of this ritual. This ritual may not be
used with any magics with concentration-based or indefinite,
condition-based duration. A spell that has been enhanced by this
ritual may not be counter-spelled, but may still be dissipated.
Material costs for this ritual are 10,000 sp (- 400 / Rank) for
General Knowledge Spells, 20,000 sp (- 800 / Rank) for Special
Knowledge Spells, and 30,000 sp (- 1200 / Rank) for Rituals.

\begin{ritual}[R-2]{Investment}

\begin{effects}
Except as noted below, this ritual is identical to the ritual of the
same name in the College Magic - Investment section
(\S\ref{investment}). Adepts of this College learn this Ritual of
Investment instead of the standard version. The Adept may invest
either a spell of their own or that of a willing Mage who participates
in the full ritual. If the spell being invested is contributed by
another Mage, the maximum number of charges stored is half the Rank in
the ritual. The maximum investable rank of the spell is Spell Rank - [
(20 -Ritual Rank) / 2 ]. A spell whose maximum investable rank is
reduced below Rank 0 may not be invested. The Adept may not have any
assistance in creating scrolls.

The Adept may create an object from a larger source of its constituent
substances by drawing forth the materials from the source.  All
constituent materials must be within 5 feet (+ 5 / Rank).  Any number
of different substances may be combined into a single finished object
with this ritual. The substance sources are in no way damaged or
reduced by the ritual. The created object may be any object which the
adept can see or has studied and may not exceed 10 cubic feet (+ 10
per Rank) in volume, nor 50 lbs (+ 50 / Rank) in weight. The object is
physically real with all normal attributes. The object may not be
created enclosed by or enclosing anything. Complicated or fine quality
objects may not be created without the appropriate artisan skill. No
alchemical, herbal or other quasi-magical objects may be
created. Created food provides no sustenance.  At the end of its
duration the item vanishes.  The object is a magical construct and
will have a magical aura, regardless of its constituent materials.

Turns a quantity of wood into a golem.  Wood golems are susceptible to
fire; exposure to fire will cause D10 FT Damage to the Golem every 30
seconds.  Fire based attacks do double damage.  During construction a
wood golem may be designed to resemble a tree, this requires that the
Adept or an assistant has the Herbalist skill.  The chance of the
golem passing casual inspection is 40\% (+ 5 / Rank Herbalist).  Note
that the disguise will only work if the golem is not moving.

Base Materials: All wood types, including wicker, cane and bamboo, but
excluding fossilised woods and grasses.  GMs may rule that unusual

touch, and a message is stored instead of a spell. The message is
replayed exactly as the Adept recorded it, and may contain any
verbalisations that the Adept is capable of. The message may not
exceed 5 words (+ 3 words / Rank). Unlike the Ward ritual, the message
may be triggered one additional time per two full Ranks.

used to fix objects with an effective Artisan Rank greater than that
the Adept possesses will degrade the object's effective rank. Magical
items made mundane through breaking will remain mundane even after the
use of a Mending. The Spell of Mending may be used on a living
creature that has been transformed into stone, and subsequently
broken. This requires that the Binder be a Sculptor of at least Rank
8. A Spell of Mending may be used to repair Golems. It may repair
either a Specific Grievous injury, or all general Endurance damage.

\begin{effects} Turns a quantity of earth into a golem.  Clay golems
are susceptible to fire and immersion; exposure to either will cause
D10 FT damage to the golem every minute. Fire and water based attacks
do double damage.  A clay golem will gradually dry out and become
immobile if not kept moist.  In a temperate climate a golem will lose
1 AG per day if no action is taken to prevent this.  A golem which has
completely dried out cannot be reactivated.  During construction a
clay golem may be designed to resemble a humanoid; this requires that
the Adept or an assistant has the sculptor skill and is familiar with
the humanoid race.  The chance of the golem passing visual inspection
is 40\% (+4/Rank sculptor, +2 / Rank spy).  Note that the golem will
not pass close inspection --- cold, hard skin, lifeless face.  Base

\begin{effects} The spell causes an iridescent bubble of force to
appear. The substance of the bubble prevents the occupant(s) from
interacting with the world outside the bubble other than by sight and
sound. The bubble is transparent to low levels of light and sound, but
it prevents damaging levels of either passing through it. The bubble
is impervious from both sides. It also absorbs physical damage,
including that caused by falling. The bubble is impenetrable to magic
- it may not be targeted through, and area effects will not pass
through the bubble. Inside, it provides a stable, warm and dry
environment, with fresh air to breathe. The surface of the bubble is
hard to the touch. The bubble may be rolled on a solid surface by an
entity within it, by entities outside, or by a very strong wind or
similar physical force. It will float on water or mud, lava and
similar semi-solid substances, and may be carried by wind or
current. At Ranks 0-10, the bubble is 5' in diameter (one hex), at
Ranks 11-15, it is 10' across (three hexes), and at Ranks 16-20, it is
15' (seven hexes). All the bubble must appear within range. The bubble
may enclose any entities and objects completely within the target
hexes, if they fail to resist. Successful resistance will cause the
entity to be gently pushed aside by the bubble. If the spell is cast
in a gas, the gas is displaced outside the bubble. If cast in a
liquid, the liquid is displaced, and the bubble will bob to the
surface. The spell may not be cast inside a solid substance, or where
there is insufficient room for the bubble to form without having to
displace an immovable solid. Thus the whole sphere will always appear
above ground. The bubble may be dissipated by anyone casting a Binder
Special Knowledge Counterspell of at least equal Rank.

\begin{effects} This ritual enhances the duration of one of the Adept's
spells or rituals belonging to the College of Binding and Animating
Magics.  The magic must have been cast previously, and have sufficient
duration to last through the performance of this ritual. This ritual
may not be used with any magics with concentration-based or
indefinite, condition-based duration. A spell that has been enhanced
by this ritual may not be counter-spelled, but may still be
dissipated.  Material costs for this ritual are 10,000 sp (- 400 /
Rank) for General Knowledge Spells, 20,000 sp (- 800 / Rank) for
Special Knowledge Spells, and 30,000 sp (- 1200 / Rank) for Rituals.

Name, the name will not be revealed, but its existence will be.  This
ritual cannot backfire.

\begin{effects} The Adept may create an object from a larger source of
its constituent substances by drawing forth the materials from the
source.  All constituent materials must be within 5 feet (+ 5 / Rank).
Any number of different substances may be combined into a single
finished object with this ritual. The substance sources are in no way
damaged or reduced by the ritual. The created object may be any object
which the adept can see or has studied and may not exceed 10 cubic
feet (+ 10 per Rank) in volume, nor 50 lbs (+ 50 / Rank) in
weight. The object is physically real with all normal attributes. The
object may not be created enclosed by or enclosing
anything. Complicated or fine quality objects may not be created
without the appropriate artisan skill. No alchemical, herbal or other
quasi-magical objects may be created. Created food provides no
sustenance.  At the end of its duration the item vanishes.  The object
is a magical construct and will have a magical aura, regardless of its
constituent materials.

Golem every 30 seconds.  Fire based attacks do double damage.  During
construction a wood golem may be designed to resemble a tree, this
requires that the Adept or an assistant has the Herbalist skill.  The
chance of the golem passing casual inspection is 40\% (+ 5 / Rank
Herbalist).  Note that the disguise will only work if the golem is not
moving.

\item[Weapon Ranks] A Golem wields weapons like a humanoid.  If the
golem has been attuned to a weapon then it may use that weapon at Rank
0.  If that weapon is also built-in to the golem (or Unarmed) then it
will wield the weapon at Rank (Lower of: (Rank in Ritual / 2) or Max
Rank).  All other weapons will be wielded as if Unranked.  Note that a
golem will not Evade or attempt any special manoeuvre (eg Trip,
Disarm) unless possessed by an adept.

this in no way affects the status of the old layer. If an old,

are susceptible to fire \& immersion, exposure to either will cause
[D10] FT Damage to the Golem every minute. Fire and water based
attacks do double damage.  A Clay golem will gradually dry out and
become immobile if not kept moist.  In a temperate climate a golem
will lose 1 AG per day if no action is taken to prevent this.  A
golem which has completely dried out cannot be reactivated.  During
construction a Clay Golem may be designed to resemble a humanoid, this
requires that the adept or an assistant has the Sculptor skill and is
familiar with the Humanoid race.  The chance of the Golem passing
visual inspection is 40\% (+4/Rank Sculptor, +2/Rank Spy).  Note that
the golem will not pass close inspection - Cold, hard skin, lifeless
face.  Base Materials: Clay or any soft earth. However clay tends to
be the material of preference as Golems made of more crumbly earth
fall apart easily.

golem at the time of warding (\eg Kill, Serve, Assist, Guard, Dig,
Eat, etc.) the actions of the golem will be governed by this instinct.
The instinct is always simple and indiscriminate (\eg Kill: the golem
will attempt to kill anyone or anything that it perceives).  The
golem's master is the warding adept.

\emph{Effects:} This spell allows the Adept to record a verbal message in an object, and defines the conditions under which the message will be replayed. This spell operates in most respects similarly to the Ward ritual, except that the range is the range of this spell or touch, and a message is stored instead of a spell. The message is replayed exactly as the Adept recorded it, and may contain any verbalisation's that the Adept is capable of. The message may not exceed 5 words (+ 3 words /Rank). Unlike the Ward ritual, the message may be triggered one additional time per two full Ranks).

Rank), or one Golem, can be mended. A mended object becomes exactly as it was before it was broken or deformed. Any pieces missing when the spell is cast will remain missing when the object is mended. Mending used to fix objects with an effective Artisan Rank greater than that the Adept possesses will degrade the object's effective rank. Magical items made mundane through breaking will remain mundane even after the use of a Mending. The Spell of Mending may be used on a living creature that has been transformed into stone, and subsequently broken. This requires that the Binder be a Sculptor of at least Rank 8. A Spell of Mending may be used to repair Golems. It may repair either a Specific Grievous injury, or all general Endurance damage.
d355 5
a359 1
\emph{Effects:} This spell allows the Adept to able to modify the aura strength of any one object or entity. The target object may be up to 20 cubic feet (+ 20 / Rank).The strength of the aura increases or decreases by up to 1 + (1 / 4 Ranks) on the table below. This spell does not alter the target's aura in any other way.
d388 16
a403 1
\emph{Effects:} The Adept may create a simple, common object from a larger source of its constituent substances by reaching into the source and withdrawing the object. For example, the Adept may reach into a tree and produce a staff. One (+ 1 / 5 full Ranks) different substances may be combined into a single finished object with this spell. The substance sources are in no way damaged or reduced by the spell. The created object will be a common example of its type and may not exceed 1 cubic foot (+ 1 per Rank) in volume, nor 1 lb (+ 1 lb / Rank) in weight. The object is physically real with all normal attributes. The object may not be created enclosed by or enclosing anything. Complicated or fine quality objects may not be created without the appropriate artisan skill. No alchemical, herbal or other quasi-magical objects may be created. Created food provides no sustenance.  At the end of its duration the item vanishes.  The object is a magical construct and will have a magical aura, regardless of its constituent materials.
d416 17
a432 1
\emph{Effects:} A volume of up to 2 cubic feet (+ 2 / Rank) containing one of the four material Elements (air, water, earth, fire) can be moulded by the Adept into any form desired, and will retain that form for the duration of the spell. The Adept must immediately mould the element into the correct shape with their hands. During this time the Adept is protected from the effects of the element, which is as malleable as putty. The time taken to mould the element is dependent on the size and complexity of the object desired, but will be at least a pulse. After the initial moulding, the element will retain its shape, unless something disrupts it, when it will immediately attempt to reform, possibly around or on top of the impedance. The shaped element will have a defined boundary and shape, but will not be rigid (excluding shaped earth). The spell cannot be cast over any entity. The Adept may use applicable artisan skills to shape an object of greater than Rank 0 quality. Once the spell expires the element will act normally according to its substance, shape, and natural laws.
d445 8
a452 1
\emph{Effects:} This spell preserves and protects one animate, dead or undead entity, of up to 100 pounds (+ 100 / Rank) or a collection of small objects of a total weight not greater than 1 pound (+ 1 / Rank) against the effects of time, decay, rust, erosion or wave action. It does not confer any protection against magical attacks. It will not suspend time with regard to resurrection, poisons, curses, etc. Duration is 4 (+ Rank squared) days, but is permanent at Rank 20.
d465 6
a470 1
\emph{Effects:} This spell causes a volume of non-living solid material to become as transparent as high quality glass, but to otherwise retain its original characteristics. One (+ 1 / Rank) adjacent 1 foot cubes may be affected. The Adept may cause the volume to be transparent from only a single direction, by reducing the BC by 10.
d486 14
a499 1
\emph{Effects:} This ritual allows the Adept to bind an object to the life-force of an entity. The object will reflect the entity's physical condition. If the entity is well, the object will be in perfect order; if the entity is sick or wounded, the object will appear appropriately damaged; and if the entity dies, the object will seem ruined. There is no limitation on the size or type of object, but it must remain the entity's possession during the entire ritual. Traditionally, apples, roses, statues, paintings or diamonds are used. The Life-force Link may be broken by destroying the object, or by the object being beyond 100 miles (+ 100 / Rank) from the entity. The death of the entity will not break the Link. If 10,000 (-500 / Rank) is spent on ingredients, the range is unlimited and the entity and object may occupy different planes without breaking the Link.
d512 12
a523 1
\emph{Effects:} This ritual allows the Adept to either change one entity to marble-like stone, or turn one magically petrified entity back to flesh. The entity must be present for the entirety of the Ritual. Any possessions of an entity are (un)petrified with the entity. A petrified entity is not aware of their surroundings, and has time stopped for the purposes of poison, resurrection, curses and ageing. Petrifaction is not fatal, although a dead entity may still be petrified. If an entity is damaged after petrifaction, they may be repaired with the Mending Spell if the Adept is a Rank 8 Sculptor. Any damage will be applied when the entity becomes flesh. A petrified entity weighs 3 times their normal weight.

will loose 1 AG per day if no action is taken to prevent this.  A

a574 2
\emph{Effects:} Turns a small mannequin into a golem.  Rag \& String Golems are susceptible to fire, exposure to fire will cause [D10-4] FT Damage to the Golem every second pulse. Fire based attacks do double damage.
Base Materials: Cloth, String, Rope, Straw. Flexible, easily manipulable materials.
d628 4
a631 1
\emph{Effects:} The Adept may disintegrate up to 2 cubic feet (+ 2 / Rank) of a non-magical object. If the object has any magical attributes, the spell will fail.
d644 9
a652 1
\emph{Effects:} Up to 20 (+ 10 / Rank) square feet, or 1 (+ 1 / 2 Ranks) hexes, of contiguous surface becomes nearly frictionless, somewhat like wet ice. Footing becomes treacherous, and handholds non-existent. Any entity attempting to move on a frictionless surface must make a 1 AG check each pulse, or fall prone. If they do fall, a successful AG check is required to regain their feet; and while prone, they will continue in the direction of their last movement until they clear the frictionless surface. The effect is not normally visible.
d665 35
a699 13
\emph{Effects:} This spell is cast to produce a specific type of golem with which the adept is familiar (must be greater than rank 0 in the appropriate ritual) from materials within their range.

If a sufficient quantity of materials is not within the adept's range the spell will automatically fail.

When cast the materials within range will animate and draw together at the point where the majority of the materials are coming from.  A golem will form in 20 seconds (-1/Rank).  In the pulse after it has finished forming the golem will be ready to carry out it's master's commands.

The effective rank of the golem is the rank which the adept has in the appropriate ritual.

The duration of the golem is the duration of this spell.  At the end of the duration the golem will collapse and its component materials will re-animate and attempt to return to their previous location and state.

Note for Investment: When Invested, the effective rank of the golem is the rank that the investing adept had in the appropriate ritual at the time of investment.  The type of golem is set at the time of investment.  The created golem will consider the triggerer to be its master.

Note for Ward: The type and effective rank of the golem are set at the time of warding.  The adept may also instill a basic instinct into the golem at the time of warding (eg. Kill, Serve, Assist, Guard, Dig, Eat, etc.) the actions of the golem will be governed by this instinct.  The instinct is always simple and indiscriminate (eg. Kill: the golem will attempt to kill anyone or anything that it perceives).  The golem's master is the warding adept.
d712 13
a724 2
\emph{Effects:} This spell immediately starts to petrify the target. For the next 5 seconds, all the target's percentage chances and D10 rolls are halved. At the end of this time, they must make their resistance check. If they succeed, they may resume normal activities, otherwise the petrifaction runs its course, leaving the target as marble-like stone.
As with Ritual Petrifaction, any possessions of the target are petrified with the target. A petrified entity is not aware of their surroundings, and has time stopped for the purposes of poison, resurrection, curses and ageing. Petrifaction is not fatal, although a dead entity may still be petrified.
d737 13
a749 1
\emph{Effects:} This spell enables the Adept to instil a possession of up to 5 lbs (+5 / Rank) with the power of flight. The spell will dissipate if the object stops being a possession of the Adept, the Adept loses concentration, or if the object is broken. The Adept may cause the object to fly at 20 miles per hour (+ 2 / Rank). It will take off and accelerate up to full speed, or halt and land, in a single pulse. The object may support 150 lbs (+ 50 / Rank) in addition to its own weight. Naturally flexible or fragile items gain sufficient strength and rigidity to support the load. Any object or entity that falls from the flying object will move off in a random direction. If the object is about to crash into a surface, it will attempt to land, although some surfaces may be inappropriate for this (lava, sheer walls, etc.).
d762 11
a772 1
\emph{Effects:} One object is transformed into a representative figurine of itself.  This spell will fail if the target is not free-standing or if the target does not fit within a 5 foot (+ 1 / Rank) cube.  The figurine will look like the original item but have the structural strength of soft wood and will have no moving parts.  The figurine will be 1/12th of the size (min 1 inch in its longest dimension) and 1/10th the weight of the original.  Any items contained within the target will not be affected, and may destroy the item as it shrinks.  The figurine will revert to normal when the spell expires or the figurine is broken.
d785 11
a795 1
\emph{Effects:} This spell enables the Adept to use their hands as if they were common tools. The hands do not change appearance. The Adept may freely change from the mimicry of one tool to another without re-casting the spell. This spell does not affect the damage done by Unarmed Combat. This spell does not enhance the Adept's craftsmanship, nor protect them while they work (except for the protective properties of the tools they are emulating).  The tools that may be mimicked must be reasonably simple, and include: adze, auger, chisel, crowbar, hammer, hatchet, level, pickaxe, plane, pliers, plumb-bob, rock drill, saw, shovel, sickle, spokeshave, square, tongs and mallet.
d808 7
a814 1
\emph{Effects:} The Adept may transmute a volume of 2 cubic feet (+ 2 / Rank) of non-living matter into any other matter. The matter must retain its elemental state - solid to solid, liquid to liquid, gas to gas. The transmuted matter will retain its original size and shape, but assumes all other physical characteristics of the resulting matter. The Adept must have some familiarity with the resulting matter.
d827 20
a846 4
\emph{Effects:} The adept's body goes into a coma, the adept's mind goes into the body of the target golem.  The Willpower, Magical Aptitude, Perception and Magic Resistance of the golem are replaced by those of the adept.  The adept may only use ranks in abilities which they have, and the golem has been attuned to.
During the possession the adept uses the golem's senses.  The adept may also speak through the golem's mouth.
The adept may cast while possessing any non-iron golem, however: The FT cost of the magic is applied to the adept's body and the host golem;  The adept cannot cast if the host golem has no FT;  Backfires affect the adept's body and the host golem (if applicable).
If the host Golem takes Endurance damage then the adept's body takes half of that amount as FT damage.  If the host golem is knocked unconscious or killed then the adept must make a Willpower check or fall unconscious for D10 minutes, the multiple is x2 for Unconsciousness or x1 for Death.
d859 7
a865 1
\emph{Effects:} This spell unfastens, opens or unties all closures, buckles, straps, ties, knots, locks and other fastenings on the target (causing most armour, clothes, and packs to fall off).  This will not undo stitching or weaving, and it will not cause any damage to the target.  If targeted on an entity then all of their possessions will be affected by the spell.
d878 14
a891 1
\emph{Effects:} This spell summons and binds together particles of dust and sand to create a wall with the strength and solidity of sandstone. The wall may be 15' tall   20' long   1' thick; or a ring 10' high with a 10' diameter; or a pillar 15' high with a  4' diameter. The Adept may increase any dimension by 1' / Rank. The Adept determines the position and orientation of the Wall, but at least one edge must be affixed to a solid surface. The fixed edge of the wall will bind fast to the adjacent surface, and can support the rest of the wall. Any entity that is in the area of the wall when it is cast will be ejected to the closest point outside the wall - if this is impossible, the wall will not appear. The wall may be destroyed by inflicting 100 points of damage, or a 5' 5' 5' hole may be caused by inflicting 50 points of damage.
d904 11
a914 1
\emph{Effects:} This spell allows the Adept to pass through solid matter by becoming insubstantial. However, they may not pass through cold iron. The Adept has a TMR of 1 while within solid matter, and may move in any direction, including up and down. The Adept gains no ability to see through solid matter, but may breathe in it. While under the effects of this spell, the Adept is virtually immune to physical damage, except that inflicted by cold iron, but conversely, cannot harm anyone in melee unless they use cold iron in return. If the Adept is caught in a solid object when the spell expires, they lose the ability to breathe in solid matter, and are trapped.
d1036 4
a1039 1
\emph{Effects:} Turns a quantity of stone into a golem.  Stone golems are the heaviest of all golems.  Stone golems cannot be stealthy, they grind as they move.  A Stone Golem can usually be heard coming from 100 Yards away.

(\S\ref{colleged:investment}). Adepts of this College learn this
Ritual of Investment instead of the standard version. The Adept may
invest either a spell of their own or that of a willing Mage who
participates in the full ritual. If the spell being invested is
contributed by another Mage, the maximum number of charges stored is
half the Rank in the ritual. The maximum investable rank of the spell
is Spell Rank - [ (20 -Ritual Rank) / 2 ]. A spell whose maximum
investable rank is reduced below rank 0 may not be invested. The Adept
may not have any assistance in creating scrolls.

commonly known as Binders.  Binders tend to be less concerned with the
d9 21
a29 36
around until something works.  The College holds that the universe is
an unimaginably large machine, put in place by the great Powers eons
ago, and then left to tick like a huge pendulum clock, slow but
inexorable, and that everything in the Universe, lowest to highest, is
just another cogwheel in the great design.  Binders are often accused
of lacking empathy, the blame being laid on the amount of time they
spend associating with inanimate objects.  But many Binders have been
known to cultivate a rather impish sense of humour, possibly because
of these same circumstances.  Certainly the College itself presents no
end of opportunity to the imaginative trickster.  The closest College
to Binding is that of the elusive Shapers, with whom they share some
cosmetic similarities.  The College has been cloistered until only
relatively recently and it is not well known.  Much of the Binder's
knowledge was lost in the fall of the last age, aggravated no doubt by
the fact that Binders are found almost exclusively in cities, where
there are more clients for their trade in minor magical items. It is
said that before the Fall, the Binders possessed the secret of
bestowing true life on their creations, rather than the temporary
animations that they now employ. Relations with all of the other
Colleges are cordial, tinged with a little suspicion perhaps from the
Elementalists who view the manipulation of their particular element as
their exclusive domain.  The College is much associated with certain
artisan trades, such as Carpentry, Sculpting, Smithing and the like,
and the College's structure tends to follow a Master-Apprentice form.
Many Binders possess one or more craft-type trades, some may be found
practising the Mechanician skill, whilst others tend towards
Philosopher, usually specialising in engineering, architecture, and
the like, as all of these abilities complement the College's
mechanistic style of magic.

\textbf{Traditional Colours:}
There are no colours, as such, associated with the College, but
rather the style of the clothes themselves.  Seldom will you see a
Binder garbed in anything other than sensible work-type clothes,
usually with a leather apron anchored in place, and bedecked with
various odd tools.

turning others, in an endless chain, though this is sometimes
simplified to but a single wheel, with the others merely implied.
Recently, the symbolism of clockwork mechanisms have gained some
popularity with the College, who see them as scale models of the
Universe.  The image most associated with the College in the minds of
the general citizenry is neither of these.  Rather it is that of
their comical and marionette-like Rag \& String Golems that many

The arts of the College of Binding and Animating Magics can require
special knowledge; special equipment; and the expenditure of time and
money.  The exact nature of the material components, and the various
artisans required, are discussed under the individual rituals. Binders
may hire specialist artisans to help them with some rituals.  The cost
of hiring artisans is not accounted for in the costs of the materials
needed to perform each ritual.  The materials required for some of the
rituals of this College may be quite expensive or rare.  Nevertheless,
any materials needed for a ritual must be available or the ritual
cannot be begun.


\subsubsection{Material Loss}

Unless otherwise specified under the individual ritual, materials are
not lost if the ritual fails, but are ruined if a Backfire result is
achieved, even if there are no other specified backfire results.

\subsection{Golems}

\subsubsection{General}

The activation, deactivation, and binding of Golems is somewhat
complex.  Once a Golem has been created, by use of one of the various
rituals of shaping Golems, it may be activated by the use of Animation
(G-2).  A Golem will have a magical aura, or magical component to its
aura, from the time that the Creation Ritual is completed.

\subsubsection{Control Check}

The first time that a particular Golem is activated, a Control Check
must be made.  The Base Chance of this check is equal to (2 x Binder's
Willpower + Binder's Rank with G-2).  This roll determines whether the
Golem will be a "Controlled" or ``Uncontrolled'' Golem.  On each and
every subsequent activation, the Golem will be ``Controlled'' or
``Uncontrolled'' depending on this initial roll. Once this control
state is set, it may only be changed through the use of Binding Golems
(S-2).  The use of this spell changes the Golem's state to
``Controlled''.  Use of Deactivating Golems (S-4) merely turns Golems
off and in no way changes their control state.  If a ``Controlled''
Golem is given continuing instructions (such as ``guard this door
against intruders'') and is then deactivated, or the duration of the
animation expires, it will continue to carry out these orders when
next activated.  If a Golem with this type of order is animated by
someone other than the person who gave the orders, it will still
attempt to carry out its last order, but may be stopped by its new
controller.

{\small Ex.  A Binder may set up a Golem to guard a door (with the
appropriate instructions) and then deactivate it.  They could then
place a ward around the Golem containing Animation (G2) to be
triggered by intruders.  When the ward was triggered the Golem would
reactivate and begin carrying out its anti-intruder orders.}

\subsubsection{Uncontrolled Golems}

The actions of uncontrolled Golems must be determined by the GM.
Unintelligent Golems are almost certain to attack any and all entities
that they can catch, whilst the intelligent ones might attack, or
flee, or do whatever the GM feels is appropriate.

\subsubsection{Clay, Stone and Iron Golems}

These are mindless ``animates'', but are treated as entities for the
purposes of determining what spells may affect them, etc.  None of
these Golems can recover lost Endurance, unless the physical damage to
their form is repaired in some way (e.g., Mending G-5).  They may not regain
lost Fatigue while activated, but are always activated with a full
quota of Fatigue.  Their Aura is in all ways equivalent to that of
``Non-Sentient Undead''.  Note that Non-sentient Golems that are made
permanent by the use of Binding Permanency (R-3) may recover Fatigue
whilst active at the rate of 1 point of FT per 24 hours.


\subsubsection{Rag \& String and Flesh Golems}

These are sentient entities and are treated as such.  Both of these
Golem types may regain lost Fatigue and Endurance normally, except
that Rag \& String Golems cannot recover Fatigue by eating.  Their
Aura is in all ways equivalent to ``Sentient Undead''.

\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}

These modifiers are cumulative with all other modifiers (including
those specified in \S\ref{magic:modifiers}).

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lXr}
\textbf{Ritual} & Per 10\% extra spent on materials (if any) & +1 \\

\emph{Base Chance:} 2 \x MA + 3\% / Rank \\
d178 22
a199 18
\emph{Effects:}
Adepts of this College have the ability to determine whether an item,
person, or area within 50 feet (+ 10 / Rank) is currently under an
enchantment or magical effect.  The Adept must be able to see the
object, entity or area.  This magic can be an operating spell, a ward,
an invested spell, or any other magical force.  It does not tell what
type of enchantment exists, only whether or not an enchantment is
present.  A double effect will allow the Adept to know the general
type of the magic (e.g., protective, summoning), and a triple effect
will tell the Adept the exact type of the magic (e.g., Wall of Bones,
Hellfire, Ward) but not the College or Rank.  The Talent operates
with a Base Chance of 2 \x Magical Aptitude (+ 3 / Rank), but the Base
Chance rises to 3 \x Magical Aptitude (+ 3 / Rank) if the Adept
physically examines (touches) a particular item, person or place for
Enchantment.  This talent may not be re-used on any particular item,
person or place until 60 (- 2 / Rank) minutes have elapsed, and may
only be re-attempted if the Adept has not performed this talent
successfully on the target within the last three months.

\emph{Effects:}
An area of a non-living solid, 1 square foot (+ 1 per 2 or fraction
Ranks) in size, is magically enchanted to adhere to any objects coming
into contact with it.  The area so affected may be of any shape
provided that no dimension is less than 1 foot.  Once stuck, an object
is released when the spell's duration expires, or a successful
Physical Strength check is made to tear the object free.  The
Multiplier for the PS check is dependent on the rank of the Adhesion
spell, as follows:

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Multiplier} \\
0--5	& 3.0 \\
6--10	& 2.0 \\
11--15	& 1.5 \\

\end{tabular}

if brought into contact with the affected area again.  Nor is the
spell in any way broken by having an object torn away; the area the
object was stuck to remains as adhesive as before.  Except for the
crowding of the area, there is no limit to the number of objects that
may be stuck with one casting of the spell.  It should be noted that
the durability of some objects may be less than the force required to
tear them free from the spell's grip.

d241 16
a256 39
\emph{Effects:}
This spell has two distinct uses; it may activate Golems and it may
animate objects.

\textbf{Activating Golems:}
This spell will activate Golems that have been prepared via Q2, Q3,
R6, R7, or R8, but are not presently activated.  The duration of their
activation depends on the type of Golem (see the individual Golem
shaping rituals).

\textbf{Animating Objects:}
This spell may be used to animate any one object, of up to 10 pounds
(+ 10 / Rank) in weight.  This ``animate'' will possess rudimentary
intelligence and senses, sufficient for it to follow the caster's
orders.  The orders under which the ``animate'' is acting at any one
time, cannot be longer than 2 (+ l for every 3 or fraction of 3 Ranks)
words in length.  ``Animates'' will move about in a manner applicable
to their shape, and as determined by the GM.

\begin{example}
A chair or table might run, a boulder might roll, and a book
might move with a caterpillar-like action, by opening and closing its
pages.
\end{example}

Their TMR will usually be about 4, but this amount could be halved for
very small objects, or ones whose mode of movement is slow (such as a
book).  The attack chances and damaging abilities of objects will be
determined by the GM, but will be uniformly low, and certainly no more
than 20\% (+ 2\% / Rank).  The general rule is the lighter and more
mobile an object, the greater its Strike Chance but the lower its
damage.  The reverse is also true.  The ``animate'' will cease to
function if the item is destroyed, the duration of the spell expires
or the General Knowledge Counterspell of the College of Binding and
Animating Magics is cast on the object.  ``Animates'' created by this
spell do not have Willpower or Magical Aptitude.  If ``animates'' are
created by this spell through the use of a Ward or Magical Trap, the
``animates'' will be uncontrolled, and thus do nothing, unless the
spell is triggered by the original caster.

d269 1
a269 15
\emph{Effects:}
By means of this spell the Adept records a verbal message into an
object, and defines the conditions under which the message will be
replayed.  This spell operates under all of the same area and
triggering conditions as the Ward ritual, except that a message is
stored instead of a spell.  The message is replayed exactly as the
Adept recorded it, and may contain any verbalisations that the Adept
is capable of.  The message may not exceed 5 words (+ 3 words / Rank).
Unlike the Ward ritual, the message may be triggered more than once
before the magic is exhausted.  The number of ``charges'' of the
message that is stored is equal to 1 (+ l per two full Ranks).  It
should be noted that although a message may be played more than once,
the message does not vary, it being set at the time of casting.  The
recorded message will remain until the ``charges'' are exhausted, or
the spell is counterspelled by the caster or a Namer.

d280 1
a280 1
\emph{Target:} Object, Animate, Undead Entity \\
d282 21
a302 46
\emph{Effects:}
This spell causes any one object, animate, or undead entity, to gain a
magical aura, or magical component to its aura.  The item affected may
be up to 20 cubic feet (+ 20 / Rank ) in size.  At low Ranks, the aura
created by the spell is weak, equivalent to ``Magic''.  As Rank is
gained with the spell, the strength of the aura increases to that of
``Formerly living as part of an object'', and so on up to ``Avatar''.
The strength of the aura is indistinguishable from that of the aura
category that it is equivalent to, and will cloak weaker auras in the
normal manner.

{\small \textbf{Example} The spell is cast at Rank 12 on a Zombie, a
``Non-sentient Undead''.  The Increased Aura will appear to be
``Living Animal'', and will cloak the Zombie's natural aura category.
A Namer who used the Detect Aura talent on the Zombie would be given
the information, ``Living Animal, generic true name Zombie''.}

The Increased Aura does not alter the target's aura in any other way.
The caster may always choose to cast the spell at a lower rank, so as
to create an aura weaker than their maximum allowable.  The strength
of the aura is dependent on the Rank of the spell:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{cl}
\textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Aura Equivalent} \\
0--1          & Magic \\
2--3          & Formerly  living  as  part  of   an   object \\
4--5          & Formerly living \\
6--7          & Living plants \\
8--9          & Non-sentient undead \\
10--11        & Living animals \\
12--13        & Sentient plant \\
14--15        & Sentient undead \\
16--17        & Short-living Sentient \\
18--19        & Long-living Sentient \\
20            & Avatar \\
\end{tabularx}

The duration of the spell is dependent upon Rank:
                                                           
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{cl}
\textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Maximum Duration} \\
0--9          & 30 minutes (+30 / Rank) \\                        
10--15        & 1 day (+l / Rank) \\
16--19        & 1 week (+l / Rank) \\

\end{tabularx}
d308 1
a308 1
\emph{Duration:} Permanent \\
d315 2
a316 28
\emph{Effects:}
Any single broken item weighing up to 10 pounds (+ 10 / Rank), or one
Golem, can be mended.  Note that a fractured item can only be made
whole if all pieces are present when the spell is enacted (if any are
missing, the repaired object will have a hole where the missing piece
would be).  A mended object becomes exactly as it was before it was
broken, so if it was deformed in some way (e.g., a sword that was
bent) it would retain that deformity.  Mending may only be used to fix
ordinary or unexceptional items (those created with an Effective Rank
of 0) unless the Binder possesses skill in the requisite trade at
least equal to the Rank with which the item was made.
   
{\small \textbf{Example} A warrior brings his broken battle-axe to
a Binder and asks her to mend it.  The axe was made at an effective
Rank of 5 by a Weaponsmith, and so normally the Binder could not mend
it. Fortunately for the warrior, the Binder is a Rank 7 Weaponsmith
and she may therefore use Mending to fix the axe.}

Magical items that are broken become mundane, and will remain mundane
even after the use of a Mending.  The Spell of Mending may be used on
a living creature that has been transformed into stone by magical
means or the special abilities of certain creatures and subsequently
broken.  This does require however, that the Binder be a Sculptor of
at least Rank 8. A Spell of Mending may be used to repair only
non-sentient Golems.  It may repair either Specific Grievous damage,
or general Endurance damage at a single cast but not both.  The amount
of EN ``healed'' will be up 1 point for every 2 full Ranks with this
spell.

\emph{Effects:}
A single, simple, common object familiar to the caster, appears in
their hands as they visualise it.  The object will be a common example
of its type and may not exceed 1 cubic foot (+ 1 per Rank) in volume,
nor 0.5 1b (+ 0.5 lb / Rank) in weight.  The object is physically real
with all normal attributes except its colour, which will be an
unnatural grey.  A colour cantrip may be used to rectify this.  The
object may not be visualised embedded in anything.  The object is
considered to be prepared and may be used in the pulse after the spell
is cast.  Complicated or fine quality items may not be created.
Examples of acceptable items include: a sack, a rope, a sheet of
paper, a simple mirror, a lockpick, or a sword.  Items that may not be
created include: flowers, (too complicated), gemstones (not common),
and most, if not all, food (flavours and smells are too complex).
When the Duration expires, the object vanishes.

This spell preserves and protects one object, animate, or undead
entity, of up to 20 cubic feet (+ 20 / Rank) against the effects of
time, decay, rust, erosion, wave action, etc. It does not confer any
protection against magical attacks (magical fire, whirlwind vortex,
etc).  It will protect bodies (formerly living or undead) from
decaying and rotting, but does not suspend time, with regard to
resurrection, poisons, curses, etc. The duration of the spell chosen
by the Adept at the time of casting, up to a maximum of:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{cl}
\textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Maximum Duration} \\
0--9    & 1 day (+ l / Rank) \\

d371 1
a371 18
\emph{Effects:}
A volume equal to 2 cubic feet (+ 2 / Rank) containing one of the four
material Elements (air, water, earth, fire) can be shaped by the Adept
into any form desired, and will retain that form for the duration of
the spell.  Thus, a sword of stone could be made, or a spear of fire
that could actually be thrown (although it would burn the hand of the
thrower).  A weapon created by this Spell is not considered to be a
magical weapon for the purposes of determining what it may harm.  The
spell cannot be cast over any living Entity or over an Elemental, and
sufficient quantity of the element to be shaped must be within the
Adept's range.  The quality of the object created will be ordinary and
unexceptional (such as those created with an Effective artisan Rank of
0) unless the Binder possesses skill in an appropriate trade.

\begin{example}
A Binder that was a Sculptor of rank 8 could use Spell of Shaping
Elements could be used to create a statue of exceptional beauty.

\emph{Range:} 10 feet + 5 / Rank \\
\emph{Duration:} 10 minutes + 10 / Rank \\
d397 1
a397 34
\emph{Effects:}
This spell causes a volume of non-living solid material to become as
transparent as high quality glass, but to otherwise retain its
original characteristics.  The volume that may be affected is a 1 foot
cube (+ 1 / Rank), and may be of any shape, provided that each cube
after the first is adjacent to another cube.  Note that this may
result in wasted volume if the object being affected is thin.  At the
time of casting the Adept may specify whether the volume is to be
transparent from both sides, or only from one side, in which case it
is transparent from the side from which the spell was cast. If the
volume may only be seen through one side, the other side will still
appear as it did before the spell was cast, and the Base Chance is
reduced by 10.

\subsubsection{Unbreakability (G-10)}

\begin{spelldesc}
\emph{Range:} 10 feet + 5 / Rank \\
\emph{Duration:} 10 minutes + 10 / Rank \\

\emph{Base Chance:} 25\% \\
\emph{Resist:} May not be resisted \\
\emph{Storage:} Investment, Ward, Magical Trap \\
\emph{Target:} Object \\
\end{spelldesc}
\emph{Effects:}
One object weighing up to 2 pounds (+ 2 / Rank) may be affected by
this spell so as to become almost unbreakable.  The item assumes a
strength slightly greater than that of steel. It cannot usually be
broken accidentally (such as in combat), but it can be damaged if it
is exposed to stresses well beyond those that steel could withstand,
given the object's size and shape.  Flexible objects may not be
affected by this spell.  Only objects that are naturally rigid may be
made unbreakable.

\emph{Actions:} Concentration \\
d413 1
a413 27
\emph{Effects:}
By means of this ritual, the Adept binds an object to the lifeforce of
a living Entity who is present throughout the entire Ritual, and who
may passively resist.  If the Ritual is successful, the object will
reflect the Entity's physical condition.  If the entity is well, the
object will be in perfect order.  If the Entity is sick or wounded the
object will show wear, wither somewhat, or redden, as appropriate, and
if the Entity dies the object will decay, wither away, or blacken.
There is no particular limitation on the size or type of the object
used, and traditional objects include apples, roses, paintings,
statues and diamonds.  The bond established by this ritual may be
broken by the destruction of the object, or by the entity and the
object being beyond range of one another.  Once the bond is broken,
simply mending the object or coming within range is not enough to
reestablish the bond.  The death or destruction of the entity does not
break the bond.

{\small \textbf{Example} An entity who has had their lifeforce bound to
a diamond dies, and the diamond turns black. If the entity is
subsequently resurrected the diamond would clear.}

The range of this linkage is 100 miles at Rank 0.  This distance is
increased by 100 miles for each rank achieved, and also for each 500sp
spent on precious ingredients for use in the ritual.  The distance is
assumed to be exceeded if the entity and the object occupy different
planes from one another, unless an additional 10,000sp (-500sp / Rank)
is spent on ingredients.

\subsubsection{Shaping Clay Golems (Q-2)}

\begin{spelldesc}
\emph{Duration:} 5 hours + 1 / Rank \\
\emph{Experience Multiple:} 300 \\
\emph{Base Chance:} 10\% + 4\% / Rank \\
\emph{Resist:} May not be resisted \\
\emph{Target:} Clay Statue \\
\emph{Cast Time:} 1 hour \\
\emph{Materials:} Clay \\
\emph{Actions:} Sculpting a Clay Statue \\
\emph{Concentration Check:} None \\
\end{spelldesc}
\emph{Effects:}
A Binder can use this ritual to shape clay into the form of a Golem.
The amount of clay required for the formation of a Clay Golem is equal
to the Golem's height, times half its height, times half its height,
as cubic feet.  One cubic foot of clay weighs between 112 and 162
pounds, depending on its water content.

{\small \textbf{Example} A 6' tall Clay Golem is made from 6 \x 3 \x 3,
or 54 cubic feet of clay.}

Once shaped, a clay Golem must be activated via Animation (G-2) before
its clay dries out, or it will be useless.  Clay Golems cannot be
reactivated.  The clay from which they are composed can be reshaped.
+3 is added to the Base Chance for each Rank that the Binder (or a
artisan taking part in the ritual) has in Sculpting or Pottery.  Clay
Golems have the following characteristics:

\textbf{Description:}
Clay Golems are bipedal, vaguely humanoid in form and features, and
between 4 and 8 feet in height.  The Golem is the colour and texture
of the clay from which it was formed.

\textbf{Talents, Skills and Magic:}
Clay Golems have no talents, skills, or magical abilities.

Some of the Golem's statistics are dependent on its size:

\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
&\textbf{4'}&\textbf{5'}&\textbf{6'}&\textbf{7'}&\textbf{8'}\\
PS &  5 &  7   &  9 & 12 & 15 \\ 
MD & 10 &  9   &  8 &  7 &  6 \\
AG &  8 &  7   &  6 &  5 &  4 \\
EN & 14 & 15   & 16 & 18 & 20 \\
FT & 15 & 18   & 20 & 26 & 30 \\
\end{tabular}

In all cases, the Rank of the Ritual is added to the Golem's Endurance
and Fatigue, and twice the Rank is added to its Physical Strength.

The Golem's other statistics are not dependent on its size:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{Movement Rate (yards per minute):} \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{Running: 100} \\
MA:      none	& PC:     10 \\
TMR:     2	& WP: 15 \\
PB: 8		& NA:      none \\
\end{tabular}

\textbf{Weapons:} Clay Golems can use any weapon they are physically
capable of using (see PS and MD requirements on the Weapons chart),
although they cannot have Rank with weapon.  They can attack with
their hands in Close or Melee Combat with a Base Chance of 40\% of
doing [D - 1] damage (+ l for every 3 points of PS above 15).

\textbf{Comments:} Clay Golems are mindless They can follow simple
commands (for example ``Attack him'', ``Carry these boulders to the
top of that hill'') but can do nothing complex.  They will only
follow the commands of their creator.

\subsubsection{Shaping Rag \& String Golems (Q-3)}

\begin{spelldesc}
\emph{Duration:} 1: Permanent; 2: 2 weeks / Rank (minimum 1) \\
\emph{Experience Multiple:} 250 \\
\emph{Base Chance:} 40\% + 3\% / Rank \\
\emph{Resist:} May not be resisted \\
\emph{Target:} 1: Gold Heart; 2: Golem \\
\emph{Cast Time:} 1: 1 hour; 2: 1 hour \\
\emph{Materials:} 1: 5 Gold Shillings; 2: Rags, String, Wood, Straw \\
\emph{Actions:} 1: Smelting \& fashioning a Gold Heart; 2: Making a Golem body \\
\emph{Concentration Check:} None \\
\end{spelldesc}
\emph{Effects:}
This Ritual allows the Binder to create small, helpful, intelligent
Golems.  The Ritual is performed in two distinct parts, but is
considered a single Ritual for the purposes of Ranking. Rag \& String
Golems have bodies fashioned out of bits of rag, string, and either
wood or straw, and have a heart made of gold.  The two parts of the
Ritual concern 1: Fashioning a heart of gold, and 2: Creating a Golem
body.

\textbf{Heart of Gold:}
By the use of this Ritual, the Binder creates a small heart made of
gold, and may imbue it with certain attributes and abilities.  The
material components of the heart are smelted during the Ritual, and
cast in the shape of a stylised heart.  The smelting and casting
requires that the Binder, or some other person taking part in the
Ritual is a artisan -- Gold / Silversmith or a artisan -- Founder /
Pewterer / Caster, of at least Rank 0.

When a gold heart is created, the Binder and any other characters who
willingly participate can imbue the heart with a number of abilities.
Up to 5 + (5 \x Binder's Rank with Q3) of Ranks of any spells, talents,
skills, weapon abilities, or linguistic knowledge can be imbued in the
heart.  Characteristics may be increased from the basic amount granted
to Rag \& String Golems, at a rate of 1 ``Rank'' to 1 point.  Two
``Ranks'', however, are subtracted from this maximum for every
separate ability bestowed, or characteristic enhanced.

{\small \textbf{Example} A heart is formed by a Binder with Rank 5 (in
Q3). Up to 30, (5 + (5 \x 5)) Ranks of abilities could be put into the
heart (-2 for every separate ability).  Thus the heart could be imbued
with Rank 2 Healer, Rank 0 Spy, Rank 4 with a Dagger, Rank 2 in a
language, Rank 3 in the Spell of Mending, Rank 3 with the Sling, and
+2 PS, totalling 16 Ranks - the maximum possible as the heart has 7
separate abilities [30 - (7x2)] = 16).}

No ability can be imbued in the heart unless the Binder or some other
character participating in the ritual has Rank in the ability at least
twice that of the Rank being imbued.  Endurance and Fatigue may never
be raised, and no attribute may be raised above the maximum shown for
these Golems.  A heart may not be imbued with Ritual magic, nor can it
ever receive spells or talents from more than 1 College.  A heart
automatically receives its Binder's primary language at half the
Binder's Rank (round up). This ability does not count against the
total that can be imbued in the heart.

At the conclusion of the 1 hour Ritual, the Binder must make a Cast
Check to determine if the Ritual has succeeded.  If the Check is
successful, the Binder immediately imbues the heart with 1 (or more,
if they wish) points of permanent Endurance.  Any Golem created using
this heart will possess an Endurance equal to 3 \x the Endurance
bestowed on the heart (maximum 30).  Endurance lost to a heart by this
Ritual may not be healed; it must be ``bought'' back in the same way
as if the caster had died.  The heart is now complete.

When a Binder achieves greater Rank with to this Ritual, they may wish
to ``upgrade'' existing hearts.  To do this they enact this Ritual,
and they or other characters present may imbue the heart with extra
Ranks and/or new abilities etc.  equal to the difference between the
number of ``Ranks'' stored in the heart, and the new maximum available
to the Binder.  Abilities may be enhanced or added; they may not be
substituted or removed.  No cast Check need be made to upgrade a
heart; the Ritual is automatically successful.  The Binder need not
add Endurance to the heart, but may do so if they wish.  Endurance may
not be removed.  ``Upgrading'' the heart in this way will also
increase the amount of time for which the Rag \& String Golem with
this heart may be activated.

Gold hearts may be carried ``deactivated'' for an indefinite period
without affecting their utility.

\textbf{Creating Rag \& String Golem Bodies:}
By use of this Ritual, the Binder creates a small Golem out of bits of
rag and string and either wood or straw (which must be available to
perform the ritual), and implants in it a heart of gold (which must
have been made previously).  Once the Ritual is successfully
completed, Animation (G-2) must be successfully cast over a Rag \&
String Golem within 5 minutes (+ 1 / Rank), or the Golem will fall
apart, and a new body must he crafted.

\textbf{Rag \& String Golems:}
These Golems are 1 to 2 feet tall and are humanoid in form.  They
appear much like marionettes, and could conceivably be mistaken for
such.  Their skin will have the colour and texture of wood or straw,
and they appear clothed in the rags from which they were formed.
Their personality and abilities are stored in their gold heart and
will be the same from activation to activation.  If this is the first
time that a particular Golem has been activated, a cast check must be
made.  Golems whose hearts have been used before will retain all the
memories that they had up to the point of their last deactivation.
They will have no sense of the time that has passed while they have
been inactive.  The personality of a Golem will remain constant across
activations, being initially a caricature of the Binder who created
their heart.  The personality of a Golem may change over time, such as
gaining a slight fear of fire, if they were burnt in one of their
previous activations.

Rag \& String Golems are by far the most intelligent of Golems.  They
can receive and carry out very complicated instructions without flaw.
They can also converse with their Binder and any other being with whom
they share a language.  These Golems can act freely and modify the
letter of their orders to follow the perceived intent behind them.
Commands can thus be given in general terms, and the Golems will
improvise as they go along.  Rag \& String Golems will always serve
their creator faithfully, suppressing their normally curious and
mischievous natures, in order to do so.  They will never serve anyone
other than their creator except during very limited periods (less
than a day) and at their creator's request.  Rag \& String Golems
consider their creator to be the Binder who created and animated their
present body.  They will not be troubled by the fact that they may
have served other creators.  This one is the ``new boss'', and that's
that.  If a Golem's creator dies while the Golem is animate, the Golem
may act independently, and will attempt to ensure their own survival.
They will remain loyal to their dead creator, and will do what they
can to try and get them ``mended'', that is resurrected.  If this is
not possible, the Golem will usually wander off to investigate the
world.

When a Binder animates a Rag \& String Golem, they must ``loan'' the
Golem half of the Golem's Fatigue.  The Binder may loan the Golem no
less than 2 Fatigue, and up to 10 Fatigue, and the Golem's Fatigue
characteristic will be twice the amount ``loaned''.  Fatigue
``loaned'' to a Golem is lost to the Binder, and may not be regained
in any way until the Golem is deactivated.  When the Golem is
deactivated, the Binder does not actually get the Fatigue back, but
the Fatigue may now be regained in the normal manner.

A Rag \& String Golem may be deactivated by:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item
Being killed (losing all its Endurance).
\item
By having the General Knowledge Counterspell of the College of Binding
and Animating Magics cast over it in the form of a Dissipation by a
Namer.
\item
By having Deactivating Golems (S4) cast over it.
\end{enumerate}

Once deactivated, a Rag \& String Golem's body is useless, and a new
one must be crafted before it may be reactivated.  Only if the Golem's
gold heart is destroyed is the Golem permanently ``dead''.  Neither
Dissipation, nor Deactivating Golems has any effect on a gold heart.

Rag \& String Golems have the following characteristics:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{ll}
\multicolumn{2}{l}{Movement Rate (yards per minute:)} \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{Running: 100} \\
PS: 5--15  & MD: 10--20 \\

\end{tabularx}

\textbf{Weapons:}
Rag \& String Golems can use any weapons allowed by their PS and MD.
They can use armour and shields, but their spell casting ability is
affected by the presence of cold iron exactly as the ability of a
normal Adept.

\emph{Effects:}
This  ritual  allows  the  Binder  to   either:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item
Turn one entity, that has been turned to stone by enchanted creatures or
magical means, back into flesh.
\item
Turn one living, formerly living or undead entity to marble-like
stone.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Turning Stone to Flesh:}
Only entities that are naturally flesh, but have been turned to stone,
are affected by this ritual.  Any clothing or other items that were
turned to stone with a figure are restored to their normal state with
that figure.  This usage of the ritual may not be resisted.

\textbf{Turning Flesh to Stone:}
Any clothing or other items on the entity are turned to stone along
with the figure.  The entity must be present for the entire duration
of the ritual and must fail to resist.  Bodies are effectively
preserved while stone, with regard to resurrection, poison, curses,
etc., nor do entities who are turned to stone notice the passage of
time.  Note that Entities who are not dead when they are turned to
stone, but are subsequently shattered are not technically dead until
the stoning effect is removed.  If a shattered stone entity is turned
back to flesh, they will then be dead (if the amount of shattering
would be enough to kill a living being) and time of death may be
computed from that point for the purposes of resurrection, etc.
Shattered entities may be repaired while in their stone state by the
use of Mending (G-5), provided that the Binder is a Sculptor of at
least Rank 8.

\emph{Effects: }
The corpses of beings who were once alive retain a certain
``sympathy'' for living, and are easier to animate than those objects
that have never lived.  By means of this spell, the Adept may fill 2
(+ l per 2 or fraction Ranks) human-sized corpses within range, with
the power of undeath, giving them a gruesome semblance of life.  The
undead so created will serve the Adept in all ways.  The Undead will
obey simple commands communicated verbally by the Adept.  Corpses that
possess most of their flesh will become Zombies; those that are mostly
devoid of flesh will become Skeletons.  If this spell is used on
corpses of other than human size, the following strictures apply:
larger than human-sized corpses count as 1 corpse per hex; smaller
than human-sized corpses count as fractions of a corpse -- dog, 0.5;
cat, 0.2; rat, 0.1.  No more than 10 small corpses, even if smaller
than rat-sized, may be animated in the place of 1 human-sized
corpse.  If this spell is cast as the result of a Ward or Magical
Trap, the re-animated dead will be uncontrolled and will attack any
living beings they can reach.

\emph{Resist:} May only be passively resisted \\
d486 1
a486 1
\emph{Target:} Volume \\
d488 21
a508 37
\emph{Effects:}
The spell causes an iridescent bubble of force to appear.  The size of
the bubble is dependent on the Rank of the caster.  At Ranks 0--10, it
is 5 feet in radius, at 11--15, 10 feet, and at 16--20, 15 feet.
All of the bubble must appear within the caster's range.  The bubble
may enclose any and/or all entities and objects completely within the
target hexes.  Every target that may be enclosed is entitled to a
passive resistance check, except those occupying the centre hex of a 3
hex diameter bubble.  If the target resists, they are pushed aside by
the bubble as it appears, and will end adjacent to it.  Targets who
fail to resist, or who are not entitled to a resistance check, are
enclosed by the bubble.  The substance of the bubble is entirely
impervious to heat, cold, physical force, fire, water, earth, air or
other gases, magic and elanic abilities.  It is transparent to light
and sound, so normal sight and conversation may be carried out through
it, but it suppresses the amount of light or sound passing through it,
to non-damaging levels.  The bubble is impervious from both sides.  It
also absorbs physical damage, including that caused by falling, so as
to protect the entities or objects within it.  Inside, it provides a
stable, warm, and dry environment, with fresh air to breathe.  The
surface of the bubble feels hard to the touch, somewhat like glass.
The bubble may be rolled on a solid surface, by an entity within it,
by entities outside, or by a very strong wind or similar physical
force.  It will tend to wallow in mud, lava, or similar semi-solid
substances, will float on water and may be carried by wind and
current.  The only magical or elanic abilities that will function
through the bubble are those that are entirely passive (i.e.,  ones that
only receive what the target is broadcasting) in nature, e.g.,  Detect
Aura, ESP and Healer non-tactile empathy.  The bubble is not simply
impenetrable to ``beam'' type magic; it will not pass magic at all.
It may not be targeted through.  That is ``beam'' type magic will
splash over the Bubble, but a Sleep spell will simply not effect an
entity inside the bubble, if cast from outside, for instance.  It must
be noted that when this spell is cast ``at ground level'' it is a
spherical bubble that appears, not a hemisphere above ground and a
hemisphere below.  The whole bubble is above ground.  If the spell is
cast in a gas, the gas is displaced outside the bubble.  If cast in a
d510 1

surface.  The spell may not be cast inside a solid substance, or where

20\%.  Note that this spell will be ineffective against Golems made
permanent by the use of Binding Permanency (R-3).

\emph{Effects: }
A number of contiguous surfaces of non-living solid material,
totalling an area of 20 (+ 10 / Rank) feet square, and all within the
Adept's range, become nearly frictionless.  The effect is somewhat
similar to wet ice.  Little grip can be made on these surfaces, and no
handholds can be found on walls under this effect.  Every entity
attempting to move on one of the frictionless surfaces must roll less
than or equal to their Agility on D100, every pulse, or they will fall
prone.  If an entity does fall, a similar roll must be made before it
can stand again, and while prone, its momentum will usually carry it
in the direction it was travelling, and at its previous speed, until
it clears the frictionless area.  The effect is not visible by normal
means, but the area so affected does gain a magical aura, or magical
component to its aura.

d592 1
a592 20
\emph{Effects: }
The Adept instills one object with the power of flight.  The object
may not be larger than 2 cubic feet (+ 2 / Rank) in volume.  The Adept
may cause the object to fly, provided that they remain in contact with
it, and maintain passive concentration.  If the Adept's contact with
the object, or their concentration is broken, the spell dissipates and
must be recast to once more be effective.  The spell will also
dissipate if the object is destroyed.  Parts of the object that are
broken off will not possess the power of flight.  Whilst the spell is
in effect the Adept may cause the object to fly at up to 20 miles per
hour (+ 2 mph / Rank).  The spell will support the object and up to
150 lbs (+ 50 lbs / Rank) in weight.  It must be noted that it is the
object and not the Adept that is flying, and that this will limit the
usability of some objects.  Examples of objects that are particularly
useful for this spell are rugs, tables, and four poster beds, whilst
some of those of dubious worth are swords, rings, and bracelets.
Broomsticks or boots are only recommended for the experienced flyer.
Because all parts of the affected object are flying equally,
naturally flexible objects, such as carpets, gain sufficient rigidity
to support riders.

a612 2
\emph{Duration:} Concentration: 1 hour + 1 / Rank \\
\emph{Experience Multiple:} 350 \\
d618 1
a618 23
\emph{Effects:}
Whilst under the effects of a Spell of Making, the Adept is able to
construct and craft as though their hands were various common tools.
The hands do not take on the appearance of the tool being mimicked,
but rather the effect.  The Adept simply runs their hands over the
material being worked on, and wills changes to that material.  Thus
the Adept may create a saw-cut along a plank, and then nail that
plank, into place, or craft stone into a statue, as though they were
using a hammer and chisel.  This spell in no way enhances the Adept's
ability at any of the crafts they are attempting to perform, nor does
it provide construction materials of any sort or reduce the amount of
time that it would take to do the crafting normally.  The spell in no
way protects the Adept against the hazards of working some materials,
such as extremes of temperature, or corrosive properties.  The Adept
may freely change from the mimicry of one tool to another without
having to re-cast the spell.  The degree of concentration involved
guarantees that the spell will be broken if the Adept engages in
combat or casts (but not triggers) another spell.  Within these
limitations the Adept may move about freely and engage in other
activities.  The tools that may be mimicked must be reasonably
common and simple, and include: adze, auger, chisel, crowbar, hammer,
hatchet, level, pickaxe, plane, pliers, plumb-bob, rock drill, saw,
shovel, sickle, spokeshave, square, tongs, and mallet.

By means of this spell, the caster may transform a volume of matter

must be formerly or never living.  The volume to be affected is up to
2 cubic feet (+ 2 / Rank).  The matter must retain its present
``state'' (i.e., a solid may only be transformed into a different
solid, a gas into a different gas, etc).  The matter transformed will
retain its original size, and if solid, shape, but not necessarily
mass, density, toughness, etc.  The matter assumes all of the physical
characteristics of the matter it is transformed into.  The caster must
have some familiarity with the matter into which the volume is to be
transformed.

a642 1
\emph{Target:} Object \\
d644 4
a647 24
\emph{Effects:}
Using this spell the Adept is able to observe the resonances (a sort
of psychic residue) set up in an object, left by previous spirits to
have come into contact with it.  A successful casting will gain the
caster a feeling of the strongest resonance inherent in the item,
which will usually be the most emotional or traumatic event the item
has been a part of.  For instance, a dinner knife that has been used
to murder someone will leave the Adept with the feeling that the item
has been involved in a traumatic death, as this resonance will
overshadow the gentler resonances left by the knife's previous owner
as he enjoyed eating turkey with it.  If a double effect is achieved,
the Adept will gain a brief flash of the visual images associated with
the resonance read, such as the knife being plunged into someone.  If
a triple effect is achieved, a more detailed image is gained, such as
a glimpse of the murderer perhaps.  The clarity and usefulness of the
images are very much left to the GM's discretion.  There is no
definite size limit on the object being read.  This is instead limited
to one ``item'', such as the floor of one room, rather than the whole
floor of the building.  Once the Adept has read a particular object's
resonances, no further information may be gained unless a new,
stronger resonance occurs.  Also, the Adept may always identify an
object they have read, as they are familiar with the object's inherent
vibrations.  The identification may only be done by casting this
spell.

\emph{Base Chance:} 15\% \\

\emph{Storage:} None \\
\emph{Target:} Object \\
\end{spelldesc}
\emph{Effects:}
By means of this spell the Adept enchants an object so that it will
animate when certain conditions are met, and will then perform a set
of instructions.  Both the animating condition and the instructions
the ``Animate'' is to follow are imbued at the time of casting this
spell.  The object affected may not exceed 100 pounds (+ 20 pounds /
Rank) in weight.  The orders may not exceed 10 (+ 1 / Rank) words in
length.  The triggering conditions for the animation are the same as
for the Ward Ritual, except that the area of the ``Ward'' is 1 foot
(+5 feet / Rank) rather than the spell's own range.  In addition, the
conditions may include physical contact with the object.

{\small \textbf{Example} Valid triggering conditions could be: ``When
knocked on three times'', ``When an Elf approaches'', ``When an Orc
touches you"''.}

Once the object animates it will attempt to fulfil the orders
programmed into it.  The ``Animate'' will possess rudimentary
intelligence and senses, sufficient for it to follow the caster's
orders.  If an ``Animate'' is to move, it will move about in a manner
congrous with its shape, and as determined by the GM.  Its Tactical
Movement Rate will usually be about 4, but this amount could be halved
for very small objects, or ones whose mode of movement is slow (such
as a book).  The attack chances and damaging abilities of objects will
be determined by the GM, but will be uniformly low, and certainly no
more than 20\% (+ 2\% / Rank).  The general rule is that the lighter
and more mobile an object, the greater its Strike Chance, but the
lower the damage.  The reverse is also true.  The ``Animate'' will
cease to function once the item is destroyed, the ``Animate'' fulfils
its orders, the spell is Dissipated, or in any case, after 1 hour (+ l
/ Rank) has passed.  An object may remain dormant for an indefinite
period of time before animating.  ``Animates'' created by this spell
do not have Willpower or Magical Aptitude.

d660 1

\emph{Effects:}
By means of this spell the caster breaks the bonds that hold material
matter together, within a volume of 2 cubic feet (+ 2 / Rank).  This
volume may be of any shape provided that no dimension measures less
then one foot.  This volume may contain no more than 1 entity (+ 1
entity per 10 full ranks).  It may be cast on part of an entity, but
that entity will still count as a whole for the purpose of the
number of entities affected.

\begin{example}
At Rank 10 the caster may affect 2 entities,
or parts thereof, provided that both are within a 22 cubic foot
volume. The effect of the Unbinding will vary with the matter
affected.  Rock will collapse into dust, water into vapour, and
organic entities into a sort of soup.  The parts of an entity affected
by this spell are not usable for purposes of resurrection.

\emph{Effects:}
This spell summons and binds together particles of dust and/or sand to
create a wall with the strength and solidity of sandstone.  The wall
is 16 feet tall \x 20 feet long \x 1 foot thick, or a ring 10 feet
high x 10 feet diameter \x 1 foot thick, or a pillar 15 feet high \x 4
feet diameter.  The caster may increase any dimension by 1 foot per
Rank.  The caster may determine the position and orientation of the
wall, but at least one edge must be affixed to a solid surface.  The
fixed edge of the wall will bind fast to the surface it is adjacent
to, and may support the rest of the wall, thus creating roofs and
overhangs.  Any entity that is within the area of the wall when it is
cast will simply be ``ejected'' to either side of the wall, with equal
chance, suffering no harm.  If for some reason an entity cannot be
ejected from the area of the wall, the wall will simply not appear.
At the end of the spell's duration the component particles of the wall
will vanish back to wherever they came from.

d686 1
a686 23
\emph{Effects:}
By means of this spell the Adept may pass through solid matter, such
as a wall or tree, as though it were soft butter.  Entities under the
affect of this spell cannot pass through cold iron.  The Adept has an
effective TMR of 1 whilst inside solid matter.  This movement may be
made in any direction, including up and down.

\begin{example}
An Adept in a castle could walk into a wall on one level, ``swim'' up
to the next and then exit the wall.
\end{example}

This spell confers no particular ability to see whilst inside solid
matter.  The Adept may, however, breath normally.  If the duration of
the spell expires whilst the Adept is still within solid matter, they
are trapped, though not necessarily immediately dead.  Their ability
to breathe inside the matter will dissipate along with the spell.
Whilst under the effects of this spell the Adept is virtually immune
to physical damage, except that done by cold iron.  Conversely it is
very hard for the Adept to do physical damage to others, for if the
weapon wielded is a possession it will pass harmlessly, through the
intended target, and if it is somehow not a possession it will be
forced back into the Adept rather than the target.

Through this ritual, the Binder can answer the exact nature of all
enchantments, mechanisms, curses, side-effects, etc, placed upon an
item.  Note that if an item has been imbued with an Individual True
Name the Name will not be revealed, but the fact that the item has a
Name will be.

\emph{Effects:}
This ritual allows a Binder to greatly increase the potency of the
Investment Ritual (R5), allowing an invested item to be recharged by
any mage of the appropriate college who has the applicable spell at a
high enough Rank.

This ritual is cast in conjunction with the Investment Ritual (R5),
creating a two hour Ritual.  The Ritual establishes the rank at which
the spell will be cast for a particular object or item.  The Rank
reductions specified in R-5 apply, but it is this Ritual that sets the
maximum number of charges that the item may receive.  The item may
never contain more charges than the number set at its creation.  The
ritual can imbue an item with a number of charges equal to:
\begin{quote}
Binder's Rank / 2 (round down), if the Binder is investing their own
spell, or Binder's Rank / 3 (round down), if the Binder is investing
another Adept's spell.
\end{quote}

In either case the ``Binder's Rank'' is the Rank of the Binder with R5
or R-2, whichever is less.

\begin{example}
A Binder who knows the Investment Ritual at Rank 4, and Binding
Charges at Rank 6, works in conjunction with an Adept of the College
of Celestial Magics who knows the spell Blackfire at Rank 10, to
create a charged wand to cast that spell. With the successful Casting
of R2 and R5, the created wand could cast the spell at Rank 3 (Rank 10
- 7 Ranks, see R-5), and could contain 1 charge (Binder's Rank with R-5
/ 3 (round down)).  Note that the Binder could have created the wand
to cast at Rank 2 or less if so desired.
\end{example}

The object can be recharged by any Adept of the same college (and
branch, if applicable) as the one who contributed the spell, provided
that they know the spell at a Rank at least equal to the Rank stored.
They can recharge the item by engaging in at least 1 hour's Ritual
preparation, and then ``loosing'' the spell ``into'' the object.  No
roll is made to determine the success, failure, or back-fire of the
spell, the cast check being made when the spell is released, as per
normal invested items.  Each ``re-charge'' restores 1 charge to the
item, up to its maximum, and causes the Adept doing the recharging to
lose Fatigue as if they had cast normally.  The triggering chance will
always remain as per the original, despite the fact that the
re-charging Adept may have a higher, or lower Base Chance.

\emph{Effects:}
By means of this ritual, the Adept may enhance the Duration of their
spells and rituals to ``Permanent''.  Only General and Special
Knowledge spells and rituals of the College of Binding and Animating
Magics may be used in conjunction with this ritual. The ritual may
only be performed by the same Adept that cast the spell or ritual to
be affected.  The Adept must first cast the spell or ritual that they
desire to make permanent and then immediately begin this ritual.  This
ritual takes 1 hour to perform and the spell or ritual must still be
in effect at the end of the ritual.  Therefore the Duration of the
spell or ritual at the time that it is cast must be at least 1 hour.
This may mean that some spells may not be used with this ritual until
considerable Rank has been gained with them.  This ritual may not be
used on Concentration spells, nor with spells or rituals with
indefinite Duration, such as those that remain until triggered (e.g.,
Bound Speech, Investment) or those whose Duration is Immediate.  It
will have no effect on spells or rituals that already have a permanent
Duration.  A spell that has been enhanced by use of this ritual may
not be Counterspelled, but it may still be Dissipated.  A Golem that
has had its ``animation'' made permanent may not be deactivated by
Deactivating Golems (S4), though its Animation may still be
dissipated.  Material costs to perform this ritual are: 10,000sp (-
400sp / Rank) for General Knowledge Spells, 20,000sp (- 800sp / Rank)
for Special Knowledge spells and 30,000sp (- 1200sp / Rank) for
Rituals.  In all cases the Rank referred to is that of this Ritual.

\emph{Effects:}
By means of this ritual the Adept may manipulate the psychic
resonances of an object, so as to obliterate other resonances, create
new ones, or emit low-powered emotional vibrations.  The object to be
affected may no be larger than 4 cubic feet (+ 4 / Rank).  The Adept
may choose to perform one of the following three options, and must
specify which at the time of casting.

{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{description}
\item[Removing Resonances]
The Adept may obliterate the strongest or all resonances in the
object.

\item[Creating Resonances]
The Adept may instill a new ``strongest'' resonance.  This resonance
may be as vague or as detailed the Adept wishes, and may, in effect,
be a message left for another Adept.

\item[Edit Emotions]
The Adept may cause the object to emit an ``emotion'' that will affect
any entities within 5 feet (+ 2 / Rank) of the object unless they
Passively Resist.  Emotions that may be emitted include: discomfort,
mild fear, irritability, peacefulness, and tiredness.  The emotion
must be specified at the time of casting.  The transmitted emotion is
not very powerful and will certainly not force any entity to do
anything that they no not wish to do.  It merely serves to worry,
scare slightly or conversely, put at ease, entities that would not
otherwise feel these things.  Non-sentient entities will not willingly
approach an object that emits fear, for instance, but a sentient
might.  The sentient would be aware that they felt somewhat scared,
though they would not necessarily know why.  Once manipulated, the
resonance will remain until the object's resonances are manipulated
further, the item picks up a very strong resonance from a particularly
traumatic event, or the item is destroyed.
\end{description}}

\subsubsection{Investment (R-5)}

Except as noted below, this ritual is identical to the ritual of the
same name to be found in the section Special Magical Preparations (\S
\ref{magic:preparation}).  Adepts of this College learn this Ritual of
Investment instead of the one listed in the section Special Magical
Preparations.  A Binder may invest either a spell of their own, or one
of a willing Adept who participates in the full ritual.  However, if
the spell being invested is contributed by another mage, a number of
charges equal to only half the Binders Rank (rounded up) are
stored. In addition, the rank at which the spell is stored is
dependent on the Rank of the Binder with this ritual as follows:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{cl}
\textbf{Rank (R-5)} & \textbf{Spell Rank Stored} \\
1--3	& Spell  Rank - 8 \\
4--6	& Spell  Rank - 7 \\
7--9	& Spell  Rank - 6 \\
10--11	& Spell  Rank - 5 \\
12--13	& Spell Rank - 4 \\
14--15	& Spell Rank - 3 \\
16--17	& Spell Rank - 2 \\
18--19	& Spell Rank - 1 \\
20	& Spell Rank \\
\end{tabularx}

In all cases the spell to be stored cannot be reduced in rank below
zero.  A spell reduced to below rank zero may not be invested.

d787 3
a789 102
\emph{Effects:}
This ritual is used to fashion a Golem from parts of different
corpses.  All pieces that are to go into the Golem must be found
before the ritual can begin.  In addition to the pieces of corpse and
precious ingredients, the services of a Taxidermist or Undertaker of
at least Rank 6 are needed for this ritual.  Flesh Golems need not be
animated immediately following their creation, but each day that goes
by lowers the chance of activation by 3\%.  Once animated, a flesh
Golem will remain active until it is killed.  A Flesh Golem will
always obey its creator, but the GM must determine the complexity of
commands it is capable of executing based on the intelligence of the
brain used to fashion the Golem.  This ritual is automatic, but there
is a 1\% chance of an accident each week during a Flesh Golem's
creation.  If there is an accident, check the Golem Accident Table to
determine the exact result.  It must be noted that the creation of a
Flesh Golem is an inexact science, and no two Flesh Golems seem to
tum out the same.  Even building a second Golem using identical
materials rarely results in the same final creature.  Flesh Golems
have the following characteristics:


{\setlength\leftmargini{0.5em}
\begin{description}
\item[Description]
A flesh Golem can be put together from different creatures within a
species, or from any number of different species.  For example, a
troll could be fashioned with the brains of a human, and the wings of
a gargoyle, or an ogre could be made with the strength of one ogre
(presumably a powerful one), the endurance of another hardy one, and
the brain of a bight ogre.  Seams will show wherever parts are sewn
together, and at low Ranks, the Golem will exude a horrible, rotting
odour.  By Rank 6, the odour will only be noticeable in very close
proximity to the Golem, and above Rank 10 the odour will only be
noticed by canines, and other creatures with an exceptional sense of
smell.

\item[Talents, Skills and Magic]
Flesh Golems never retain any of the skills or spell casting abilities
(although they do retain some weapon skills) of any of the creatures
from which they are made. They do retain any talents appropriate to
the parts of a creature used.  Thus, a Golem made with the eyes of a
basilisk would be able to turn creatures to stone in the same manner
as a basilisk.

\item[Movement Rate]
Variable, according to the Golem's size and method(s) of locomotion.

\item[PS]
Average the Physical Strength of the creatures from which the Golem's
muscle tissues were taken.

\item[MD]
Average the Manual Dexterities of the creatures from which the Golem's
muscles and brain were taken.

\item[AG]
Average the Agilities of the creatures from which the Golem's muscles
and brain were taken.

\item[MA] 0

\item[EN]
Average the Endurances of the creatures from which the Golem's
muscles and internal organs were taken.

\item[FT]
As for Endurance, but the creature from which the Golem's lungs were
taken counts twice within the average.

\item[WP]
Add 5 to the Willpower of the creature from which the Golem's brain
was taken.  Maximum 30.

\item[PC]
Variable, depending on the quality of the eyes, ears, and mental
faculties of the creatures that were used, but never more than 10 (+
Rank / 2 rounded up).

\item[PB]
Variable, depending on the creatures used, but never more than 6 (+
Rank).

\item[TMR]
Variable depending on Agility and GM's discretion.

\item[NA]
Variable, depending on the creature from which the skin was taken.

\item[Weapons]
A flesh Golem can use any natural weapons (such as claws and fangs)
built into it, as well as any weapons it can carry.  It will have the
same Ranks in weapons as the creature who contributed its brain
divided by 2 and rounded down.  This is knowledge only, and there is
no guarantee that the Golem will have the requisite PS or MD, or will
even be able to manipulate weapons.

\item[Comments]
The GM will have to use discretion in allowing combinations of
creatures.  It would be absurd to allow a Golem to be built with a
dragon's head on a human body -- due to discrepancies in size, for
instance.  Flesh Golems can be harmed by weapons or magic as per
normal.

d808 2
a809 56
\emph{Effects:}
A Binder can use this ritual to cast a Golem from iron.  The casting
requires a blacksmith of at least Rank 6.  The amount of metal
required for the formation of an Iron Golem is equal to the Golem's
height, times half its height, times a third of its height, as cubic
feet.

\begin{example}
A 6' tall Iron Golem is made from, 6' \x 3' \x 2', or 36 cubic feet of
metal.
\end{example}

The Binder may substitute other metals for iron (brass, bronze, etc.)
if they feel so inclined, but the effect is only cosmetic.  The Golem
will possess the same statistics regardless of the metal from which it
is formed.  The weight of 1 cubic foot of metal varies, depending on
what metal is used.  The weights per cubic foot for some metals are:
brass, 530; bronze, 550, iron, 480; lead, 710; copper, 560; silver,
655; gold, 1205; platinum, 1340; truesilver, 1500.  If precious metals
are used to form the Golem, the value of the metal must be added to
the cost of the materials used in the ritual.  A 6' high Silver Golem
is worth nearly 4 million silver pennies in metal content alone!
This ritual is automatic, but there is a 1\% chance of an accident
each week during an Iron Golem's casting.  If there is an accident,
check the Golem Accident Table (\ref{binder:accidents}) to determine
the exact result.  Iron Golems have the following characteristics:

{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{description}

\item[Description]
Iron Golems are figures of iron, standing between 6 and 10 feet tall,
and are humanoid in shape.  Gemstones are often used for their eyes.
Weapons will often be built into the arms or legs of these Golems as
living parts of their bodies.

\item[Talents, Skills and Magic]
Iron Golems have Rank 5 with any weapon built into them.  There is no
MD requirement for such a weapon.  If the maximum Rank of a weapon
that they are cast with is less than 5, the Golem will instead have
maximum Rank with the weapon.

Some of the Golem's statistics are dependent on the size it is made:

\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
&\textbf{6'}&\textbf{7'}&\textbf{8'}&\textbf{9'}&\textbf{10'}\\
PS &  20 &  25 & 30 & 35 &  40 \\
MD &  12 &  10 &  9 &  8 &   7 \\
AG &  10 &   8 &  7 &  6 &   5 \\
EN &  25 &  27 & 29 & 32 &  35 \\
FT &  25 &  28 & 31 & 35 &  40 \\
\end{tabular}

In all cases, twice the Rank of the Ritual is added to the Golem's
Endurance, Fatigue and Physical Strength.  The Golem's other
statistics are not dependent on its size:

\end{tabular}

\item[Weapons]
An Iron Golem may be cast with any weapon, except missile weapons, and
use it regardless of the normal MD requirement.  They must, however,
satisfy the MD requirement to use any weapon they were not cast with.
Weapons that are built in can break but they cannot be dropped.  Iron
Golems can be cast with, or carry shields, but cannot wear armour.
Iron Golems can attack with their hands in Melee Combat with a Base
Chance of 40\% (+ 2\% per Binder's Rank), or in Close Combat with a
Base Chance of 55\% (+ 2\% per Binder's Rank).  In either case the
damage is D10 (+ 1 per 3 points of PS above 15).  Note that the
Natural Armour of an Iron Golem represents the difficulty in damaging
its metallic form.  The Natural Armour rating of the Golem is deducted
from all blows striking it, even those inflicting Endurance or
Specific Grievous Damage.

\item[Comments]
Iron Golems are mindless killing machines.  They can perform only
simple commands, but become deadly fighters once in combat.  Iron
Golems cannot be stunned.  Once shaped, an Iron Golem is inanimate
until Animation (G-2) is cast over it.  There is no detrimental effect
to leaving an Iron Golem dormant for a period of time before the spell
is cast.  Once the Duration of the activation expires the Golem
reverts to an iron statue, but can be re-animated by G-2.

a839 56
\emph{Effects:}
A Binder can use this ritual to craft a Golem of stone.  The crafting
requires a sculptor or mason of at least Rank 6. The Golem is carved
from a solid block of stone.  The amount of stone required for the
formation of a Stone Golem is equal to the Golem's height, times half
its height, times half its weight, as cubic feet.  Approximately 10\%
of the block is carved away, and wasted during the creation process.

\begin{example}
A 10' tall Stone Golem is made from a single
block of stone, 10' \x 5' \x 5', or 250 cubic feet of stone, 25 cubic
feet of which is carved away and wasted.
\end{example}

The weight of 1 cubic foot of stone varies, depending on what stone is
used.  The weight per cubic foot for some stone is: granite, 170 lb;
marble, 175 lb; pyrite, 310 lb; quartz, 165 lb; sandstone, 140 lb;
malachite, 245 lb.  The ritual is automatic, but each week during the
Golem's construction there is a 1\% chance of an accident.  If such
occurs, the GM should roll on the Golem Accident Table
(\ref{binder:accidents}) to determine the effect.  Stone Golems have
the following characteristics:

{\setlength\leftmargini{1.0em}
\begin{description}

\item[Description]
Stone Golems are usually bipedal, humanoid in shape, though very broad
and heavily built, and 8 to 12 feet tall.  Stone Golems may be made
quadrupedal, or even centauroid, if their creator so desires.  Golems
that are non-humanoid in shape use the same statistics, but are
somewhat shorter in length, than the height they would be if bipedal.

\begin{example}
A 10' Stone Golem that was made to look like
a horse would use the same statistics as a normal 10' Golem, but would
be approximately 7' in length.
\end{example}

Their bodies will be the colour and texture of the stone from which
they were carved.

\item[Talents, Skills and Magic]
Stone Golems have no talents, skills, or magical abilities.

Some of the Golem's statistics are dependent on the size it is made:


\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
&\textbf{8'}&\textbf{9'}&\textbf{10'}&\textbf{11'}&\textbf{12'}\\
PS  & 20 & 23 & 27 & 31 & 35 \\

\item[Weapons]
Stone Golems can use any weapon they are physically capable of using
(see PS and MD requirements on the Weapons chart) although they
cannot have Rank with a weapon.  They may use Shields, but may not
wear armour.  They can attack with their hands in Close or Melee
Combat with a Base Chance of 40\% (+ 2\% per Binder's Rank) of doing +1
damage (+ 1 for every 3 points of PS above 15).  Golems made in
non-humanoid shapes may have more restrictions placed on their
abilities to use weapons, at the discretion of the GM.  Note that the
Natural Armour of a Stone Golem represents the difficulty in damaging
its rocky form.  The Natural Armour rating of the Golem is deducted
from all blows striking it, even those inflicting Endurance or
Specific Grievous Damage.

\item[Comments]
Stone Golems are basically mindless automatons, and can perform only
simple tasks.  Stone Golems remain inanimate after their construction
until Animation (G2) is cast over them.  They can remain inanimate
following their creation for any length of time without harmful
effect.  When the Duration of the activation expires the Golem becomes
a stone statue. It can be re-animated any number of times, until it is
destroyed by having its Endurance exhausted.

\subsection{Golem Accidents Table}
\label{binder:accidents}
{\small
\begin{description}
\item[Dice] \textbf{Effect}

\item[01--20]
Imperfection has no particular positive or negative effects, but may
result in a slight cosmetic change to the Golem.

\item[21--40]
The artisan creating the Golem is injured during the process, taking
D10 direct to Endurance.  If the artisan is an NPC, the GM should
determine whether or not they wish to continue with the ritual.

\item[41--50]
The Binder is injured during the process, taking D10 + 5 direct to
endurance.

\item[51--54]
Small Explosion!  Up to [D10 - 6] people in the workshop or work area
take D10 direct to Endurance, and the GM should determine the
willingness of NPCs to continue with the ritual.  The GM should also
determine whether or not the Golem is damaged or destroyed in the
blast.  20\% chance of a Flesh Golem being damaged, 10\% chance for a
Stone Golem, 1\% for an Iron Golem.  If the Golem is damaged, there is
half the original chance that it will be destroyed instead.  If it is
only damaged, additional ingredients to the value of 01--50\% of the
original cost will be required to fix it.

\item[55--56]
Large Explosion!  Everyone in the workshop or work area takes D10
direct to Endurance, and the workshop itself suffers severe damage.
Otherwise this result is similar to the ``Small Explosion'' above.

\item[57]
Huge Explosion!  Everyone in the workshop or work area takes D10 + 2
direct to Endurance, and the workshop is devastated.  The Golem is
destroyed (exceptions may be made for ``Iron'' Golems built of
Mithril), and the GM should consider the liberal use of pyrotechnics
justified.  Otherwise this result is similar to the ``Small
Explosion'' above.

\item[58--60]
There is only a D10 \x 10\% chance that the Golem will operate when
animated.  If 0 is rolled this result may effectively be ignored.
This percentage must be rolled each and every time the Golem is to be
activated.  If this result is rolled more than once, the effects are
cumulative.

\begin{example}
A Golem suffers this result.  The GM rolls an 8 on a D10, meaning that
the Golem has an 80\% chance of working each time it is activated,
that is animated.  Later in its creation, this Golem suffers this
result again and the GM rolls a 5 or 50\%.  50\% of 80 = 40\%.  The
Golem will operate only 40\% of the time.
\end{example}

\item[61--68]
One power or characteristic of the Golem only operates at D10 \x 10\%
of its expected efficiency.  If 0 is rolled this result may
effectively be ignored.  If this result is rolled more than once, the
effects are cumulative.  The GM should use their native cunning in
deciding what the exact effects are.

\item[69--79]
The Golem as a whole becomes flawed.  The Golem will still operate
but will become limited to approximately D10 \x 10\% of its expected
ability.  The lower the roll, the more severely flawed the Golem.
GM cunning and deviousness should be used here.

\item[80--86]
The Golem operates as intended, but requires D5 points of Fatigue to
animate it.  This roll should be made now, and the number of points
required will always be the same.  These points must be expended for
each and every activation.

\item[87--92]
Rogue!  The Golem will always be an uncontrolled rogue, whether the
Spell of Binding Golems is cast on it or not.  Do not roll to see if
the Golem is in a controlled state when it is animated, it won't be!

\item[93--97]
One power or characteristic of the Golem operates at double its
expected efficiency.  GM discretion must be used as to the exact
effects of this result.

\item[98--00]
The Binder has accidentally captured a minor extra-planar being in the
item (hellhound, imp, etc.). At the end of the creation ritual, the
Golem will automatically animate under the control of the trapped
entity, without the use of the Spell of Animation.  If the Golem is
destroyed the entity is released back to where it was captured from.
The Binder has no control over the Golem whilst it is animated by the
extra-planer being.

\end{description}}

Note that each time the GM rolls on this table, the Binder has a 20 (+
4\% / Rank of the Golem shaping ritual being attempted) chance of
detecting that something has gone wrong with the ritual.  If an
accident is noted, the Binder has a 5\% \x Rank chance of determining
the nature of the accident.  If this roll is 30 or more over their
determination chance, the GM should misinform the player as to the
nature of the accident.  If an accident is detected and the Binder
decides to start again from scratch, 40 (+ 3 / Rank) percent of the
original materials will be salvageable.

Some of the rituals of the College of Binding and Animating magics
require a far greater investment of time than the rituals of other
Colleges.  Some rituals will require weeks or even months.  It should
be noted that rituals extending for periods of 24 hours or more do not
require the intense concentration of the rituals of other Colleges.
The Adept is working and perhaps supervising the work of others, but
is not involved in constant concentration.  The Binder may eat, sleep
(8 hours a day) and perform other activities requiring less than 2
hours a day while engaged in a lengthy ritual.  During the period of
an extended ritual a Binder can utilise only stored magic, and that
inherent in the ritual.  Note that these restrictions may mean that a
Binder will lose practice in skills or weapons while performing an
extended ritual.  Binders may use 1 week during an extended ritual as
1 day of training time.  Magic cannot be trained during this time.  If
the Binder dies during an extended ritual, the ritual fails
completely.

\subsection{Objects and Possessions}

\subsubsection{Definition}

 The term ``Object'' is used throughout these rules to refer to an
item wholly composed of never living or formerly living matter, or
some combination thereof.

\subsubsection{Magic Resistance}

Objects do not normally have a Magic Resistance.  There are, however,
two cases in which they gain a Magic Resistance -- when they are
Possessions or Magical Animates.  In all cases, spells will still be
listed as, ``May only be passively resisted'', ``May not be
resisted'', etc.  This characteristic of a spell is only applicable if
the object is entitled to a Magic Resistance check, otherwise the
spell will not be resisted.

\subsubsection{Possessions}

Possessions are those objects held, carried or otherwise within the
personal area of an Entity.  They are affected by those spells that
affect the Entity, and are entitled to the Entity's Magic Resistance.

\subsubsection{Magical Animates}

Some Magical animates gain a magic resistance.  Only those animates
that are explicitly described as having a Magical Aptitude or
Willpower attribute gain a Magic Resistance.  Their Magic Resistance
is equal to their Willpower -- their MA is ``none''.  If their MA is 0
or greater, they may gain the +20\% bonus to their Magic Resistance if
they are not spellcasters.  Those animates that have neither MA nor
WP have no resistance to magic, and in addition, may be affected by
spells that affect Entities and by spells that affect objects, Thus,
for example, a magically animated chair might be affected by both a
Spell of Dragonflames that may only be used on Entities, and a Spell
of Igniting Flammables, that may only be used on objects.
