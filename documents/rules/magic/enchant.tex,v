@\begin{college}[1.1]{enchanter}{Ensorcelments and Enchantments}{EN}

This College is concerned with general magic, but especially with
charming and enchanting individuals and objects.  Practioners of
this college are often knows an Enchanters.

\subsection{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Ensorcelments and Enchantments may practice
their arts without restriction.

The MA requirement for this College is 16.

\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}

There are no modifiers to the Base Chance of performing any talent,
spell, or ritual of the College except as listed in magic modifiers or
under the descriptions of the specific spells, talents, and rituals of
the College.

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Wizardsight}

\multiple{150}
\basechance{Perception + 4\% / Rank}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may see objects or entities that are invisible --- they
appear to have a slight blue sheen around them. If the invisibility
effect (excluding Walking Unseen) is of a higher Rank than the
Wizardsight, the object or entity may not be clearly identified or
directly magically targeted.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Charming}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{500}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may influence the actions of any one entity by casting a
Spell of Charming over the individual. If the Generic True Name is
known, the Base Chance is increased by 15. If the Individual True Name
is known and used, the Base Chance is increased by 25.

The victim of the spell will then see the caster as their true friend
and will readily accept most suggestions emanating from them. Sworn
enemies of the caster (or of their race) will not be affected by this
spell unless the victim's Individual True Name is spoken and, even
then, the duration of the spell is halved.

The caster may either suggest actions to the victim or may order them
to act in a certain way on pain of losing the caster's ``friendship''.
Any suggestion that is not directly and obviously inimical to the
victim's interests (as defined by the GM, but usually limited to
actions that would be injurious or fatal to the victim) will be acted
upon 90\% of the time. The caster may only ensure 100\% compliance
with a request by making it an order based upon the friendship that
binds the victim and caster together. In such instances, however, the
victim immediately makes a Resistance Check. If they resist, then the
spell is broken. Otherwise, the victim will accept the order and be
100\% faithful to it for the remainder of the spell.

Whenever any suggestion is made that would lead to the victim's injury
or death, another Resistance Check is made. If the check is
unsuccessful, the victim will accept the suggestion, otherwise the
spell will be broken.

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Telekinesis}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity or object}
\begin{effects}
Allows the Adept to lift a target of weight up to 2 pounds and move it
at the rate of 2 TMR. For each Rank of the spell Adept may move an
additional 5 pounds or increase the speed by an additional 3 TMR.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Enchanted Sleep}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may send the target, provided it normally spends any time
sleeping, into a deep enchanted sleep which will last for the duration
of the spell or until the entity is awoken by another entity (by being
shaken, etc.). The target may not be wakened if the spell is Rank 10
or higher, but must continue to sleep until the spell wears off.  If a
General Knowledge counterspell of this college is cast upon an
affected target by any Adept then the spell will immediately dissipate
and the target can then be woken normally.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Walking Unseen}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not invisible.  This
means that it will not transmit light.  As a consequence the target
will cast a shadow (which may or may not be noticed depending on the
lighting etc --- even if noticed may not be connected to the target)
and have a reflection in a mirror (or any reflective surface).
However the target may not be noticed even if another entity is
looking directly at him/her. It should be noted that a crystal of
vision or similar would count as looking directly at the target, not
as a reflection.  An entity will get a perception check if the target
becomes invasive on that entity's senses (\eg standing in a frontal
adjacent hex, or standing behind the entity with the target's hands
over his/her eyes).  Although the target is not invisible, it may be
detected using any magical means for detecting invisible entities (\eg
witchsight).

If the target of the spell is touched by another entity, or that
entity's possessions, then the spell is broken.  The target of the
spell may not break it voluntarily (other than by, for example,
touching another entity). Once broken the spell must be recast.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Speaking to Enchanted Creatures}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell gives the Adept the ability to speak and understand the
language of all magical creatures.  One casting will allow
communication with any fantastical creature, but will not allow the
Adept to comprehend fantastical creatures talking amongst themselves
or to other people affected by this spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Location}

\range{10 miles + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may determine the direction in which they will find any
person or object of their desire which they have previously
encountered or studied and which is within range.  The direction will
be indicated by a large glowing arrow, only visible to the Adept. The
arrow will not appear if the target is not within range.  If cast, and
the target is not within range, then the spell is dissipated. The
arrow will not appear should the target come within range during the
period the spell would normally have been in effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Mass Charming}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{850}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Charms 1 entity per Rank as long as the Adept maintains their
concentration. The spell takes 3 minutes to take effect and the
effects linger 3 to 5 minutes after concentration is broken.

The effects of the spell on the individuals are identical to the
effects of Spell of Charming [G-1].

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-8]{Invisibility}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{45\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion, Ward}
\target{Entity or object}
\begin{effects}

The target of this spell becomes invisible and may not be seen by
non-magical means. An invisible thing does not have a shadow or a
reflection. They have no impact on their environment as a result of
the effects of light in any form. The converse is not true - light
still affects the target (\eg may still see, be hit by Blackfire
etc.). Invisibility may be cast over objects or entities (and any
possessions of either). An object's possessions are any thing which is
totally enclosed by that object (\eg coins in an invisible chest which
is closed, but not one which is open).  If a thing ceases to be a
possession, then the spell will not affect it. Similarly if an object
becomes a possession then the spell will affect it (\ie an object put
down by an invisible entity will become seen; a coin put in the
invisible chest will become invisible). Note that light may not be a
possession --- if the target is carrying a lantern it will be invisible,
but the light it emits will not.

The spell ceases to work whenever the target makes a strike check
(whether resulting in a ``hit'' or not) that does not involve a Thrown
or Missile weapon (used as such). This restriction does not apply to
Invisibility when cast at rank 16 or higher. The target may always
choose to end the spell at any time.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9]{Evil Eye}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 day + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}

Any target who fails to resist has their Strike Chance and Magic
Resistance reduced by 1 per Rank (minimum of 1).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Greater Enchantment}

\duration{Ranks 0--10 a fortnight ; Ranks 11--19 3 months ; Rank 20 permanent until dispelled}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{80\% + 1\% / Rank}
\target{Entity (not self)}
\casttime{1 hour}
\material{1 ounce of black myrrh (+ 1 / Rank)}
\materialcost{500 sp (+ 500 / Rank)}
\begin{effects}
The ritual takes 1 hour and requires that the Adept first draw a
Pentacle within which both they and the subject of the ritual must
remain during the entire ritual.  The Adept must burn the black myrrh
during the ritual.  The target of this ritual will be either blessed
or cursed (Adept's choice) with an increase or decrease in the
target's Base Chance of doing anything or suffering any good or ill
fortune by plus or minus 1 + 1 / Rank. All Strike Chances, Resistance
Checks, etc.\ directly affecting the target will continue to be
altered in this manner until the effects of the ritual wear off. If
the ritual is used to curse, the curse is minor.  This ritual cannot
be performed on self.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-2]{Creating Crystal of Vision}

\multiple{200}
\basechance{75\% + 1\% / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can create a crystal that acts as a viewing crystal.  They
perform the ritual over an available piece of crystal (the bigger the
crystal, the better the image will ultimately be) in their possession.
The Adept must burn 1 ounce of ambergris during the ritual at a cost
of 1,000 Silver Pennies. The resulting crystal may be used once per
day for 10 minutes + 1 minute per Rank (GMs should carefully time
consultations).

They may then view visions (usually precognitive in nature) concocted
by the GM. At Rank 6 and above, they may use the crystal to spy into
an area to see what is going on there. The maximum distance from the
character to the area being spied into is 5 miles (+ 15 / Rank). To do
so, the Adept must remain in the same place and take no other action.

If a crystal ball is used to look at a location then the ball will
only look at the location specified. It can not then be commanded to
move around. It will enable the observation of events in that location
for its duration and will then clear. Once started it will continue to
look at that location for its entire duration.  If the user cannot
form a clear mental image for the ball to focus on, or command it to
focus on an unambiguously defined point in space, then it is the GM's
discretion as to what the ball will show.  These are mystical devices,
not telescopes or x-ray machines.  It is not possible to use detection
talents (such as Detect Aura) through a crystal of vision.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-3]{Creating Sleep Dust}

\multiple{250}
\basechance{80\% + 1\% / Rank}
\casttime{3 hours}
\begin{effects}
The Adept must spend 3 hours preparing and implementing this ritual
and must expend 10,000 Silver Pennies (- 500 / Rank) to purchase the
necessary ingredients prior to making the attempt. If the attempt
fails, the ingredients are ruined and may not be reused or resold. If
the ritual succeeds, one ounce (a single dose) of sleep dust results.

When thrown in the face of one target it has the effect of an instant
Spell of Enchanted Sleep of the same Rank as the sleep dust. The sleep
dust will only remain fresh for three weeks after manufacture.

The effects of sleep dust can be passively resisted by the victim, but
with a reduction of 20 to their Magic Resistance.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-4]{Manufacturing Poison Dust}

\multiple{250}
\basechance{80\% + 1\% / Rank}
\casttime{3 hours}
\begin{effects}
This ritual works in the same manner as Q-3 and employs the same
numbers for all purposes. However, instead of causing the victim to
fall asleep, it inflicts [D - 5] + 1 for every 2 (or fraction) ranks
damage due to poisoning, on individuals who fail to resist.  Like
sleep dust, poison dust must be thrown in the face of the target.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}


\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Ventriloquism}

\range{90 feet}
\duration{5 minutes + 3 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{60\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The spell allows the Adept to project their voice and alter it so that
it sounds like any other voice the Adept has heard. The voice may be
projected so that it appears to be emanating from anywhere within the
radius of the spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Bolt of Energy}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{50\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity or object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cast a bolt of energy at a target and will, as a result,
inflict [D - 5] (+ 1 per Rank) damage on the first entity or object
that the bolt encounters.

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Opening}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Ranks}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
Instantly opens any one object or portal, including those locked by
Mage Lock (S-6).  A door or lid will have all locks unlocked and bolts
undone and will become immediately open (ajar).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Enchant Weapon}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
Increases the Base Chance to hit with the weapon over which it is cast
by 1 (+ 1 / Rank) and increases the damage done by the weapon by 1 for
every 3 (or fraction) Ranks.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Web of Entanglement}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: maximum 15 minutes + 15 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity or object}
\begin{effects}
This spell allows the Adept to project a sticky web, similar to a
spider web in construction, from their fingertips at a target hex,
object or entity. Any objects or entities standing between the Adept
and the target are ensnared by the web along with the target. The web
may only ensnare a number of human-sized entities equal to the
Adepts's rank and so will stop at the hex at which this limit is
reached (or maximum range).

The web continues until cut or until the Adept ceases to concentrate
on it. In order to cut the web, a character must successfully strike
with a weapon that does type B damage and must inflict at least 10
points of damage as a result of that single strike.  The web has no
defence.

Any ensnared entity must roll 1 \x PS (2 \x PS if they successfully
resisted) in order to move themselves to an adjacent hex (which may be
free of the web), or to perform an action within the web. A similar
check is required for any entity attempting to remove an object from
the web. If an entity receives aid in removing themselves from the
web, the PS of the aiding character may be combined with their
own. Any dropped object will become ensnared by the web, as will any
entity who comes into contact with it (up to the limit of the web).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Mage Lock}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The spell may be cast over any portal (door, window, etc.) that
can normally be opened or closed. It effectively locks the portal
with an unpickable lock. The portal may still be forced open by
brute strength. The Physical Strength(s) of all characters attempting
to force a portal locked in this manner are added together and
multiplied by the Difficulty Factor of the task. The Difficulty
Factor is a function of the Rank of the spell:

\begin{tabular}{cl}
{\bf Rank}	& {\bf Difficulty Factor} \\
1--5		& 3 \\
6--10		& 2 \\
11--20		& 1.5 \\
\end{tabular}

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Enhancing Enchantment}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Rank of this spell is added to the Rank of one characteristic of
any spell being cast within the area of effect. Note that the actual
Rank of the affected spell is unchanged --- only the effect of one
characteristic is enhanced (as per double and triple effects).

While casting the Spell of Enhancing Enchantment, the adept specifies
the spell characteristic to be affected. Only Range, Duration, Base
Chance, or (where appropriate) Damage, may be affected by this spell.

A spell may never have a characteristic enhanced by Ranks greater than
its own rank by the use of this spell (\eg a Rank 6 spell that is
cast within a Rank 8 Spell of Enhancing Enchantment will only gain the
effects of 6 extra ranks in the affected characteristic).

Only spells that are cast are affected, not spells being released from
any form of storage. The caster of the subject spell will be aware
that their spell is being affected by enhancement during the pulse
that they are preparing (as per high or low Mana). They will not know
which characteristic is being affected nor the amount of
enhancement. They may not restrict the effect of the enhancement, but
may reduce the spell effects in the normal manner. If an attempt is
made to cast a Spell of Enhancing Enchantment on an area that has some
part of it under the effects of another Spell of Enhancing
Enchantment, then the second spell will fail.

Special Duration, Range, or Damage effects may be caused by the use of
this spell (\eg Duration of Lesser Enchantment at Rank 20).

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Levitation}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes \x [D - 5] \x [Rank]}
\multiple{125}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
Causes the target of the spell to rise into the air 15 feet (+ 1 /
Rank) at the rate of 1 foot / pulse. The spell is limited to vertical
movement and will in no way propel the target horizontally.

\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Enchant Armour}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Ward, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
This spell adds 2 (+ 2 / Rank) to the target's defense versus physical
weapons.  At Rank 11 and above it also permits the target's armour to
absorb 1 additional point of damage. The target must be armoured.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Wizard's Eye}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{1 minute + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates an invisible, intangible eye which they can move
around within a radius equal to the spell's range. The eye originates
in the same spot as the Adept and operates as would any normal eye
except that it is not attached to the Adept physically.  Wizard's Eyes
have a TMR of 10.

The eye can move through solid objects but will see only blackness
while within an object.  The eye can be seen with witchsight or other
means of detecting invisible objects.  It is possible to use the eye
to target spells, but the range is determined from the Adept, not from
the eye.  The eye (and hence the Adept) is susceptible to magical
effects if the effect can affect eyes (\eg Flash of Light,
blindness).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Slowness}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds \x [D - 5] \x [Rank]}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Potion, Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell affects 1 (+ 1 / 2, or fraction, Rank) targets.  All
entities subject to this spell have their running, crawling, flying,
or swimming speed halved and have the time it takes them to do
anything on the Tactical Display doubled (\eg they could only attack
once every two pulses).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-12]{Quickness}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds \x [D - 5] \x [Rank]}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Potion, Investment, Ward}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The spell affects 1 (+ 1 / 3, or fraction, Ranks) targets.  The
targets' Initiative Value is increased by 10, and they can perform
Actions twice as often.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

of the spell or until the entity is wakened by another entity (by
being shaken, etc.). The target may not be wakened if the spell is
Rank 10 or higher, but must continue to sleep until the spell wears
off.  If a General Knowledge counterspell of this college is cast
upon an affected target by any Adept then the spell will immediate
dissipate and the target can then be woken normally.

pounds or move the chosen target at an additional 2 miles an hour per
Rank.

The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not invisible. If the
target of the spell, or the target's possessions, are touched by
another entity, or that entity's possessions, then the spell is
dissipated. An entity's possessions are those non-entity things which
the entity is wearing or carrying at that time. An unconscious or
sleeping entity is not a possession, it is still an entity.  The
target of the spell may not break it voluntarily (other than by, for
example, touching another entity). Once broken the spell must be
recast.

The target of the spell is not invisible. This means that it will not
transmit light. As a consequence the target will cast a shadow (which
may or may not be noticed depending on the lighting etc., --- even if
noticed may not be connected to the target) and have a reflection in a
mirror (or any reflective surface). However the target may not be
noticed even if another entity is looking directly at them. It should
be noted that a crystal of vision or similar would count as looking
directly at the target, not as a reflection. An entity will get a
perception check if the target becomes invasive on that entity's
senses (\eg standing in a frontal adjacent hex, or standing behind
the entity with the target's hands over their eyes). Although the
target is not invisible, it may be detected using any magical means
for detecting invisible entities (\eg witchsight).

The Adept may determine the direction in which he will find any person
or object of their desire which they have previously encountered or
studied and which is within range.  The direction will be indicated by
a large glowing arrow, only visible to the Adept. The arrow will not
appear if the target is not within range.  If cast, and the target is
not within range, then the spell is dissipated. Hence the arrow will
not appear should the target come within range during the period the
spell would normally have been in effect.

Possessions of either). An object's possessions are any thing which is
totally enclosed by that object (\eg coins in an invisible chest
which is closed, but not one which is open).  An entity's possessions
are any non-entity thing carried by the entity at the time. An
unconscious or sleeping entity may not be a possession, it is still an
entity. If a thing ceases to be a possession, then the spell will not
affect it. Similarly if an object becomes a possession then the spell
will affect it (\ie an object put down by an invisible entity will
become seen; a coin put in the invisible chest will become
invisible). It should be noted that light may not be a possession - if
the target is carrying a lantern it will be invisible, but the light
it emits will not.

remain during the entire ritual.  It requires that the Adept burn the
black myrrh during the ritual.  The target of this ritual will be
either blessed or cursed (caster's choice) with an increase or
decrease in the target's Base Chance of doing anything or suffering
any good or ill fortune by plus or minus 1 + 1 / Rank. All Strike
Chances, Resistance Checks, etc.\ directly affecting the target will
continue to be altered in this manner until the effects of the ritual
wear off. If the ritual is used to curse, the curse is minor.  This
ritual cannot be performed on self.

The Adept can create a crystal that acts as a viewing crystal.  He
performs the ritual over an available piece of crystal (the bigger the
crystal, the better the image will ultimately be) in his
possession. The Adept must burn 1 ounce of ambergris during the ritual
at a cost of 1,000 Silver Pennies. The resulting crystal may be used
once per day for 10 minutes + 1 minute per Rank (GMs should carefully
time consultations).

This spell allows the Adept to project a sticky web from their
fingertips.

The caster projects a web, similar to a spider web in construction,
from their fingertips at a target hex, object or entity. Any objects
or entities standing between the caster and the target are ensnared by
the web along with the target. The web may only ensnare a number of
human-sized entities equal to the caster's rank and so will stop at
the hex at which this limit is reached (or maximum range).

The Adept may enchant any entity of his choice who is in his physical
presence during the ritual. The Adept may not enchant himself.  The
ritual takes 1 hour and requires that the Adept first draw a Pentacle
within which both he and the subject of the ritual must remain during
the entire ritual. The Adept may perform no other actions while
implementing this ritual. The Base Chance of the ritual being
successful is 80 plus 1 per Rank. The effects last a fortnight at
Ranks 0 through 10, 3 months at Ranks 11 through 19, and until
dispelled at Rank 20. It requires that the Adept burn 1 ounce of black

Any ensnared entity must roll 1 Physical Strength ( 2 if they
successfully resisted) in order to move themselves to an adjacent hex

web. A similar check is required for any entity attempting to remove
an object from the web. If an entity receives aid in removing
themselves from the web, the PS of the aiding character may be
combined with their own. Any dropped object will become ensnared by

they are preparing (as per high or low Mana). They will not know which
characteristic is being affected nor the amount of enhancement. They
may not restrict the effect of the enhancement, but may reduce the
spell effects in the normal manner. If an attempt is made to cast a

{\em Effects:} The effects of this spell are identical to those for
the spell of that name (S-1) of the College of Naming Incantations (\S
\ref{namer:charm}) except that the target's Generic True Name need not
be known to cast the spell.  If the Generic True Name is known, the
Base Chance is increased by 15\%.  If the Individual True Name is
known and used, the Base Chance is increased by 25\%.

\textbf{Description from Namer:} {\emph
The Namer may influence theactions of any one entity

suggestion is made that would lead to the victim's injury or death,
another Resistance Check is made.  If the check is unsuccessful, the
victim will accept the suggestion, otherwise the spell will be broken.}

\end{spelldesc}
{\em Effects:} The target of this spell may move unnoticed, not
invisible.  If the target of the spell, or the target's possessions,
are touched by another entity, or that entity's possessions, then the
spell is broken.  An entity's possessions are those non-entity things
which the entity is wearing or carrying at that time.  An unconscious
or sleeping entity is not a possession, it is still an entity. The
target of the spell may not break it voluntarily (other than by, for
example, touching another entity). Once broken the spell most be
recast.

The target of the spell is not invisible.  This means that it will not
transmit light.  As a consequence the target will cast a shadow (which
may or may not be noticed depending on the lighting etc - even if

{\em Effects:} The Adept may determine the direction in which he will
find any person or object of his desire which he has previously
encountered or studied and which is within range.  The direction will
be indicated by a large glowing arrow, only visible to the caster.
The arrow will not appear if the target is not within range.  If cast,
and the target is not within range, then the mana is dissipated.  Hence
the arrow will not appear should the target come within range during
the period the spell would normally have been in effect.

their concentration.  The spell takes 3 minutes to take effect and the
effects linger 3 to 5 minutes after concentration is broken.  The
effects are identical to S-1 of the College of Naming Incantations.

\textbf{Taken from the Namer College:} 
The Namer may influence the actions of any one entity
whose Generic Name he knows by casting a Spell of Charming over the
individual.  If, in addition, the Namer knows and pronounces the
victim's Individual True Name, the Base Chance of the spell taking
effect is increased by 50 and the effect of the spell is increased.

The caster may either suggest actions to the victim or may order him
to act in a certain way on pain of losing the caster's ``friendship''.
Any suggestion that is not directly and obviously inimical to the
victim's interests (as defined by the GM, but usually limited to
actions that would be injurious or fatal to the victim) will be acted
upon 90\% of the time.  The caster may only ensure 100\% compliance
with a request by making it an order based upon the friendship that
binds the victim and caster together.  In such instances, however, the
victim immediately makes a Resistance Check.  If he resists, then the
spell is broken.  Otherwise, the victim will accept the order and be
100\% faithful to it for the remainder of the spell.  Whenever any
suggestion is made that would lead to the victim's injury or death,
another Resistance Check is made.  If the check is unsuccessful, the
victim will accept the suggestion, otherwise the spell will be broken.

{\em Effects:} The target of this spell becomes invisible and may not be
seen by non-magical means.  An invisible thing does not have a shadow
or a reflection.  They have no impact on their environment as a result
of the effects of light in any form.  The converse is not true -
light still affects the target (e.g. may still see, be hit by Blackfire etc).

Invisibility may be cast over objects or entities (and any
Possessions of either).  An object's possessions are any thing which
is totally enclosed by that object (e.g.  coins in an invisible chest
Which is closed, but not one which is open).  An entity's possessions
are any non-entity thing carried by the entity at the time.  An

entity.  If a thing ceases to be a possession, then the spell will not
affect it.  Similarly if an object becomes a possession then the spcll

become seen; a coin put in the invisible chest will become invisible).
It should be noted that light may not be a possession - if the target
is carrying a lantern it will be invisible, but the light it emits
will not.

this manner until the effects of the ritual wear off.  If the ritual

The Adept can create a crystal that acts in the same manner as a
Waters of Vision Spell (S-8) of the College of Water Magics.  To do
so, the Adept must remain in the same place and take no other action.
He performs the ritual over an available piece of crystal (the bigger
the crystal, the better the image will ultimately be) in his
possession.  The Adept must burn 1 ounce of ambergris during the
ritual at a cost of 1,000 Silver Pennies.  The resulting crystal may
be used once per day for 10 minutes + 1 minute per Rank (GM's should
carefully time consultations) in the same manner as the Waters of
Vision.

\textbf{From Game Masters Guide:} If a crystall basll is used to look
at a location then the ball will only look at the location specified.
It can not then be commanded to move around.  It will enable the
observation of events in that location for its duration and will then
clear.  Once started it will continue to look at that location for its
entire duration.  If the user cannot form a clear mental image for the
ball to focus on, or command it to focus on an unambiguously definded
point in space, then its the GM's discretion as to what the ball will
show.  These are mystical devices, not telescopes or x-ray machines.

{\em Effects: }This spell wiorks similarly to the Web of Fire Spell
(S-4) in the College of Fire Magics except that it allows the Adept to
project a sticky web instead of a web of fire from their fingertips.
Any objects or individuals immediately between the caster and the
target of the spell (along the flight path of the web) will be struck
by the web and ensnared.  The web can ensnare a number of human-sized
targets equal to the Rank of the spell.  Ensnared characters may not
move, and can only take actions in every other pulse.  In order to
free themself from the web, each ensnared character must roll under or
equal to Physical Strength or cut successfully cut the web.  The web
is cut whenever any Strike against it with a weapon that is rated for
type B damage results in 10 or more Damage Points to the web.  Once
any character cuts the web, all characters cease to be ensnared by it.

{\em Effects:} The spell may be cast over any portal (door, window,
etc.) that can normally be opened or closed.  It effectively locks the
portal with an unpickable lock.  The portal may still be forced open
by brute strength.  The Physical Strength(s) of all characters
attempting to force a portal locked in this manner are added together
and multiplied by the Difficulty Factor of the task.  The Difficulty
Factor is always a function of the Rank of the spell:

any spell being cast within the area of effect.  Note that the actual
Rank of the affected spell is unChanced - only the effects of one
characteristic is enhanced (as per double and triple effects). While
casting the Spell of Enhancing Enchantment, the adept specifies the
spell characteristic to be affected.  Only Range, Duration, Base
Chance, or (Ivllere appropriate) Damage, may be affected by this
sl)ell.  A spell may never have a characteristic enhanced by Ranks
greater than its own Rank by the use of this spell (Eg a Rank 6 spell
that is cast within a Rank 8 Spell of Enhancing Enchantment will only
gain the effects of 6 extra ranks in the affected characteristic).

any form of storage.  The caster of the subject spell will be aware
that their spell is being affected by an effect of enhancing during
the pulse that they are casting (as per high or low mana).  They will
not know which characteristic is being affected nor the amount of
enhancement.  They may not restrict the effect of the enhancenient,
but niay reduce the spell effects in the normal manner.  If an attempt
is niade to cast a Spell of Enhancing Enchantment on an area that has
sonie part of it under the effects of another Spell of Enhancing
Enchantment, then the area of effect of second spell will not conie
into being.  If Base Chance is enhanced, 3\% per Rank is added to the
Base Chance.  Special Duration, Range, or Damage effects may be caused
by the use of this spell (eg. Duration of Lesser Enchantment (Earth
G-8) at Rank 20).
