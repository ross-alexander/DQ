@\begin{college}[1.0]{summoner}{Greater Summonings}{GS}

\textbf{This is a non-player college only.  Player Characters may not
learn it, transfer to it, or learn any of the spells or rituals with
the exception of the counterspells.}

The College of Greater Summonings is concerned exclusively with the
summoning and controlling of entities from other dimensions.  All such
summonings and associated magical procedures are Ritual Magic.
Members of the College of Greater Summonings possess no Talent or
Spell Magic as a result of their association with the College.  Their
power lies exclusively in their ability to summon and control beings
via the performance of special rituals.

All summonings of this College, regardless of the type of being they
are designed to summon, are performed in the same manner.  First the
summoner must perform a Ritual Cleansing of their body (requiring from
1 to 10 hours).  Then they must prepare and implement the proper
Ritual of Summoning.  The Ritual of Summoning itself requires only one
hour to execute.  Once the Adept has performed the Ritual of
Summoning, they may wish to control the entity they have summoned by
implementing either a Ritual of Binding or a Ritual of True Speaking.
Binding and True Speaking Rituals each require one hour to prepare and
implement.  If the summoner does not implement these rituals
immediately upon successfully summoning the entity who is the target,
they will have to engage in a new Ritual of Cleansing before
attempting to enact another ritual.

When performing the summoning rituals of this College, the summoner
occupies a Circle of Protection which also contains within it a
Pentacle of Power.  Unless the summoner and companions occupy this
protective area, there is a chance that whatever they summon will be
able to turn on them and destroy them.  Only the summoner occupies the
Pentacle.  Their companions occupy the Circle, but are outside the
Pentacle.

The summoned entity appears in the vicinity of the Circle of
Protection, but outside it (unless the ritual backfires and the Circle
is broken).  In order to perform (and as part of the performance of)
the Rituals of True Speaking and Binding, the summoned entity is
forced into the Triangle (outside the Circle of Protection).

The Pentacle, Circle of Protection, and Triangle must all be drawn on
the ground by the summoner before the rituals are performed.

\subsection{Restrictions}

\textbf{Members of the College of Greater Summonings must meet
requirements of time, place, equipment, knowledge, and circumstance in
order to perform their College's magic.}

The following list of requirements must be met in all or most
situations wherein the arts of the College of Greater Summonings are
practised:

\begin{Enumerate}
\item
The Adept must know the spell or ritual being employed.

\item
If a summoning of an entity other than an Incubus or Succubus is being
performed, the Adept must know the name of the entity being summoned
and speak it during the ritual.

\item
Throughout all preparations for the ritual and throughout the ritual
itself, the Adept must remain stationary.  They may engage in no other
activity.

\item
The space used for the performance of the ritual must be large enough
to accommodate the ritual symbols and the entity being summoned
(usually, an area 30' \x 30' and 12' high is adequate) and may not have
been affected by an area counterspell in the last 12 hours.

\item
If the magic is a Special Knowledge Ritual, it may only be performed
on certain days of the month and at certain hours of the day (listed
in \S\ref{greater.summonings:special.rituals}).

\item
The Adept must possess the necessary tools and equipment to perform
any ritual and must have access to such substances as clear water for
the cleansing which precedes each ritual.
\end{Enumerate}

If the Adept fails to meet any of these requirements, they may not
attempt to perform any ritual of the College of Greater Summoning.
They may still exercise any special Talent Magic they may possess and
may cast counterspells.

The MA requirement for this College is 9.

\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}

The following numbers are added to the Base Chance of successfully
performing a ritual of the College of Greater Summoning:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Each Rank the Adept has achieved with the ritual & 3 \\
Adept occupies a Mana-rich place & 15 \\
Each hour (maximum of 10) Adept spends in Ritual Cleansing prior to
performing the ritual & 3 \\
Ritual is part of the College's body of General Knowledge and is begun
at midnight & 20 \\
Ritual is part of the College's body of General Knowledge and is
performed while the moon Luna is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 14 days into its
cycle. & 20 \\
\end{tabularx}

These modifications apply only to rituals.  Counterspells are affected
in the same manner so far as Mana and Rank are concerned.  They are
also affected by the provisions of \S\ref{magic:modifiers}.  They are
unaffected by other modifications.

Special Knowledge Rituals are affected differently from General
Knowledge Rituals so far as the hour of the day or day of the moon in
which they are performed is concerned.  The effects of the hour and
day on these rituals is discussed in
\S\ref{greater.summonings:special.rituals}.

\subsection{Talents}

There are no Talent Magics granted an Adept simply because they are a
member of this College.  However, there is a possibility that the
Adept may be assigned a ``companion'' by a demon they have summoned.
Once an Adept has been assigned a companion, they may automatically
call forth (and later dismiss) that companion.  Once called forth, the
companion instantly appears to do the bidding of the Adept.  In this
sense, there is some Talent Magic available to members of this
College.

Upon dismissing a demon they have summoned, the summoner may request
that the demon assign them a companion from among its legions of
lesser spirits.  The Base Chance that a demon will grant this request
is listed under the ``Lesser Spirits'' heading for each demon.  The
summoner rolls D100, and if the resulting number is less than or equal
to the Base Chance, the demon grants a companion.  If the number is
half or less than the Base Chance, the demon grants two companions.

A companion will be either a lesser Devil or an imp who is constantly
``on call'' to the summoner.  The companion is available until one of
the following events occurs:

\begin{Enumerate}
\item
The summoner requests a companion from any other Demon except the
Demon who granted the summoner's current companion (regardless of
whether or not the request is granted).

\item
The companion is dispelled by having a General Knowledge Counterspell
of the College of Greater Summonings cast over it by the summoner.

\item
The companion is forced into its own dimension by a reduction in its
Endurance sufficient to cause unconsciousness.

\item
The summoner voluntarily attacks the companion or quits the College of
Greater Summonings.
\end{Enumerate}

When a companion is granted, the summoner rolls D10.  If the result is
1--4, their companion will be an imp.  If it is 5--10, it will be a
devil.  A separate roll is made for each companion if more than one is
granted.

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

The College of Greater Summonings General Knowledge and Special
Knowledge Counterspells are the only spells usable by members of this
College.  See \S\ref{magic:counterspells} for descriptions of the
nature and working of counterspells.

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}

There are six rituals that an Adept learns upon becoming a member of
this College.  The first is the Ritual of Cleansing in which the Adept
bathes their body and meditates as a prelude to attempting any other
ritual.  It is not possible to attempt any other ritual of this
College unless one has first engaged in the Ritual of Cleansing.
There are three summoning rituals that are part of the body of General
Knowledge of this College.  They are the Ritual of Summoning Succubi,
the Ritual of Summoning Incubi, and the Ritual of Summoning Heroes.
There are two non-summoning rituals associated with the General
Knowledge of this College besides the Ritual of Cleansing.  They are
the Ritual of Binding and the Ritual of True Speaking.  These two
rituals may only be employed after a summoning ritual has been
successfully completed.  They are sometimes necessary to gain the
required services of beings from other dimensions.

Also as part of the study of the General Knowledge of this College,
the Adept receives a parcel containing the tools necessary to their
magic.  The parcel consists of the following:

\begin{inset}{\small}{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{X@@{\hspace{0.5em}}c@@{\hspace{0.5em}}c}
\textbf{Item} & \textbf{Weight} & \textbf{Value} \\
1 sceptre of dogwood		& 1 lb &  250sp \\
1 broadsword of silvered steel	& 6 lb &  150sp \\
1 mitre				& 1 lb &  50sp \\
1 cap				& 5 lb &  10sp \\
1 robe of virgin linen		& 3 lb &  20sp \\
1 girdle of lion's  skin imprinted with symbols & 3 lb & 100sp \\
1 censor of silver and gems	& 2 lb	&  3000sp \\
\end{tabularx}
\end{inset}

In addition to these tools, the Adept is provided with a supply of
materials which together weigh 5 pounds and which must be replenished
on the average of every three months at a cost of 1000 Silver Pennies.
These items include: A packet of charcoal, a packet of powdered
agrimony (for making tea used in the Ritual of Cleansing), a 3 ounce
tin of myrrh, a vial of white frankincense dissolved in white wine, a
6 ounce pot of sandlewood and powdered antimony, a 2 ounce tin of
ambergris salve, an 8 ounce box of multi-coloured chalks (for drawing
the Triangle, Circle, Hexagram and Pentagram necessary for the various
Rituals of Summoning).

The Adept is also taught the Generic True Names of all things that
occupy dimensions other than their own and may be summoned to this
dimension.  They also learn the Individual True Names of all heroes of
other dimensions known to the College and of the 72 great Demons of
the Seventh Plane.  The Adept does not learn the rituals necessary to
summon Demons from the Seventh Plane --- only the names of the Demons
and how to identify them.  A member of this College may learn
additional Individual True Names of entities from other planes by
first acquiring them from a Demon and then studying the True Names in
the same manner as a member of the College of Naming Incantations.

The following Rituals constitute the major part of the knowledge the
Adept acquires in their general training.

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Cleansing}

\begin{effects}
The Ritual of Cleansing must be performed prior to any other rituals
of this College.  The Adept cleans their body and purifies their mind
for from 1 to 10 hours.  The Base Chance of any succeeding Ritual
being successful is increased by 3 for each hour spent in Ritual
Cleansing.  There is no Base Chance for this ritual being successful.
The Adept states the number of hours they will expend on the ritual
and at the end of that period of time, the Adept is cleansed.  They
may perform no other activity while engaged in this ritual.  If their
concentration is broken, they must restart the cleansing from the
beginning or abandon the effort.  Any rituals the Adept desires to
perform after the cleansing must be performed immediately.  They may
perform any number of rituals within three hours of the cleansing, but
these rituals must immediately follow each other.  Any time spent in
any other activity destroys the effects of the cleansing and a new
cleansing must be accomplished before another ritual can be enacted.

\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-2]{Summoning Succubi}

\multiple{300}
\basechance{5\% + 3 / Rank}
\begin{effects}
This ritual may be used to summon one or more Succubi, who will arrive
on this plane favourably disposed towards the summoner for having
summoned them, and thus will not immediately need to be bound.
Succubi arrive on this plane with only one goal: the enticement and
mating with humans.  Any deed the summoner desires of them which will
further their goal will be approved and encouraged by the Succubi.  If
the Succubi are summoned to perform a task not immediately related to
their goal, they will have to be Bound and forced to do the task.  The
Base Chance is 5\% (+ 3 / Rank), and it is reduced by 10 for each
Succubi above one being summoned at once.  If the ritual backfires,
the Succubi will appear and attempt to molest and then devour the
summoner and his or her companions.

Succubi remain on this plane and serve for a number of days equal to
[D + 4].  The die is rolled individually for each Succubus
successfully summoned.  The Succubi may also be forcibly returned to
their own plane whenever their Endurance is reduced to the point that
they are reduced to unconsciousness or a counterspell is cast over
them by their summoner.  Once returned to their own plane, they may
not return to the aid of the summoner unless the summoner performs
another Ritual of Summoning Succubi.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-3]{Summoning Incubi}

\multiple{300}
\basechance{5\% + 3 / Rank}
\begin{effects}
This ritual operates in the same manner of Q-2 (the Ritual of
Summoning Succubi).

Incubi are exactly like Succubi, except that they appear only in the
male form, rather than as females.  They will tend to be 2--3 points
stronger and will have 1--2 points less Endurance than Succubi, but
will other wise be the same.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-4]{Summoning Heroes}

\multiple{500}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may summon a great hero from another dimension to assist
them.  This hero may be any character from the body of fantasy
literature known to both the Adept and the GM.  The GM always sets the
characteristics of the hero, their weaponry and armour, the number and
type of companions (if any) and the length of time and terms under
which they will remain in the Adept's dimension and assist them.  The
GM may limit the use of this ritual to periods when various celestial
bodies are in conjunction (once a game year or so).  The GM need not
inform the Adept of any details concerning the results of the
summoning until it has been performed.

The Base Chance that this ritual will succeed will vary according to
the hero the Adept is attempting to summon, but should usually be set
at less than 20\%.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-5]{True Speaking}

\multiple{250}
\basechance{50\%}
\begin{effects}
Whenever any entity except a hero is summoned, the summoner may wish
to ask them questions. In all cases, the truthfulness of the entity
summoned (Incubus, Succubus, Demon) will be less than 100\%.
Sometimes it will be very near 100\%, but in the case of a Demon who
is particularly resentful that they have been summoned (or one that is
an habitual liar) the chance of the entity telling the truth may be as
low as 5\%. The only way to be sure that the entity will tell the
truth is to perform a Ritual of True Speaking and then ask the entity
for answers to the desired questions during the ritual.  The entity is
required to stand within a triangle and give answers to the summoner's
questions during the ritual.  The ritual lasts for one full hour, and
the summoner may do nothing else during the time the ritual is in
progress except ask questions. The effects of the ritual do not extend
beyond the end of the ritual.  The Base Chance of forcing the entity
into the triangle and successfully performing the ritual is 50\%.  The
GM rolls D100 to determine the success of the ritual.  They need not
inform players of the result of the dice roll. The entity may
passively resist the effects of the ritual.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-6]{Binding}

\multiple{400}
\begin{effects}
An Adept may perform a Ritual of Binding in order to bind an entity
(other than a hero) to this plane.  They cannot normally control a
Demon that is not bound, except while inside the Pentacle they
occupied when they summoned the demon.  Before they can leave the
Pentacle or require any service of the demon except for conversation
and teaching of skills, the summoner must in most cases perform a
Ritual of Binding.  The Base Chance of successfully binding a
particular demon is equal to half (rounded down) the unmodified Base
Chance to summon that demon initially.  The Demon can actively resist
the workings of a Ritual of Binding.

Once bound, a demon will remain on this plane for a number of days
equal to [D - 3] and will serve the summoner more or less willingly
during that time.  In some cases, special conditions must be met to
bind the demon.  Usually, this means the giving of presents, most
often human life.  If the demon resists such an offering, it will have
also broken the summoning and may turn on the summoner despite the
fact that the summoner is protected by the Pentacle.  When this
happens, the summoner rolls D100. If the result is less than or equal
to the summoner's Magic Resistance, the demon is banished to its own
plane.  If the result is greater than the summoner's Magical
Resistance, the summoner is overcome by the will of the demon and
voluntarily breaks the circle of protection allowing the demon to
enter the pentacle and attack them.

Some demons will serve more willingly and faithfully than others.  The
details of which demons serve willingly and which resist service even
when bound are discussed under the heading dealing with each
particular demon.  A summoner may control only one bound demon at a
time, though they may summon other demons (or non-demonic entities)
for purposes of conversation.  They may voluntarily dismiss a demon at
any time prior to the end of its service and the demon is immediately
returned to its own dimension unless it has already broken the binding
and turned on the summoner.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

There are no Special Knowledge Spells for this College.

\subsection{Special Knowledge Rituals}
\label{greater.summonings:special.rituals}

There are six separate Special Knowledge Rituals.  Each is designed to
summon a particular Rank of demon.  There are six Ranks of demons:
Duke, Prince, President, Earl, Marquis, and King.  Each Rank is
subject to certain limitations as to where and when it can be
summoned.

All Ranks of demons are summoned in the same manner.  The summoner
announces the demon they are summoning and that demon's Rank.  They
then performs the appropriate Ritual of Summoning.  At the end of the
ritual (that is after one hour), a check is made to see if the ritual
has been effective.  The summoner rolls D100.  If the result is equal
to or less than the Base Chance of summoning the particular demon that
is the object of the ritual, the demon is summoned and appears before
the summoner.  Otherwise, the demon does not appear and the summoner
may not make a further attempt to summon that demon that day.  They
may attempt to summon another demon instead but must first repeat the
Ritual of Cleansing.  The description of each demon lists the Base
Chance to summon that demon.

Special Knowledge Rituals may only be performed on days 2, 4, 6, 8,
10, 12 and 14 of the cycle of the moon, Luna.  They may be attempted
on other days, but can never have any effect. There is a possibility
that an Adept could lose track of time and attempt to employ a Special
Knowledge Ritual on a day when it will not work.  In such cases, the
GM may choose not to inform the individual that the ritual can have no
effect and may allow them to perform it anyway, only telling the
player why they have been unable to summon a demon at the end of the
ritual.

An Adept who knows a particular Ritual of Summoning may summon any of
the demons of that Rank Each description includes: the demon's name;
the Base Chance of summoning (and binding) it; the percentage chance
that the demon will agree to grant the summoner a companion from among
its legions of lesser spirits; the special talents, skills and magical
abilities of the demon; a quantification (given as a span of possible
numbers) of the demon's characteristics; the demon's natural armour
(given under the heading NA as the number of hits absorbed for each
Strike); the natural weapons of the demon (and any other weapons
habitually carried), and any special comments on the demon's nature or
abilities.  Also included is a short physical description of the
demon.

Once a demon is dismissed (returned to its own dimension) it cannot
return to this plane in less than a day.  A demon who has been
dispelled by a counterspell or rendered unconscious may return to this
plane (by being re-summoned in a new ritual) only after one full month
in its own plane (spent reforming the scattered energy pulses that
make up its being).

Demons may be controlled while the summoner stands within the Pentacle
which they must draw to perform the summoning ritual.  They will speak
to the summoner under this circumstance and will sometimes tell the
truth.  To ensure absolute honesty, a Ritual of True Speaking must be
performed.  To ensure that the demon will not destroy the summoner
once the ritual is over, a Ritual of Binding must be performed.  A
demon who is not bound must be dismissed at the end of the summoning
(once the summoner has finished speaking to the demon) and will then
usually return to its own plane.  However, a demon who is particularly
savage or who has been offered a gift which it rejects will attempt to
devour the summoner before departing.  The summoner must then make a
check against the Willpower to determine if the summoner breaks the
magical circle protecting them and fights the demon or remains safely
within the Pentacle (in which case, the frustrated demon departs).

Adepts are not provided with a Shield when they are admitted to
membership in the College of Greater Summoning, as a Shield is not
necessary to perform the rituals of the College.  However, they may
wish to make or have made a special Shield (actually a disc of metal
engraved with symbols of occult power) to protect them during the
summoning of demons. This shield is made by Adepts of the College of
Shaping Magics --- see Arcane Wisdom.  A summoner who does not have a
Shield can suffer a backfire.  A summoner who is using the proper
Shield cannot suffer a backfire.  A backfire from a Special Knowledge
Ritual consists of the appearance of the demon being summoned, but
inside the circle of protection (Pentacle) so that the demon is free
to attempt to destroy the summoner.  In such cases, the demon may be
returned to its own dimension by a counterspell or by being rendered
unconscious, but will otherwise remain on this plane and freely roam
about attacking and destroying until somehow banished.  It will not,
however begin roaming the earth until it has destroyed its summoner.
A backfire occurs whenever an Adept rolls a number which is 30 or more
than the modified Base Chance of summoning a particular demon while
making a check to see if that demon is summoned. A backfire is treated
as ``no effect'' if the summoner has the proper Shield in their hand
during the ritual.

The individual Shields that will protect a summoner from backfire are
discussed under each individual Ritual of Summoning.  Shields only
affect the summoning of demons.  There is no backfire due to an
ineffective attempt at employing any other Ritual of Summoning.
Rituals of True Speaking and Binding may backfire (regardless of
whether or not a Shield is employed) and result in the summoner being
affected by their own ritual and forced either to answer all questions
of the demon as truthfully as possible or to serve the demon so long
as the demon remains on this plane.  This backfire result may be
passively resisted.

\textbf{Note:} The interaction between a player and the ``demon
characters'' they summon is the most important aspect of the workings
of this College, and the GM should strive to keep players on their
toes by developing the demonic character as fully as possible (making
it cooperative about some things and uncooperative about others, for
example).  Some demons are savage in the extreme and will always be
out to do what damage they can short of murdering the summoner (and
sometimes that is not excluded).  Others are milder and will pass up a
golden opportunity to devour their summoner.  The notes on individual
demons are meant to serve as a guide to their characters as well as
their abilities. Their descriptions also give the forms in which they
may appear.  Often, these forms will be insubstantial and the demon
will have no power (nor will anyone have power over it) while it is in
those forms.  However, the information is included as clues for the GM
in structuring the demonic character.

\begin{ritual}[R-1]{Summoning Demonic Dukes}

\multiple{300}
\begin{effects}
This ritual is used to summon the following demons from the seventh
plane: Agares, Aim, Alloces, Amdusias, Astaroth, Barbatos, Bathin,
Berith, Bune, Crocell, Dantalion, Eligos, Furcalor, Furcas, Gremory,
Gusion, Havres, Murmur, Sallos, Uvall, Valefor, Vapula, Vephar and
Zepar.  The demons of this Rank may only be summoned between sunrise
and noon on days when the weather is clear and the sun can be seen.
Any attempt to perform this ritual at any other time will be totally
ineffective.

The only Shield that will protect against the possibility of backfire
while summoning Dukes is a disk of purest copper 12 inches across,
inscribed with the names and signs of all the Dukes of the seventh
plane.  This shield may only be manufactured by a Shaping mage. It
weighs 2 pounds and the average cost of manufacture will be 3000+
Silver Pennies. It takes about three months to manufacture.
\end{effects}

\begin{ritual}[R-2]{Summoning Demonic Princes}

\multiple{350}
\begin{effects}
This ritual is used to summon the following demons from the seventh
plane: Gasp, Ipos, Orobas, Seir, Sitri, Siolas, Vassago.  These demons
may be summoned at any time of the day.

The only Shield that will protect against the possibility of backfire
while summoning Princes is a disk of hammered tin inscribed with
the names and symbols of the Princes of the seventh plane.  This
Shield may only be manufactured by a Shaping mage.  It weights 3
pounds and the average cost of manufacture will be 3000+ Silver
Pennies.  It takes about three months to manufacture.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

The only shield that will protect against the possibility of backfire
while summoning Presidents is a disk of base metal (other than cold
iron) coated with quicksilver.  This shield may only be manufactured
by a Shaping mage.  It weighs 3 pounds and the average cost to
manufacture will be 4000+ Silver Pennies.  It takes about four months
to manufacture.
\end{effects}

names of the Kings of the seventh plane.  This Shield may only be
manufactured by Shaping magicians.  It weighs three pounds and the
average cost of manufacture will be 15,000 Silver Pennies.  It will
take about six months to manufacture.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Additional Notes}

\subsubsection{Hexagram}

A Hexagram is a symbol drawn on a parchment of calf's skin, covered
with a cloth of fine white linen, and draped from the girdle of lion's
skin outside the white robe worn by a Greater Summoner.  It helps
cause the demon to take physical form and compels them to be obedient.

\subsubsection{Counterspells}

Counterspells, as they relate to the College of Greater Summoning, are
used as a form of banishment.  When a General Knowledge Counterspell
is cast over an Imp, Devil, Succubi, Incubi, or Hero by the Adept who
either was granted the companion or summoned the entity, that entity
or companion is banished back to the dimension from whence it came.  A
counterspell cast by anyone else will have no effect whatsoever.  If a
Special Knowledge Counterspell is cast over a Summoned Demon by the
Adept that Demon is banished back to the plane from whence it came.
It should be emphasised here that counterspells can only be passively
resisted, and it is up to the GM to decide which Demons, once summoned
to this plane, will resist being sent back.

\subsubsection{Knowing the past, present or future}

In reference to Imps and Devils, the 7\% Base Chance of knowing past,
present and future events represents the chance they will know the
correct answer to a specific question posed to them. It is up to the
GM to perform the roll and decide what their answer (if any) will be
if the result is above the Base Chance.

the demons of that Rank.  The demons of each Rank are listed and
described in the section dealing with the ritual used to summon those
demons.  Each description includes: the demon's name; the Base Chance
of summoning (and binding) it; the percentage chance that the demon
will agree to grant the summoner a companion from among its legions of
lesser spirits; the special talents, skills and magical abilities of
the demon; a quantification (given as a span of possible numbers) of
the demon's characteristics; the demon's natural armour (given under
the heading NA as the number of hits absorbed for each Strike); the
natural weapons of the demon (and any other weapons habitually
carried), and any special comments on the demon's nature or abilities.
Also included is a short physical description of the demon.  Demons
may choose to bring along one or more hellhounds when summoned.

Demons are possessed of certain qualities not listed in their
descriptions.  All demons exercise their skills at Rank 15 and magic
powers at Rank 20.  Demons are not subject to specific Grievous
Injuries.  Instead, they suffer Endurance damage.  They can only be
harmed by magic or by silvered weapons.  Being creatures of mana, they
are not prevented from performing magic by the presence of cold iron.
A demon automatically recovers from all injury by spending one full
day in its own dimension.  Once a demon is dismissed (returned to its
own dimension) it cannot return to this plane in less than a day.  A
demon who has been dispelled by a counterspell or rendered unconscious
may return to this plane (by being re-summoned in a new ritual) only
after one full month in its own plane (spent reforming the scattered
energy pulses that make up its being).

Thus Namers become important individuals in the control of the demon
world on this plane.  It should be emphasised here that counterspells
can only be passively resisted, and it is up to the GM to decide which
Demons, once summoned to this plane, will resist being sent back.
d650 1

\subsubsection{Succubi and Incubi}

It is important to understand why Incubi and Succubi appear on this
plane at all in order to successfully GM them in a campaign.  They are
not intended to be the ``companions'' of any Adept.  Their sole
purpose is to increase the number of followers of the Powers of
Darkness on this plane.  They are representatives of this Power, and
as such, they cannot by themselves create anything.  Thus, they must
use mankind (members of both sexes) to aid in their mission.  By their
sexual activity, they seek to create children who are, in reality and
spirit, children of Darkness.

Because of their purpose, an Incubi will never kill the human he has
just mated with.  He will endeavour to keep the nature of his true
being from this woman so the child which he is trying to create will
be born and not aborted.  It is to be assumed that any mating between
Incubi and a human female will automatically result in a pregnancy
unless aborted.  For more detailed information on this subject, a good
reference is The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology by Russell
Hope Robbins (New York Crown Publishers, 1959).

Imps and devils are described below (see Monsters for a description
of the terminology used herein):

\subsubsection{Imps}

\textbf{Description:}
Imps appear as three to four foot high humanoids, but with horns,
bat's wings and barbed tails.  They tend to be muscular, but
pot-bellied.  Their skin may be blue, green, or purple, but is usually
red.  They have yellow eyes, flecked with silver and their teeth
(including prominent incisors) are made of silver.  Imps may also
appear as goats, spiders, bats or large rats, but these are
insubstantial forms. The imp cannot use his powers in this plane
except in his natural and substantial form.

\textbf{Talents, Skills and Magic:} Imps may be members of any Colleges
of Magic except the Entities as determined by the GM.  Imps can only
be harmed by silvered weapons or magic. Cold iron does not affect
them.  They have no skills.  They have Rank 5 with all magic.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lll}
\multicolumn{3}{c}{Movement Rates (yards per minute):} \\
\multicolumn{3}{c}{Running: 350 --- Flying: 500} \\
PS: 15--20	& MD: 13--17 	& AG: 16--22 \\
MA: 22--26	& EN: 14--16 	& FT: 22--28 \\
WP: 28--32	& PC: 16--25	& PB:  3--5 \\
TMR: 7 / 10	& \multicolumn{2}{l}{NA: 3 DP per Strike} \\
\end{tabularx}

\textbf{Weapons:} Imps may make a horn attack during Close Combat with
a Base Chance of 20\% and possible damage of [D - 1].  Imp horns may
have a Rank of between 1 and 10 (controlling Player should roll D10 to
determine Rank).  Imps may also make an attack in either Melee or
Close Combat with their long tail. Its tip contains a sting with a
quick acting nerve poison (2--4 Damage Points per Pulse). The sting
itself is treated like a dagger.  Base Chance with tail is 30\%.  Imps
may use other weapons, but may not wear armour.

\textbf{Comments:} Imps are dangerous servants in that they have a
cruel sense of humour which they are not averse to visiting upon their
master and friends.  They may not be bound or forced to speak true, so
there is no way to really control their actions.  They will lie,
steal, sow dissension, or play practical jokes (magical or
non-magical) on the average once per day (total).  They will not
knowingly get their master killed or maimed but are otherwise not
overly considerate of the master's wellbeing.  They will use their
powers on the master's behalf when it is demanded of them (though even
here their sense of humour may have an effect) and will fight the
master's enemies.  Imps may be called upon as needed and then returned
to their own dimension.  Given their warped personalities, the wise
master will keep them in their own dimension as much as possible.
Imps have a 7\% Base Chance of knowing past, present and future
events, but will seldom speak truthfully of what they know.

\subsubsection{Devils}

\textbf{Description:} Devils appear as large muscular humanoids with
massive bat wings, horns and fangs.  They tend to have carmine skin
and green eyes.  Their tails are sharp and barbed and contain a
poisonous sting.

\textbf{Talents, Skills and Magic:} Devils, like imps, may be members
of any College (except the Entities) as determined by the GM. Devils
can only be harmed by silvered weapons or by magic.  Cold iron does
not affect them.  They have no skills, but possess Rank 10 with all
magic of their College.  Devils know a little of the past, present,
and future of things (7\% chance of accuracy) and will speak
truthfully to the best of their knowledge in exchange for their
freedom.  They may not be bound or subjected to a Ritual of True
Speaking.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lll}
\multicolumn{3}{c}{Movement Rates (yards per minute):} \\
\multicolumn{3}{c}{Running: 400 ---  Flying: 500} \\
PS: 25--30	& MD: 15--20	& AG: 18--24 \\
MA: 28--34	& EN: 25--30	& FT: 35--40 \\
WP: 24--28	& PC: 22--26	& PB: 2--3 \\
TMR: 8 / 10	& \multicolumn{2}{l}{NA: 5 DP per  Strike} \\
\end{tabularx}

\textbf{Weapons:} Devils may make a horn attack or bite in Close Combat
and may sting with their tail in Melee or Close Combat.  Their bite
has a Base Chance of 30\% and does [D + 2] damage.  Their horns have a
Base Chance of 25\% and do [D + 2] damage.  Both are Rank 1--10
(controlling Player rolls D10 to determine exact Rank).  Their tail
has a Base Chance of 30\% in Melee and a Base Chance of 50\% Close
Combat and does [D - 1] damage.  It has a quick-acting nerve poison in
it that does 3--5 Damage Points per Pulse.  A devil's tail is always
Rank 8.  A Devil may use weapons, but will not wear armour.

\textbf{Comments:} Devils are extremely powerful companions, but tend
to serve only with reluctance.  They will attempt to bargain for their
freedom in exchange for the use of their magic powers in any situation
that does not involve immediate danger of death or maiming of their
master.  They are required to assist the master only in situations of
imminent danger and so will usually be able to bargain successfully
early in their service.  Their power to see things past, present, and
future is the same as that of imps (7\%).  They will never use this
talent except in exchange for their release from service and return to
their own plane.

Succubi are lesser spirits of the seventh plane.  They always appear
in the form of tall, beautiful women with flowing hair which hides
their small horns.  They also possess membranous wings shaped like
bat's wings that fold down so as to be all but invisible when not in
use.  They have retractable fangs which they sometimes use to open the
veins of those individuals whose blood they desire to drink.

Succubi possess Rank 10 in all spells and talents of the College of
the Mind.  In addition they possess the following skills: assassin,
courtesan, spy, thief and troubadour. All skills of Succubi are Rank
10.  Succubi possess the following characteristics:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lll}
PS: 16--21	& MD: 24--28	& AG: 28--32 \\
MA: 26--30	& EN: 12--16	& FT: 24--28 \\
WP: 26--30	& PC: 24--28	& PB: 26--34 \\
TMR: 7 / 8	& \multicolumn{2}{l}{NA: 2 DP per Strike} \\
\end{tabularx}

Succubi have a movement rate while running of 350 yards per minute and
while flying of 400 yards per minute.

Succubi may attempt to bite during Close Combat with a Base Chance of
40\%.  Their bite does [D + 2] damage to Fatigue each Pulse.  This
drain continues so long as they continue to bite (they need not make
another Strike Check).  The Succubi will cease biting only when they
have become stunned or unconscious or when their victim is dead.  They
never inflict specific Grievous Injuries, but may do Endurance damage.
Their bite may be Rank 1--10 (roll D10 to determine its exact Rank).
Succubi do not wear armour and carry only small weapons that are easily
concealed.  They prefer envenomed weapons to all others.

Succubi will, at the behest of their summoner, attempt to meet,
seduce, and then murder any individual of the summoner's choice.  They
will pursue their victim until returned to their own plane or until
they succeed in killing him. Their speciality is to gain the
confidence of the victim and then murder him in his bed.  They cannot
be harmed except by magic or by the touch of the Book of Toth, an
ancient tome of magical lore found only in older and seldom frequented
libraries.  This rare volume immediately and permanently dissipates
them, forcing them back to their own plane.

This ritual may be used to summon one or more Succubi, who will then
do the summoner's bidding without the necessity of being bound. At the
beginning of the ritual, the summoner states how many Succubi he is
attempting to summon.  The summoner's Player then rolls D100.  If the
resulting number is equal to or less than the Base Chance to
successfully enact the ritual, the summoner is successful and the
requisite number of Succubi immediately appear.  The Base Chance of

Q-2 Ritual of Summoning Succubi

     This  ritual   may   be   used   to   summon   one
or   more   Succubi,   who   will   arrive   on    this
plane   favorably    disposed    towards    the    sum-
moner   for   having   summoned    them,    and    thus
will  not  immediately   need   to   be   bound.   Suc-
cubi  arrive  on  this  plane  with  only   one   goal:
the    enticement    and    mating     with     humans.
Any    deed    the    summoner    desires    of    them
which  will  further  their  goal  will   be   approved
and  encouraged   by   the   Succubi.   If   the   Suc-
cubi   are   summoned   to   perform   a    task    not
immediately  related   to   their   goal,   they   will
have  to  be  Bound  and  forced  to   do   the   task.
The  BaseChance  is  5%(+3  per  Rank),   and   it   is
reduced   by   10   for   each   Succubi   above    one
being  summoned  at   once.   If   the   ritual   back-
fires,  the.Succubi  will   appear   and   attempt   to
molest    and-then    devour    the    summoner     and
his or her companions.

     It  is  important  to   understand   why   Incubi
a@@  Succubi  appear   on   this   plane   at   all   in
order   to   successfully   GM   them   in    a    cam-
paign.  They  are  not  intended  to   be   the   "com-
panions"  of  any  Adept.   Their   sole   purpose   is
to  increase   the   number   of   followers   of   the
Powers  of   Darkness   on   this   plane.   They   are
representatives   of   this   Power,   and   as   such,
they   cannot   by    themselves    create    anything.
Thus,   they   must    use    mankind    (members    of
both sexes to aid  in  their  mission.  By  their  sex-
ual  activity,  they  seek  to  create   children   who
are, in  reality  and  spirit,  children  of  Darkness.

     The  first fantasy role-playing            games
were     basicallydungeon     oriented,     and     requir-

the     adventures     would     occur.     Soon      deve-

pre-generated     dungeon.     As     FRP     games     be-

scenarios    and    supplements     created     to     sup-

was   created   for   use   with   only    one    set    of
game     rules.     Some     supplements     were      pub-

Both    the    setting    and    the    characters     were

for despite the wealth  of  material  there  are
no  complete  scenarios  per  se",  there   are,
however,   ten   "scenario   ideas,    extensive
encounter  tables,  and   manifold   hints   and
suggestions for would-be Game Masters.

     Thieves'World  is  not  one  of  the  vague-
enough-to-be-universal  types  of  work.  It  is
not usable with  every  role-playing  game,  but
has  been  customized  for  nine  of  them  (the

has    been    accomplished    in     the     Personalities
of    Sanctuary    book    by    having    people     well-
versed   in   the   game   involved   (in   five    instan-
ces,    the    original    designers    of    the    games)
provide   the   NPC   stats   and   in   most   cases    an
essay    reconciling    the    rules    of    the     games
with the world of Sanctuary.

     To   a   large   extent    the    explanations    deal
with   magic.   In   general,   an   FRP   game    has    a
single   system   of   magic,   one   that   is    distinct
from   those   of   other   games.   The    two    Thieves'
World    anthologies     have     as     many     different
magic    systems    as    there    are    magicians,     as
eachwascreatedbyadifferentauthor.                      Even
the   prevalence   of   magic   is   hard   to   reconcile,
ranging   as   it   does   from   games   like    Traveller
in   which   there    s    no    magic    (the    sophistry
which    rationalizes    this     problem     makes     for
interesting    reading)    to    RuneQuest,    in     which
anyone   with   a   few   points   of   Power    and    the
price of a spell can perform it,
     Players    who     require     fastidious     consis-
tency   may   be   annoyed   by   a   feature    of    this

the    NPC    stats    listed    the    characters     they

Kadakithis  appears  in  the  D&DTM  game   sec-
tion as a ninth-level fighter  but  in  the  C&S
section  as  only  a  level  three  non-fighter.
Others may not vary  so  widely,  but  the  phe-
nomenon  of  differing  perceptions   led   Eric
Goldberg  to  provide   the   DragonQuest   game
stats with ranges of attribute values  so  indi-
vidual GM's could use  values  they  liked  that
were still "official."
     Of the few drawbacks  little  can  be  said.
As noted, there  are  no  ready-to-play  scenar-
ios  presented,  but  plenty  of   ingredients   f   or   a
competent   GM   to   use   in    conducting    a    super-
ior   one   by   himself.   The   exigencies   of   forcing
the   various   magic   systems    tG    fit    the    con-
straints   of   the   stories   may    be    an    annoying
inconvenience     in     some      circumstances.      Each
user  will  have   to   decide   for   himself   if   Sanc-
tuary  exists  in  his  universe,  If  it  does,  there  is
the    problem    of    howto     morefullyintegrate     it
and    make     the     inhabitants     consistent     with
the   previously   defined    portions.    If    it    does
not,    the    GM    must    decide    by    what     means
(inter-dimensional      portals?       space       travel?)
the    player     characters     arrive     there.     Some
gamers     may     be     disappointed      that      their
favorite  FRPG  is  not cove red     in     Thieves'
World.  Just   as   there   are   to   be   more   antholo-

slum    hopes    to    update    the    game    with    new
systems in the future.
     In    summary,    Thieves'    World    is    not     a
@@ork  that  allows   a   GM   to   spend   merely   a   few

dirty  trick  of  having  the  hero  arrive   in   a   bat-

Ritual    difficult    enough    to    perform     success-
fully  in  the  first  place,  there  is   no   reason   to
play little "games" with the players.

There is no Base Chance for this ritual being successful.  The Adept
states the number of hours he will expend on the ritual and at the end
of that period of time, the Adept is cleansed.  He may perform no
other activity while engaged in this ritual.  If his concentration is
broken, he must restart the cleansing from the beginning or abandon
the effort.  Any rituals the Adept desires to perform after the
cleansing must be performed immediately.  He may perform any number of
rituals within three hours of the cleansing, but these rituals must
immediately follow each other.  Any time spent in any other activity
destroys the effects of the cleansing and a new cleansing must be

service of the Demon except for conversation and teaching of Skills,

the summoner may not make a further attempt to summon that demon that

telling the player why he has been unable to summon a demon at the end
of the ritual.

make a check against the summoner's Willpower to determine if the

membership in the College of Greater Summoning.  Such is not necessary
to perform the rituals of the College.  However, they may wish to make
or have made a special Shield (actually a disc of metal engraved with
symbols of occult power) to protect them during the summoning of
demons (this shield is made by Adepts of the College of Shaping Magics
- see Arcane Wisdom).  A summoner who does not have a Shield can
suffer backfire.  A summoner who is using the proper Shield cannot
suffer backfire.  Backfire from a Special Knowledge Ritual consists of
the appearance of the demon being summoned, but inside the circle of
protection (Pentacle) so that the demon is free to attempt to destroy
the summoner.  In such cases, the demon may be returned to his own
dimension by a counterspell (or by being rendered unconscious), but
will otherwise remain on this plane and freely roam about attacking
and destroying until somehow banished.  It will not, however begin
roaming the earth until it has destroyed its summoner.  Backfire
occurs whenever a player rolls a number which is 30 or more greater
