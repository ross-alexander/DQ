@\begin{college}[2.0]{namer}{Naming Incantations}{NA}

\textbf{This version of the College is probationary, and is under
trial for two years (as of September 2001).  All characters that join
this College do so under the understanding that if this version is
deemed unplayable, it may be withdrawn or radically changed.  At that
point, all such characters may revert to the previous version or have
the EP and time spent in this College refunded, to be re-spent freely
in another College as if that College had been their original choice.}

The College of Naming Incantations is concerned with the essential
truths and underlying realities that make up the world and with the
knowledge of auras and true names.  Naming Incantations is one of the
two oldest Colleges of Magic and just as the Entities branch grew out
of runic magic so too do the Thaumaturical Colleges have their roots
in Naming.  Adepts of this College are commonly called Namers.

The Naming College holds that magic is a form of deception, a
manipulation of reality, whereby Mages use mana to impose their will
on the world. The College's abilities include divining the true nature
of things and enforcing those truths by protecting against and
preventing magic.  Living beings express their true nature and
intrinsic essence in their auras and names, and Namers study these in
order to understand, protect, restore, and gain control over them. It
is said that in the ancient days Namers were capable of commanding the
sea, the wind, and the rocks by their names --- but if this is true
then that knowledge has long been lost. Namers still learn the names
of the plants that grow in the earth, but they have little influence
over them.

Many Namers also learn the healing arts, and perhaps this is linked to
a desire to restore beings to their true state.

Given its abilities in neutralising magic, and the low Magical
Aptitude requirement, the College attracts considerable interest from
individuals engaged in the arts of war. Many Adepts use it as a means
to protect themselves against hostile magics, while they operate in a
more physical manner.

\textbf{Traditional Colours:} No particular colour has a strong
association with the College, as astrologically magic is of all
colours, and of none.

\textbf{Traditional Symbols:} Members of this College sometimes wear
small symbols made of iron, (insufficient to cause them any
inconvenience), symbolising their ability to neutralise magic. Circles
or spheres are very common, harkening perhaps to circles of
protection.

\textbf{Magical Aptitude:} The MA requirement for this College is 1.

\subsection{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Naming Incantations may practise their arts
without restriction. Some abilities may require that the Namer know a
particular Generic or Individual True Name, or have learned a
particular Counterspell.

\subsection{Benefits}

\subsubsection{Language}

Due to their knowledge of True Names, Namers may Rank any Language in
the Protonic Language Group as if they already know another language
in that group at Rank 5. (See Languages \S\ref{languages:groups}).

\subsubsection{Ranking Names}
\label{namer:ranking}

\begin{Itemize}
\item Both Generic and Individual True Names take 1 week \x Rank to be
achieved.

\item Ranking Names requires no EM.

\item The maximum Rank for True Names is 20.

\item Ranking of Names may be done alongside other forms of Ranking.

\item Namers may Rank one Name in addition to other forms of ranking.
\end{Itemize}

\subsubsection{Modifications}

The following numbers are added to the Base Chance of performing any
talent, spell or ritual of the College of Naming Incantations:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
Never before encountered target's generic type		& -15\% \\
Has not learned target's Generic True Name		& -10\% \\
Each Rank achieved with target's Generic True Name	& +1\% \\
Each Rank achieved with target's Individual True Name	& +2\% \\
\end{tabularx}

All modifiers are cumulative. 

In addition, each Rank achieved with the target's Individual True Name
reduces the target's Magic Resistance by 1\%.

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Detect Aura}
\multiple{75}
\basechance{2 \x PC  ( + 5 / Rank)}
\resist{May only be actively resisted}
\target{Entity, Object, Area, Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Base Chance is reduced by 1\% for every foot after the first five
from the Adept. See the Detect Aura Talent (\S\ref{magic:detect-aura})
for the results of this talent. In addition to other information
gained, the Namer also receives the target's Generic True Name, if
any.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Expel Magic}

\multiple{75}
\resist{May only be passively resisted}
\target{Object, Area, Volume}
\begin{effects}
This talent allows the Namer to dissipate a magical spell stored in a
Ward, Magical Trap, Potion, or Invested Item. In order to use this
talent, the Namer must specify the name of the spell to be affected
and cast the appropriate Counterspell on the target with the specific
intent of dissipating the stored magic. The chance of the stored magic
resisting destruction is 50\% [( + 3 / Rank of the stored magic) (- 3
/ Rank of this Talent)]. If successful all of the magic of the same
type stored within the target is destroyed. The appropriate
Counterspell is the one that affects the magic stored not the storing
magic. For example, a Ward of Enchanted Sleep would require the use of
an E \& E General Knowledge Counterspell. Possessions gain a single
Resistance Check but use the better of the chance above, or their
wielder's MR.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-3]{Quick Cast}
\begin{effects}
Namers may cast any Counterspell that they know without preparing it
first.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge spells}

The entire general spell knowledge of the Namer college consists of
the ability to cast Counterspells. A Namer may cast a Rank 0
Counterspell against any College of magic with which they are
familiar. Counterspells at Rank 0 do not count towards the Namers MA
limit for spells and rituals.

Familiarity with all of the commonly encountered Colleges will be
taught to a Namer during their apprenticeship, and beginning Namers
will have the ability to cast all of the Counterspells of the standard
Colleges at Rank 0.  If a Namer encounters Colleged magic of a form
with which they are not familiar they may familiarize themselves with
the College by one of the following methods:

\begin{Itemize}
\item By using the Ritual of Divination on an Adept of that College.

\item By Divinating a magical effect produced by that College,
provided that it is still in effect.

\item By spending a day's study with a Namer who is already familiar
with the College.
\end{Itemize}

Once they have done this they will be able to cast Rank 0
Counterspells against that college.

Unlike other Adepts, Namers may gain Rank with Counterspells that are
not of their College. Namers rank all Counterspells as General
Knowledge spells of the Namer College. Once a Namer begins to rank a
Counterspell it will count towards the Namers MA limit for spells and
rituals as normal.

For full details on the use of Counterspells see 10.2 

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Dissipation}

\target{Entity, Object, Area, Volume}
\basechance{As per Counterspell + Ritual preparation}
\casttime{1+ hours, maximum 10}
\actions{Concentration}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
By engaging in Ritual Spell Preparation a Namer may use a Counterspell
to dissipate the effects of a spell.  The Namer must perform at least
one hour of Ritual Spell Preparation at the end of which they must
cast the appropriate Counterspell, and specify the name of the spell
to be dissipated. Only spells (not rituals) may be dissipated using
this technique. It is not possible to achieve Rank with this ability
since it is not an independent ritual, but rather a specialized use of
Ritual Spell Preparation.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Bane}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{30 seconds + 5 / Rank} 
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell strengthens reality and stabilizes the mana in an area 15
feet in diameter (+ 10 / 5 Ranks) such that all magical Cast Chances
are reduced within the area by 5\% (+ 3 / Rank).  This will affect
spells and rituals, and talents with base chances. The spell has no
affect on stored magics (such as invested items), shaped items, or
magic without base chances.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Banishment}

\range{Self}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{No}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
Through use of this spell, a Namer may banish a summoned being back to
its own plane. While the banishment spell is in effect, the
appropriate Counterspell cast by the Namer at a summoned entity will
cause the entity to return to its own plane, unless it resists. The
Counterspell must match the type of spell or ritual used in the
summoning of the creature. In general the spells/rituals affected are
the elemental summonings (Summon Fire Elemental, etc.), all Greater
Summonings, Dark/Light Sphere conjuration and Fire college Efreeti and
Salamander summoning. The Call Patron ability of Agents is not
classified as a summoning spell and is not affected.  The being to be
banished may actively and passively resist the Counterspell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Compel Obedience}
\range{15 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: max. 10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\target{Entity}
\storage{None}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may cast this spell over 1 (+ 1 / 4 Ranks) targets whose
Generic True names are known to them. Those targets who fail to resist
may be commanded by the Adept to perform actions that are both within
their physical capabilities and in their true natures. Commands are
given in the Namer tongue and will be understood by all entities.
Commands must be short and simple, such as: ``Stop!'', ``Wait here'',
``Follow me'', ``Hide under the table''. Entities can only be
compelled to perform actions that they might perform naturally. For
example, brigands who were involved in a combat might be compelled to
``Flee!'', but if those same brigands felt they were winning the
fight, they would heed no such compulsion but could perhaps be
directed to a different target. If the spell is cast at targets with
different GTNs the Namer must use the lowest applicable base chance
modifier.

If the Adept chooses to pronounce a target's Individual True Name as
part of the spell then only one entity may be affected but the Namer
is vested with much greater control over that entity, even against its
nature. It is possible for the target to defy the Namer, but there are
serious consequences for disobediance. Should the target decline to
obey any command of the caster that is not obviously suicidal, they
must make a WillPower check of [1 \x WP - (1\% per Rank that the Namer
has with the target's ITN)]. This check does not break the spell.
Should the target fail their check, they will feel great pain and
immediately take damage equal to half of the Namer's Rank with this
spell.  This damage cannot be resisted.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Disjunction}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{1 minute + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object, Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell prevents stored magics within an object or area from coming
into effect. Magics that are affected by this spell include Wards,
Invested items, Potions, Magical Traps, and permanent magics that need
to be triggered. If a potion under the effects of a Disjunction is
consumed, the potion will take effect after the spell effect ceases,
provided it is still inside an entity. Other items will simply be
unable to be triggered, and no charges will be lost.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Dispel Magic}

\range{Self}
\duration{5 seconds + 5 / 4 Ranks}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{5\%}
\resist{No}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
While the Dispel Magic is in effect, the appropriate Counterspell cast
at a target may dissipate magic. The Counterspell must match the type
of spell to be dissipated, and the Adept must specify the name of the
spell that they wish to remove. If the Counterspell is successfully
cast, the chance of the magic being dispelled is 50\% [(+ 3 / Rank
with Dispel Magic) (- 3 /Rank of the target magic)].  This spell
cannot remove the effects of rituals, or remove curses.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Forbidding}
\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
This spell creates a thin, invisible wall, 10 feet high and 20 feet
long. The Adept may increase either height or length by 1 foot per
Rank. This barrier obeys all of the usual rules for insubstantial
walls. A single Generic or Individual true name is crafted into the
forbidding. To those entities whose names are contained therein, or if
seen by means of Witchsight or similar, the wall appears bluish and
crackling with magical energy. If a Generic True Name is in the
forbidding, then to those named who fail to resist upon initial
contact the forbidding is completely solid to them and they are unable
to pass through it. If they resist, the barrier is insubstantial, as
it is those those who are not named by it. If an Individual True name
is placed in the forbidding then in addition to the Generic effects,
the entity must resist each contact with the barrier or suffer [D - 4] +
1 / Rank damage, even if they are able to pass through the wall
because they initially resisted.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Mana Sense}
\range{Self}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{No}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
This spell allows the adept to ``sense'' the mana flows within 10 feet
(+ 10 / Rank). If a spell is cast or magic triggered within range, the
Adept will see it flying off towards its target. Similarly, if the
target of any spell is within range, the Adept will see the magic
impact.  If the Adept chooses magical Pass actions of Concentration
with this spell in effect, they will be able to see Adepts drawing
mana, and be able to see if a target resists a spell or not. While
concentrating the Adept will have a (2 \x PC) chance of being able to
distinguish the College of the magic they can see, the name of the
spell, and whether the spell is low, medium, high or very high in
rank.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Scry Shield}
\range{10 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank or Special}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{No}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
This spell protects an area from scrying by Wizard Eyes, Crystals and
Waters of Vision, Bard's Ear and similar divinatory magics of a Rank
equal to or less than the rank of the Scry Shield. It does not prevent
normal vision, infravision, Witchsight and similar spells. A Scry
Shield is a shell over the protected volume, so once the area is
penetrated by any means, \eg on foot or by flying, spells cast inside
the protected volume work normally. At Rank 20 this spell alarms the
Adept that an attempt to divine into the volume by magical means has
taken place, provided that the Adept is within the volume at the time.
This spell may be cast as a ritual if the Adept so chooses.  In this
form casting takes 10 hours and the duration is increased to 4 weeks
(+ 1 / Rank).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Spell Barrier}

\range{10 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 minute + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{No}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Volume}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates a thin, glowing, translucent wall which blocks the
passage of magic. The barrier is either 10 feet high and 20 feet long
as a wall, or 10 feet high and 5 feet in radius as a ring. The Adept
may increase any dimension --- other than thickness --- by 1 foot per
Rank. This barrier obeys all of the usual rules for insubstantial
walls. Any magic cast in such a way that a direct line drawn from the
caster to their target passes through the wall (from either side) has
a 40\% [(+ 3 / Rank with this spell) (- 3 / Rank of the target magic)]
chance of having its energies dissipated. If a spell passes through
more than one Spell Barrier only a single roll for dissipation should
be made, with the highest dissipation chance being used.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{True Seeing}
\range{10 feet + 5 / 2 Ranks}
\duration{30 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{No}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
Within the area of the spell those things that have been magically
altered to appear other than they truly are may be detected. True
Seeing may detect invisible or insubstantial things, the visual
component of illusions, and entities and objects that have been
magically rearranged or transformed (such as by curses). The chance of
detecting such things with True Seeing will depend upon the rank of
this spell, and the rank of the concealing or transforming magic. For
odd magical abilities without a Rank the GM should substitute some
appropriate alternative (such as [MA - 10]).

\begin{inline}
\begin{Description}
\item[True Seeing is of lesser or equal Rank] Slight imperfections may
be revealed, (\eg invisible figures shimmer a little, the colour of an
illusion may appear a bit off, etc.), and there is a (1 \x PC) chance
of an observer scrutinizing the area noting this.

\item[True Seeing is of higher Rank] More major imperfections may be
noticed. (\eg invisible figures have a slight will-o'-the-wisp glow,
toads that are really Princes may have tiny gold crowns, ). The
detection chance rises to (2 \x PC).

\item[True Seeing is is 10+ Rank higher] The imperfections in
concealing and transforming magics become qutie obvious, (\eg
invisible figures appear ghostly, illusions may appear painted or
translucent, etc.). Detection is automatic.
\end{Description}
\end{inline}
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[R-1]{Divination}

\range{5 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{40\% + 10 / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour or 3 hours}
\resist{No}
\target{Entity, Object, Area}
\material{None}
\actions{Concentration}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
There is no possibility of backfire from this ritual. By use of this
ritual a Namer may determine if an individual, object, or area is
currently, or has been recently, under the effects of magic a spell by
employing the Ritual of Magic Divination. If the ritual is successful,
the nature of all magic in effect (exact names and Colleges) is
revealed to the Namer. If the magic is of non-college origin general
effects are revealed.  In the case of magic that is no longer in
effect, for each 5\% under the Cast Chance that the Namer rolled,
magic that expired an extra week ago is revealed.  For example if a
Namer rolled 12\% under their Cast Chance magic that expired upto two
weeks ago would be revealed --- in addition to all magic currently in
effect.

If the Namer wishes they may perform an Ancient Divination.  The Base
Chance of the ritual is reduced to 40\% (+ 2 / Rank), and the Cast Time
increased to 3 hours.  If successful the Namer will learn the exact
nature of all enchantments, magical mechanisms, triggering conditions,
curses, side-effects, etc., placed upon an entity or object even if
they are of non-college origin. If an object has an Individual True
Name the Ancient Divination will reveal its existence, though not the
actual name.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-2]{Expulsion}

\range{5 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{10\% + 5 / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\target{Entity}
\material{None}
\actions{Concentration}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
This Ritual will return one entity to its plane of origin, regardless
of how it got to the current plane. Upon completion of the ritual, if
the target fails to resist, they will be immediately returned to the
point from which they left their plane of origin.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-3]{Interregnum}

\range{10 feet}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{MA + 4\% / Rank}
\casttime{2 hours}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\target{Entity or Object}
\material{None}
\actions{Concentration}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
The targeted entity or object has all magical effects currently upon
them, that are of lesser or equal rank to the Interregnum, suspended.
Whilst suspended their durations will not reduce, but the magic will
have no effect. The duration of the Interregnum may be chosen by the
Adept at the time of casting, from a minimum of 1 day to a maximum of:

\begin{inline}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Rank} &
\textbf{Duration (maximum)} \\
0--10		& 1 day (+ 1 / Rank) \\
11--15		& 1 month \\
16--19		& 3 months \\
20		& 1 year \\
\end{tabular}
\end{inline}
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-4]{Remove Curse}
\begin{effects}
Namers have a greater ability to remove curses than do the Adepts of
other Colleges. Namers learn the normal Remove Curse ritual (see
\S\ref{ritual:removecurse}) as R4 of this College, but gain a bonus
to Base Chance of + 2 / Rank for Minor curses and + 1 / Rank for Major
curses (including Death Curses).
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-5]{Sealing}
\range{20 feet +20 / Rank}
\duration{1 day + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\% + 4 / Rank}
\casttime{1 hour}
\resist{None}
\target{Area}
\material{Chalk, paint, blood, cornmeal or other symbol
making materials}
\actions{Chanting and inscribing symbols}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
This Ritual seals an area against entities from a single, specific,
named plane. The name of the plane must be known to the Adept, and the
name of the plane that the Adept is currently occupying cannot be
used. No entity whose plane of origin has been sealed against can
voluntarily enter the sealed area. They will stop at the boundary and
refuse to go any further. Any entity taken into the area against their
will (or without their knowledge, \eg unconscious) will attempt to
leave the area as quickly as possible. If an attempt is made to summon
an entity from the named plane into the area the summoning will
fail. Any entities from the named plane who are inside the area when
the sealing is created are unaffected, but should they leave the area
they will be unable to re-enter it.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-6]{True Form}
\range{5 feet}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{20\% + 3 / Rank}
\casttime{3 hours}
\resist{Active}
\target{Entity, Object}
\material{None}
\actions{Concentration}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
By means of this ritual the Adept may force a target that has been
magically altered, cursed, or rearranged into a form other than their
natural one to assume their true form and nature. It will not remove
effects that could occur naturally. For example, the ritual would
restore the form of a human that had been cursed into the shape of a
toad, and would return to flesh a human turned to stone but would do
nothing to remove a curse of weeping sores or restore a lost limb.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[R-7]{True Speaking}
\range{10 feet}
\duration{30 minutes}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{40\% + 3 / Rank}

By means of this ritual the Adept may attempt to force an entity who
is present to speak the truth. The Adept must prepare for 30 minutes
after which they may question the entity for the remaining 30 minutes
of the 1 hour ritual. The effects of the ritual do not last beyond the
hour. The target need not answer or speak at all, but if they fail to
resist and they choose to answer the Adept's questions, they must, to
the best of their knowledge, speak no falsehoods. They need not
volunteer information. The GM rolls for the success of this ritual and
need not inform the Adept's player of the result.

\begin{college}[1.3]{namer}{Naming Incantations}{NA}
d3 38
a40 19
Members of the College of Naming Incantations specialise in the
knowledge of all True Names and of magic in general (counterspells in
particular); they are usually simply called Namers.

\index{names}
\index{names!generic}

All living beings have a Generic True Name and aura.  Formerly living
things retain their name and traces of their aura.  This name is in an
ancient language, and the translation into the common tongue would
yield such terms as man, elf, tiger, oak, bee, rattlesnake, rose, etc.
All such names when uttered in their ancient form by a Namer give the
Namer power to control the entity, and these Generic Names are taught
to an apprentice Namer during the Namer's training (the usual names
known are listed on a separate sheet as the Namer Names List).  The
familiarity with Names allow Namers to Rank any language in the
Protonic language group as if they know a language in the group at
Rank 5.  Namers may learn a Generic True Name they are not familiar
with by
d42 16
a57 6
\begin{Itemize}
\item By learning from another Adept who has the name ranked.
\item It may be found in written form - Adepts of various Colleges have
been known to record important species names in magic tomes.
\item By means of a Detect Aura (as outlined below).
\end{Itemize}
d59 1
a59 15
All sentient entities (player character races, dragons, mer-people,
naga, etc) have an Individual True Name.  This becomes known to them
upon reaching maturity.  All sane sentient entities will know their
own Individual True Name and no force -- physical or magical -- can
coerce the entity to reveal it.  They may choose to reveal it,
however.  An entity will be called by their given (or use) Name, which
is given to them by their parents.  The Individual True Name and the
Given Name will be in the entity's native tongue (thus the Namer would
have to spend time translating the Individual Name into the Namer
language before it could be used).  When an individual is born, their
Individual True Name becomes known to the Naming Demons (see the demon
descriptions in the College of Greater Summoning).  Namers know only
their own Individual True Name upon completing their education.  All
other Individual True Names must be acquired and learnt before they
can be used.  Three methods exist for acquiring an entity's True Name
d61 2
a62 1
\index{names!individual true name}
d65 2
a66 7
\item The entity may choose to reveal it.
\item It may be obtained from a Namer Demon (or any other being who knows
the True Name) if they choose to disclose it.
\index{demons!naming}
\item It may be found in written form - Adepts of various Colleges have
been known to record important entity's names in magic tomes.
\end{Itemize}
d68 1
a68 47
Once acquired, an Individual or Generic Name may be studied at any
time.  Generic Names take one day of study to be learned (that is
reach Rank 0) while Individual Names take one week in study after the
Name has been acquired.  Generic names take 1 week per Rank.
Individual names take 4 weeks per Rank.  Ranking of Names is not
exclusive, however.  This means that it can be done alongside other
forms of Ranking.  If not ranking anything else then the Namer can
rank three names at a time.  Names cannot be ranked while
adventuring.
\index{ranking!names}

Knowledge of an entity's True Name vests the Namer with a greater
control over that entity than that provided by the knowledge of its
Generic Name.  It provides the Namer with the ability to manipulate
that entity's aura, and hence affect its behaviour and condition for
short periods of time.  Entities protect their True Name vigorously
as this knowledge can be used both defensively and offensively.
Indeed, the very mention of an entity's True Name would strike great
fear into their heart.

The aura of the entity contains both the Generic and Individual True
Names, and so the training of the College of Namers concentrates
greatly on the study and interpretation of auras, from all living and
non-living matter.  This aura can be ``read'' (see T-1), providing the
Namer much information on the item/entity concerned.  Whilst other
Colleges use the Detect Aura spell/talent, only the Namer is trained
to make maximum use of the information gained from perceiving auras.
The Generic Name is instantly identified when a Namer perceives an
aura, although this Name must still be known and Ranked to be of
use. The information is coded into the aura in a form that Namers are
trained to recognise, but other Colleges, through use of the same
Detect Aura spell / talent, would need to inquire specifically to
receive the same information.  The Individual True Name is also coded
into the aura, but is so complex and varied that they cannot be
deciphered and used by even a Namer.  If the Namer is given the
Entity's True Name, then it is possible for the Namer to identify the
auric characteristics that make up the Individual True Name.  The
study of these components takes considerable time due to their
complexity.

One of the key capabilities of the Namer is to weave protective spells
over entities and locations, to defend against the use of Colleged
magic.  This ability comes both from the study of the various Colleges
of magic and the study of auric components.  The counterspell modifies
the entity's aura to aid in the defence against magic, and may prevent
the entity from using its own magical abilities.  Counterspells will
aid any item having an aura, whether living or not.
d70 1
a70 1
\subsection{Restrictions}
d72 2
a73 3
There are no special requirements for using the Naming Incantations,
beyond the need for ``knowing'' relevant Generic and Individual True
Names.
d75 2
a76 5
The MA requirement for this college is 1, since Rank 0 counterspells
do not count towards MA requirement for Namers.

Namers must keep a Name Book, which records the Generic and Individual
True Names they know, and at what ranks.
d78 1
a78 1
\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}
d80 3
a82 2
The following numbers are added to the Base Chance of performing any
talent, spell or ritual of the College of Naming Incantations:
d85 4
a88 4
Namer has never before encountered target's generic type & -15\% \\
Namer has not learned target's Generic True Name         & -10\% \\
Each rank achieved with target's Generic True Name       &   1\% \\
Each rank achieved with target's Individual True Name    &   5\% \\
d91 4
a94 5
These additions to the Base Chance are cumulative and are added onto
the Base Chance in addition to those modifiers listed in
\S\ref{magic:modifiers}.  Note that both Rank with a particular spell
or ritual and Rank in the use of the Name of the target affect the
Base Chance.

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}
d143 33
a175 30
The large body of General Knowledge consists of the ability to cast
counterspells against all Colleges of Magic.  Namers may loose a
counterspell without preparing it.  All counterspells are part of the
General Knowledge of each Namer when they complete their
apprenticeship.  They are known at Rank 0.  They do not count against
the number of spells and rituals a Namer may know unless and until
Ranked.  A Namer may know a number of spells and rituals (other than
counterspells) of Rank 5 or lower and a number of counterspells of
Ranks 1 to 5 equal to their Magical Aptitude.  For example, a
character could know 3 spells of Rank 5 or less and 12 counterspells
of Rank 1 through 5 if they had a Magical Aptitude of 15 (or any
combination of spells, counterspells and rituals equal to 15).  The
use of counterspells is described in section (\S
\ref{magic:counterspells}).

Namers can use counterspells to dissipate wards and investment rituals
(other spell effects can only be dissipated through the use of the
ritual of dissipation -- Q-1 below).  The appropriate counterspell
must be successfully cast on the area or object in question with the
specific intent of dissipating a ward or investment.  If the wrong
counterspell is thrown it will have no effect (and will leave no
trace).  Note that if the invested item is worn then it comes within
the personal sphere of the wearer and may be passively resisted.

Should any further Colleges be established after the apprenticeship is
completed, then the Adept will be able to gain the college
counterspells at Rank 0 immediately.  At present the Namer College
teaches new Namers counterspells of 16 colleges.  Each has a General
Knowledge and a Special Knowledge counterspell, so there are 32
counterspells which a new Namer knows.

a185 2
\basechance{That of the counterspell used}
\casttime{Up to 10 hours (Minimum 1)}
d187 8
a194 21
A Namer may always use any counterspell they presently know to cause
the effects of a spell cast over an individual or object to be
dissipated (removed) by performing the Ritual of Dissipation.  The
Adept treats the Ritual of Dissipation as if they were employing
Ritual Spell Preparation (see \S\ref{magic:preparation}) except that
they must cast the appropriate counterspell in order to accomplish the
dissipation of the spell.  In order to perform this ritual, the Namer
must know the exact name of the spell that was cast over the character
or object, what College the spell was a part of, and whether or not
the spell was a General or Special Knowledge spell.  Only spells (not
rituals) may be dissipated using this technique.  Only Namers may use
counterspells to dissipate spells once they have been cast, due to
their superior knowledge of the nature and characteristics of auras.
Adepts of other Colleges may use counterspells to send entities which
they have personally summoned back to their own dimensions.  In such
cases, the counterspell need not be cast as part of a ritual.  Only
Namers, however, may dispel magic by using this ritual.  At least 1
hour must be spent implementing this ritual.  The Adept may not simply
cast a counterspell over a character or object to achieve the same
effect.  Characters may never achieve Rank with this ritual, though
the specific counterspell used may be ranked.

d251 26
a276 25
The Adept may influence the actions of any one entity whose Generic
Name they know by casting a Spell of Charming over the individual.
If, in addition, the Adept knows and pronounces the victim's
Individual True Name, the Base Chance of the spell taking effect is
increased by 50\% and the effect of the spell is increased.  The
victim of the spell will then see the Adept as their true friend and
will readily accept most suggestions emanating from them.  Sworn
enemies of the Adept (or of their race) will not be affected by this
spell unless the victim's Individual True Name is spoken and, even
then, the duration of the spell is halved.

The Adept may either suggest actions to the victim or may order them
to act in a certain way on pain of losing the Adept's ``friendship''.
Any suggestion that is not directly and obviously inimical to the
victim's interests (as defined by the GM, but usually limited to
actions that would be injurious or fatal to the victim) will be acted
upon 90\% of the time.  The Adept may only ensure 100\% compliance
with a request by making it an order based upon the friendship that
binds the victim and Adept together.  In such instances, however, the
victim immediately makes a Resistance Check.  If they resist, then the
spell is broken.  Otherwise, the victim will accept the order and be
100\% faithful to it for the remainder of the spell.  Whenever any
suggestion is made that would lead to the victim's injury or death,
another Resistance Check is made.  If the check is unsuccessful, the
victim will accept the suggestion, otherwise the spell will be broken.

The Adept may cast this spell over any target(s) whose Generic or
Individual True Names are known to them.  Once successfully cast, the
spell permits the Adept to order the target to do anything within its
physical capabilities which is not obviously suicidal.  The spell may
affect a number of targets equal to or less than the Adept's Rank with
this spell.  The Base Chance is increased by 25\% if the Adept
pronounces the Individual True Name of all the spell's targets.
Zombies and Skeletons can not be compelled.  Plants may be compelled,
as can animals, but the Adept must be able to communicate with it and
the target compelled can only do what it is normally able to do (one
couldn't make a dog talk in a human voice, or make a plant uproot
itself and walk around for example).

No target may resist an order once it has failed to initially resist
the spell, although actions that are obviously suicidal will engender
a Willpower check (1 \x WP).  Note that this is the most
powerful of all the control spells -- only truly suicidal or very
repugnant acts (for example killing ones child or loved one) will
engender a Willpower check.

with the first recovery roll coming at the end of the pulse following
the spell's casting.  This spell will affect entities that do not
normally stun, such as demons and undead.

Through use of this spell, an Adept may banish a summoned being back
to its own plane.  While the banishment spell is in effect, the
appropriate counterspell cast at a summoned entity by the Adept will
cause the entity (unless it passively resists) to return to its own
plane.  The counterspell must match the type of spell/ritual used in
the summoning of the creature.  In general the spells/rituals affected
are the elemental summonings (Summon Fire Elemental, etc), all Greater
Summonings, Dark Sphere conjuration (Celestial R-1), and Fire college
Efreeti and Salamander summoning.  Call Master is not classified as a
summoning spell.  The base chance of the banishment is that of the
counterspell employed (including modifiers for generic and individual
names).  The being to be banished may actively and passively resist
the banishment.

This is a two part ritual.  The Adept may only use one part of the
ritual at any one time.  There is no possibility of backfire from this
ritual.

\begin{Enumerate}
\item
The Adept may determine if an individual or object is currently or has
been recently under the effects of a spell by employing the Ritual of
Magic Divination.  The Base Chance is reduced by 5\% for each week (or
fraction of a week) since the spell was cast.  Permanent magic (\eg
invested items still with charges) or spells currently in effect carry
no modifier.

\begin{example}
Rolf the Barbarian has had three spells on him 1, 2 and 3 weeks ago
respectively, and Moniker the Namer is rank 2 in the ritual, a cast of
50\% would mean the 1 and 2 week ago spells would be revealed but not
the spell of 3 weeks ago.  However if the 3 week ago spell was a
Lesser enchantment which was still in effect it would be revealed).
\end{example}

If the ritual is successful, the nature of the spell (its exact name
and College) is revealed to the Adept.  If the magic is of non-college
origin its precise effects are revealed.

\item
Through this ritual, the Adept can discover the exact nature of all
enchantments, triggering mechanisms, curses, side-effects etc, placed
upon an item.  Note that if an item has been imbued with an Individual
True Name it will not be revealed, but the fact that the item has a
Name will be.

A Namer who knows the Individual True Name of an entity may use this
ritual to summon the spirit of the individual to the location of the
ritual's enactment.  The ritual is keyed to the specific aura of the
victim through its Individual True Name.  The individual must be on
the same plane as the Adept.  If the ritual succeeds and if the victim
is within the range of effect, an extra-dimensional path will open and
the spirit and consciousness of the target will appear at the location
in an insubstantial form, taking on the habitus of the individual
being summoned (including clothes currently worn, weapons, etc -- good
enough for a locate spell to be used).  The spirit may not change
location once summoned, but may move its ``limbs'', and talk just as
if the person themselves were there.  The spirit may not be harmed by
any physical or magical attack, nor may it harm itself.  Telepathy and
suchlike will not affect the spirit, although the spirit will have a
readable aura.  The spirit may not use any magic, including talent
magic.  There is no compulsion on the spirit, who may answer questions
only as they see fit, and may converse at will.  However the spirit
must remain for the duration of the ritual (5 minutes + 5 / Rank) or
until dismissed by the Adept, either by choice or by the Adept leaving
the vicinity of the spirit (100 ft or so).  The target will remember
all seen, heard, smelt, etc from the summoning as if they had actually
been there in person.

The target's body will, at the exact time the spirit is summoned,
slump to the ground comatose.  It will have a living aura, but no
sentience will be present, just the body's autonomous functions.  The
body gains or loses no fatigue while in this coma, unless healed /
harmed in some way.  If the body is killed the spirit is immediately
returned to it (N.B.\ if the body is on 0 EN it is possible that this
return of the spirit may ``kickstart'' the body into life).  Otherwise
the spirit is not in contact with its body and has no idea what is
happening to it.

The ritual has a Base Chance of 20\% plus 5\% per rank in the ritual
and 5\% per Individual True Name Rank.  If the ritual works, but
nothing happens the Adept will know either the entity resisted, the
entity is out of range, the entity is dead or the the wrong name has
been used.  Backfire is possible, with spell reversal probably
entailing travel to the being being summoned.

All living beings in the DragonQuest world have a Generic True Name
and aura.  Formerly living things retain their name and traces of
their aura.  This name is in an ancient language, and the translation
into the common tongue would yield such terms as man, elf, tiger, oak,
bee, rattlesnake, rose, etc.  All such names when uttered in their
ancient form by a Namer give the Namer power to control the entity,
and these Generic Names are taught to an apprentice Namer during the
Namer's training (the usual names known are listed on a separate sheet
as the Namer Names List).  This familiarity with an ancient spoken
language allows Namers to Rank the Skill Spoken Languages at half
normal experience cost to Rank 5 for all ancient languages attempted.
Namers may learn a Generic True Name they are not familiar with by
d26 4
a29 2
\begin{itemize}
\item Encountering the entity to which the Name refers.
d31 1
a31 8
\end{itemize}

The encounter method requires no explicit action and no time is taken.
Formerly living objects will only reveal their Generic Name to a Namer
in this manner if they are in a recognisable form (for example the
head of lion would reveal its Generic Name but not a leg or an ear).

Given Name will be in the entity's native tongue (thus the Namer must
spend time translating the Individual Name into the Namer language
before it could be used).  When an individual is born their Individual
True Name becomes known to the Naming Demons (see the demon
d87 9
a95 8
trained to recognize, but other Colleges, through use of the same
Detect Aura spell/talent, would need to inquire of.  The Individual
True Name is also coded into the aura, but is so complex and varied
that they cannot be deciphered and used by even a Namer.  If the Namer
is given the Entity's True Name, then it is possible for the Namer to
identify the auric characteristics that make up the Individual True
Name.  The study of these components takes considerable time due to
their complexity.

Ritual Spell Preparation (see \S\ref{magic:) except that he must cast the
appropriate counterspell in order to accomplish the dissipation of the
spell.  In order to perform this ritual, the Namer must know the exact
name of the spell that was cast over the character or object, what
College the spell was a part of, and whether or not the spell was a
General or Special Knowledge spell.  Only spells (not rituals) may be
dissipated using this technique.  Only Namers may use counterspells to
dissipate spells once they have been cast, due to their superior
knowledge of the nature and characteristics of auras.  Adepts of other
Colleges may use counterspells to send entities which they have
personally summoned back to their own dimensions.  In such cases, the
counterspell need not be cast as part of a ritual.  Only Namers,
however, may dispel magic by using this ritual.  At least 1 hour must
be spent implementing this ritual.  The Namer may not simply cast a
counterspell over a character or object to achieve the same effect.
Characters may never achieve Rank with this ritual, though the
specific counterspell used may be ranked.

1 / Rank) feet during the ritual which lasts 1 hour.  At the end of
the ritual, the Namer's player makes a Cast Check to determine if the
ritual has had the desired effect.  The Base Chance for this check is
40\%.  The Base Chance is modified by the addition of 10 for each Rank
the Namer has in the use of this ritual.  There is no possibility of
backfire from this ritual.

however.  An entity will be called by his Given (or Use) Name, which
is given to him by his parents.  The Individual True Name and the Given
Name will be in the entity's native tongue (thus the Namer must spend
time translating the Individual Name into the Namer language before it
could be used).  When an individual is born their Individual True Name
becomes known to the Naming Demons (see the demon descriptions in the
College of Greater Summoning).  Namers know only their own Individual
True Name upon completing their education.  All other Individual
True Names must be acquired and learnt before they can be used.  Three

General Knowledge of each Namer when he completes his apprenticeship.
They are known at Rank 0.  They do not count against the number of
spells and rituals a Namer may know unless and until Ranked.  A Namer
may know a number of spells and rituals (other than counterspells) of
Rank 5 or lower and a number of counterspells of Ranks 1 to 5 equal to
his Magical Aptitude.  For example, a character could know 3 spells of
Rank 5 or less and 12 counterspells of Rank 1 through 5 if he had a
Magical Aptitude of 15 (or any combination of spells, counterspells
and rituals equal to 15).  The use of counterspells is described in
section (\S \ref{counterspells}).
