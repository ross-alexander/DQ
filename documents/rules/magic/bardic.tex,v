@\begin{college}[2.1]{bardic}{Bardic Magics}{BA}

The College of Bardic Magic deals primarily with sound, language,
rhythm, and the power in music; particularly the power to soothe,
charm, and otherwise affect emotions. Adepts of this College are
generally known as Bards.  Many Bards are employed as court musicians,
though a number exercise their art as sole practitioners, wandering
the highways and byways of the land.

Almost all Bards have performance skills, often highly ranked.
Alongside this they often have the Spy skill which is complemented by
certain of the magics of this College. It is not unknown for Bards to
pass themselves off as simple musicians or entertainers in order to
infiltrate unfriendly courts. It is this fact, and the consequently
secretive nature of this College which has lead to its relative
obscurity.

The principal difference between this college and all others is that
the spell's verbal component is usually sung, instead of spoken.
Furthermore, because a musical instrument may be used to enhance the
effect, Bardic spells have little or no somatic component. It is
almost impossible for a Bard to cast quietly.

\subsubsection{Traditional Colours}

Bards usually wear an item of a particular shade of deep blue,
sometimes known as Harper Blue, somewhere on their person.  Otherwise
they tend to dress to the occasion.

\subsubsection{Traditional Symbols}

The symbol of the Bardic College is a golden harp. This may be worn as
a brooch or amulet or embossed on the Bard's instrument if
appropriate.

\subsection{Restrictions}

Adepts of the College of Bardic Magics can only practise their art in
a region where sound can be heard. It is not possible to practise
Bardic magic in a location where sound is silenced, magically or
otherwise. Bardic magic may be practised underwater, but the results
may vary somewhat from those expected.

The MA requirement for this College is 16.

\subsection{Base Chance Modifiers}

The following numbers are added to the Base Chance of performing any
talent, spell or ritual of the College of Bardic Magics:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
For each Rank of Troubadour (Singing)	&	+1 \\
(This bonus is only applicable when spell is sung)\\
Area is acoustically excellent		&	+5 \\
Area deadens sound			&	-5 \\
\end{tabularx}

All modifiers are cumulative. 

\subsection{Talents}

\begin{talent}[T-1]{Concealed Casting}

\multiple{150}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to conceal the casting of a spell within the words
of a mundane song. If an observer is listening intently the observer
may make a (2 \x PC - Rank) check to notice. The bard may not make any
movements which are inappropriate to the song being sung.  All aspects
of the spell (including Base Chance) must be cast at the lower of this
talent and the spell's Rank and the Base Chance is further reduced by
20\%.  This Talent only functions with spells of the Bardic College.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-2]{Enhanced Hearing}

\multiple{75}
\begin{effects}
The Adept is able to hear sounds too faint to be heard normally.  The
Rank of this talent should be added to the Adept's perception for the
purposes of detecting sounds only. This talent can be activated and
deactivated at will, and the Adept may be temporarily deafened by loud
noises while it is activated.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-3]{Melodic Memory}

\multiple{75}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can attempt to commit to memory any sounds that they can
hear. The Adept must concentrate to activate this talent, and the
Adept's player should represent this by taking down key words and
phrases. By means of this talent the Adept can memorise music, dramas,
dialogue etc. even if they cannot understand them. The Adept's chance
of success to recall the sounds is 2 \x PC (+ 5 / Rank) - 5 / week
since the sounds were heard. If the Adept rolls above their Base
Chance the higher the roll the greater the degree of error.
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\begin{talent}[T-4]{Project Voice}

\multiple{75}
\begin{effects}
The talent allows the Adept to project their voice so that it may be
heard clearly everywhere within 25 feet (+ 25 / Rank).
\end{effects}
\end{talent}

\subsection{General Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[G-1]{Clairaudience}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates an invisible, intangible ear that can be moved about
within the spell's range.  The ear appears in the same hex as the
Bard, and operates as a normal ear except that it is not physically
attached to the Bard. The Adept may move the ear at a TMR of up to the
Rank of the spell, taking pass actions to do so. The ear may be
detected by Witchsight or similar means of detection. If the ear takes
any magical damage (it may be struck by a magical weapon) it is
destroyed and the Adept is stunned. It cannot be used to target
spells. In the area of a Confusion of Tongues spell the Adept will
only hear meaningless jumbled words. Clairaudience will not penetrate
the volume of a Shell of Silence spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-2]{Enchant Instrument}

\range{Touch}

\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Musical Instrument}
\begin{effects}
With this spell the Adept draws on the resonance left in an instrument
from it having been played. The spell enchants one musical instruments
so that a being may play it at an effective Troubadour Rank equal to 0
+ (1 / 3 or fraction ranks), whether or not they know how to play that
form of instrument. This Rank may not exceed the maximum Rank the
instrument being targeted has previously been played at.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-3]{Ethereal Orchestra}

\range{25 feet + 25 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
Creates magical accompaniment for the Adept's performance. The
accompaniment consists of the sounds of one instrument plus one per
three full ranks. The Adept must be familiar with music made by their
chosen instruments, but need not be able to play the instruments
themself. This accompaniment increases the effective Rank of the
performance by 1 (+ 1 / 5 Ranks) without bestowing new skills, or
affecting quasi-magical abilities or base chances. The maximum volume
generated may not exceed that of loud chanting, and the accompaniment
can be heard clearly everywhere within the range of the spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-4]{Exhortation}

\range{25 feet + 25 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
By means of this spell the Adept may attempt to affect the mood of a
crowd, inciting a riot or calming a mob. The reaction roll of the
crowd is modified by +5\% ( + 1 / Rank). Once the Adept ceases to play
and/or sing, the spell ceases to be in effect, but the effects may
continue as determined by the GM.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-5]{Quietness}

\range{1 foot + 1 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes  + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{30\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion, Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The sounds of the target's movement are partially deadened.  The
effect of this is to add 5\% (+ 1 / Rank) to Stealth.  Any Entity
attempting to cast Bardic magic while under the effect of this spell
suffers a 5 penalty to their Base Chance due to the deadening of
sound.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-6]{Mockery}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{20\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Sentient Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept sings or orates a song or poem, detailing the target's
shortcomings and inflicting general abuse, insults and mockery. A
target that fails to resist may be embarrassed, shocked, humiliated,
indignant or infuriated as appropriate to their personality.  Whatever
the emotional effect, the character is distracted, and may do nothing
other than attempt to silence the Adept (by whatever means they wish)
or take pass actions for the duration of the spell.  A check of 1 \x
WP may be made at the end of the pulse following the pulse in which
the spell is cast and every pulse thereafter. Once the target
successfully makes a check the spell ends. The target must be able to
hear and understand the Adept in order for the spell to have any
effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-7]{Shatter}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The Adept shrieks in an unnatural and piercing fashion, creating
ethereal dissonance that can destroy objects. The Adept may affect an
object of no more than 0.5 pounds (+ 0.5 / Rank).  Additionally, the
Rank of this spell determines what material may be destroyed:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Rank}	& \textbf{Material} \\
0--3		& glass, mirror \\
4--6		& ceramics \\
7--9		& crystals \\
10--12		& stone \\
13--14		& gems \\
15--16		& bone or ivory \\
17--18		& hard metal (iron) \\
19--20		& soft metal (bronze)  \\		
\end{tabular}

Note that the base MR of objects is 0. Crafted objects and those made
of precious materials receive bonuses to their resistance rolls, as
detailed below. Shaped magical items are immune to the effects of this
spell.  Possessions have their owners MR. These bonuses are
cumulative.  Crafting modifier: 2 \x Artisan Rank; Material Modifiers:
Silver +5\%, Gold +10\%, Truesilver +15\%, Precious gems, etc.\
+20\%. The GM should only apply the modifier of the material that
makes up the majority of the object.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}


\begin{spell}[G-8]{Silent Sounds}

\range{Touch}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 minutes / Rank}
\multiple{100}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Object}
\begin{effects}
The target object generates sounds which are almost inaudible, but
affect living entities within 5 feet (+ 5 / Rank) rendering them
either: edgy, and more susceptible to fear and awe; or tranquil, and
less prone to fear and awe. Affected beings either add or subtract 1
(+ 1 / Rank) to rolls made on the fright or awe tables as appropriate.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-9]{Soothe the Savage Beast}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: no maximum}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Passive}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept plays or sings soothing music which causes any living non
sentient entities within or entering the area of effect to resist or
be pacified. Animals that do not resist must make a check against 2 \x
WP - Rank of Spell to attack the Adept, and a check against 2 \x WP to
initiate any attack whilst in the area. The creature's reaction roll
is increased by 10\% (+ 2 / Rank), but the reaction roll may not be
made to exceed 95 by the effects of this spell. If any soothed entity
is attacked, or the Adept ceases to play and/or sing, the spell ceases
to be in effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-10]{Speaking Beasts}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{35\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Animal}
\begin{effects}
This spell confers any one language known to the Adept at Rank 6 or
greater, upon an animal (beast, avian, or aquatic; any non-sentient
able to vocalise sounds) for the duration of the spell, at a language
Rank equal to 1 (+ 1 / 5 Ranks).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[G-11]{Ventriloquism}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{5 minutes + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{40\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept may project their voice so that it appears to be emanating
from anywhere within the range of the spell. Also, it may be altered
so that it sounds like any other voice or voices the Adept has heard
and memorised with the Melodic Memory talent. For every five complete
ranks the Adept can project an extra simultaneous and independent
voice.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\subsection{General Knowledge Rituals}

\begin{ritual}[Q-1]{Implanting Sounds}

\range{10 feet + 10 / Rank}
\duration{1 week + 1 / Rank; Permanent at Rank 20}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{20\% + 4\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Object or Area}
\casttime{1 hour}
\actions{Perform song or sounds}
\concentration{None}
\begin{effects}
This ritual creates a type of ward, implanting a sequence of sounds
(which may be words, spoken or sung) of up to 10 seconds (+ 10 / Rank)
duration into an object or area. The Adept may determine the
triggering conditions, in the same way as a ward.  Additionally,
sounds implanted into an object may have a range of ``Touch'' thus
being triggered by a tactile cue, usually simply the object being
touched. The sound will be emitted each time the triggering conditions
are met, up to a maximum of 1 (+ 1 / Rank) times. The volume of the
sound produced may not exceed that of loud ringing bells. The ritual
dissapates at the end of its duration or if the Bardic General
Knowledge counterspell is cast on the target.  If the ritual backfires
the sounds are triggered immediately and will repeat Rank times, or
until counterspelled.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\begin{ritual}[Q-2]{Recitation}

\range{Touch}
\duration{Special}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\% + 4\% / Rank}
\resist{None}
\target{Object, Area or Entity}
\casttime{1 hour}
\actions{None}
\concentration{Standard}
\begin{effects}
At the completion of this ritual the Adept will enter a trance, during
which they will recite a legend or story relating to their current
location, to an object held in their hands, or to an entity they are
touching. If no such story exists, or the ritual fails, then the Adept
will recite some amusing but trivial song. If the ritual backfires the
legend will be false. The amount of information received is related to
the Bard's Rank with this ritual. If the GM prefers this may be played
as obtaining an answer to 3 (+1/3 ranks) short questions related to
the location, object or entity which will be answered in ``legendary''
terms. This ritual may not be repeated on a given target more than
once per season.
\end{effects}
\end{ritual}

\subsection{Special Knowledge Spells}

\begin{spell}[S-1]{Charming}

\range{50 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{1 hour + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{400}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept can influence the actions of an entity who fails to resist,
provided that the target can hear and understand the Adept. The target
will see the Adept as their true friend and will readily accept most
suggestions emanating from them. Sworn enemies of the Adept (or of
their race) will not be affected by this spell. Any suggestion that is
not directly and obviously inimical to the target's interests (as
defined by the GM, but usually limited to actions that would be
injurious or fatal) will be acted upon 90\% of the time. The Adept may
only ensure 100\% compliance with a request by making it an order in
which case the target makes an immediate Resistance Check.  Any
suggestion that would lead to the target's injury or death results in
an immediate Resistance Check. If successful the spell is broken.
Otherwise, the target accepts the order and will carry it out
faithfully for the duration of the spell.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-2]{Compel Speech}

\range{Touch}
\duration{1 minute + 1 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The target entity must resist, or be compelled to speak continuously
on random subjects. Should anyone put a question to the entity they
must make a 3 \x WP - Spell Rank check or speak to the question. The
entity is not compelled to speak the truth by this spell, or any
particular language, and may cast spells.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-3]{Comprehending Tongues}

\range{Self}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
Enables the Adept to speak and understand one language at a Rank equal
to 1 (+ 1 / 4 Ranks). The Adept must have heard the language that they
wish to speak. The language may be nominated by name, or by choosing
to speak a language that the Adept has memorised some words and
phrases from using the Talent of Melodic Memory. This spell allows the
Adept to be understood, but confers no other bonuses.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-4]{Confusion of Tongues}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{350}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
All entities within the radius of effect of the spell who fail to
resist become unable to communicate in, or understand any verbal
language whilst within the affected area. The affected area is a
circle with a radius of 5 feet (+ 5 / Rank). Affected entities may not
use the Military Scientist ``time out'' ability.  They can cast spells
and trigger items, but if casting, the backfire threshold (\ie +30 or
+40) is decreased by 5\% (+ 1 / Rank).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-5]{Dance of Swords}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{30 minutes + 30 / Rank}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Potion}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
While under the effect of this spell, the target may cavort and leap
with surpassing grace and extravagance by evoking the magic of the
dance. The target may walk and act in all ways normally, however, when
they enter combat they may ``dance'' adding 2 (+2 / Rank) to their
Defence provided they move at least 1 hex each pulse. If the target is
unwillingly confined to a single hex (by the effect of melee zones for
example) the target must halve the defence bonus due to this spell. If
the target is unable to move freely (in close combat or stunned) then
no defence bonus is awarded. The target may also subtract the Rank of
this spell from the dice roll for any AG Check solely involving
Agility (\eg avoid knockdown, leaping pits etc.).
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-6]{Enthralling Audience}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Special}
\storage{Invested, Ward}
\target{Sentient living entities}
\begin{effects}
All entities who willingly listen to the song sung by the Adept will
perceive a succession of evocative images which illustrate the song
being sung. These images are hallucinatory in nature, having no
external reality, but are seen by the audience. No resistance check
needs to be made by those who do not submit willingly to the effects
of the spell, but they will not perceive the images.  Those who submit
to the effects will be enthralled by the images and may take no other
action, unless and until their concentration is broken by physical
contact with an external entity or force. The Adept must continue to
sing throughout the duration.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-7]{Shout of Thunder}

\range{15 feet + 15 / Rank}
\duration{Immediate}
\multiple{250}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Entity}
\begin{effects}
The Adept projects a thunderous shout of rage at the target. If the
target fails to resist it suffers [D - 5] (+ 1 / Rank) damage and is
automatically stunned. The target will also be deafened for [D - 5] (+
1 / 2 Ranks) minutes and will have a very nasty headache which will
make concentration one level more difficult until it wears off or is
cured by a healer. There is a chance equal to 5\% + 1 / Rank that this
deafness will be permanent until cured by the arts of a Healer of Rank
4 or greater, or by the Ritual of Cure Deafness and Muteness. The
sound is clearly audible in the area surrounding the target.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-8]{Inspirational Song}

\range{15 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{20 seconds + 5 / Rank}
\multiple{300}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{None}
\target{Sentient Entities}
\begin{effects}
The Adept sings a song of inspiration mentioning the name of each
target. The spell will effect 1 target (+ 1/3 or fraction Ranks) who
each gain 1 (+ 1/2 Ranks) to their Strike Chances, and 1 (+ 1 / Rank)
to Fear Resistance rolls and Rally Chances. Targets must be able to
hear and understand the Bard. The Adept must sing or orate for the
entire duration of the spell, or the effect ceases. The Adept may
perform other actions as long as they have no vocal requirement.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-9]{Satyr's Dance}

\range{5 feet + 5 / Rank}
\duration{Concentration: Maximum 10 seconds + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{450}
\basechance{10\%}
\resist{Active, Passive}
\storage{Potion}
\target{Self}
\begin{effects}
The Adept sings and dances in a hypnotic pattern, entrancing all in
range who fail to resist, and forcing them to join in the dance. All
dancers (including the Adept) may move at 1/2 TMR (round up), but are
unable to take any other action. The area of effect moves with the
Adept and all victims will attempt to stay within range. Any entity
that enters the area of effect must resist or suffer the same fate.
The Adept must be seen and heard for a target to be effected.  Victims
of this song get an additional resistance roll every pulse that they
are attacked or restrained, or somehow prevented from being within the
area of effect.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-10]{Shell of Silence}

\range{10 feet + 1 / Rank}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{150}
\basechance{15\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Investment, Ward, Magical Trap}
\target{Area}
\begin{effects}
The Adept creates an invisible spherical shell with a diameter equal
to 15 feet (+ 5 feet for every 5 Ranks). Sound created within this
shell is totally inaudible to entities outside the shell and vice
versa.  A Clairaudience spell projected from outside the shell cannot
penetrate it.
\end{effects}
\end{spell}

\begin{spell}[S-11]{Silver Tongue}

\range{Self}
\duration{10 minutes + 10 / Rank}
\multiple{200}
\basechance{25\%}
\resist{None}
\storage{Potion}

\begin{effects}
Everything that the Adept says becomes more convincing and believable.
This ability does not force listeners to believe the Adept, and
obvious lies where there is evidence to the contrary will be quickly
dismissed. But in the absence of such evidence, or when the lie is not
blatant, listeners will tend to take the Adept at their word. All
natural or magical abilities that are normally able to determine
whether the Adept is lying or telling the truth suffer a negative
modifier to their Base Chance of 20\% (+ 5 / Rank). Those abilities
that always work or have no BC may be presumed to have a BC of 100\%
for these purposes. In addition, no magical ability is able to coerce
the Adept to speak truthfully.

\begin{effects}
All entities within the range of the spell and able to hear the Adept,

be unable to carry out any action that might harm the Adept. However,
if the Adept carries out any hostile action towards an entity or the
entity is rendered no longer able to hear, that entity will be
released from the spell. The Adept must continue to sing for the

The Adept plays a song that affects one willing entity (+ 1 / 3 or

affected targets fall asleep in 4 minutes (- 10 seconds / Rank,
minimum of 30 seconds).  The targets will remain asleep until
disturbed or they awaken normally. The resulting sleep is healing and
refreshing allowing the targets to regain 1 (+ 1 / 5 full Ranks) more

\begin{effects}
The Adept whispers a message consisting of no more than 5 words (+ 5 /

Adept, taking D10 + (distance travelled / 100) hours. The recipient's
surroundings (such as trees, waves or wind) whisper the message to the
recipient. There is a once times perception chance that any Bard
engaged in concentration will ``overhear'' a whisper which passes by
their location.

The Adept marches around the structure, within earshot of the walls,
playing a musical instrument. The music must be able to be clearly
heard at the structure. The size of structure which may be encompassed
is 50 feet (+ 50 / Rank) in diameter. The structure begins to shake
and vibrate, and at the end of the ritual, if it is successful, the
structure falls apart.  The Adept must walk slowly (1 mph) around the
target until they have completely encircled the target at least once,
and have marched for at least an hour.

\begin{effects}
The Adept nominates one type of non-sentient entity which normally
forms swarms, packs or herds (\eg rats, locusts, wolves, elephants) at
the start of this ritual. The size of the entity which can be affected
is dependent on Rank: Rank 0--5, entities less than 1lb in weight can
be affected; Rank 6--10, entities less than 10lb; Rank 11--15,
entities less than 100 lb; Rank 16 and above, entities greater than
100lb. The Adept then begins to play a tune which has a compelling
effect on all entities of the target type. The area of effect moves
with the Adept, and as they play and walk, all of these entities
within range will begin to follow the Adept, growing into a horde. At
the end of at least 1 hour the Adept gives a single command to the
horde. The wording of this command may not exceed 1 word (+ 1/3 or
fraction Ranks). The command will be obeyed for a period of 1 hour (+1

 The Adept is able to hear sounds too faint to be heard
normally.  The Rank of this talent should be added to the Adept's
perception for the purposes of detecting sounds only. This talent can
be activated and deactivated at will, and the Adept may be temporarily
deafened by loud noises while it is activated.

a99 8
 The Adept can attempt to commit to memory any sounds
that they can hear. The Adept must concentrate to activate this
talent, and the Adept's player should represent this by taking down
key words and phrases. By means of this talent the Adept can memorise
music, dramas, dialogue etc. even if they cannot understand them. The
Adept's chance of success to recall the sounds is 2 \x PC (+ 5 / Rank)
- 5 / week since the sounds were heard. If the Adept rolls above their
Base Chance the higher the roll the greater the degree of error.

 The Adept creates an invisible, intangible ear that can
be moved about within the spell's range.  The ear appears in the same
hex as the Bard, and operates as a normal ear except that it is not
physically attached to the Bard. The Adept may move the ear at a TMR
of up to the Rank of the spell, taking pass actions to do so. The ear
may be detected by Witchsight or similar means of detection. If the
ear takes any magical damage (it may be struck by a magical weapon) it
is destroyed and the Adept is stunned. It cannot be used to target

 With this spell the Adept draws on the resonance left
in an instrument from it having been played. The spell enchants one
musical instruments so that a being may play it at an effective
Troubadour Rank equal to 0 + (1 / 3 or fraction ranks), whether or not
they know how to play that form of instrument. This Rank may not
exceed the maximum Rank the instrument being targeted has previously
been played at.

 Creates magical accompaniment for the Adept's
performance. The accompaniment consists of the sounds of one
instrument plus one per three full ranks. The Adept must be familiar
with music made by their chosen instruments, but need not be able to
play the instruments themself. This accompaniment increases the
effective Rank of the performance by 1 (+ 1 / 5 Ranks) without
bestowing new skills, or affecting quasi-magical abilities or base
chances. The maximum volume generated may not exceed that of loud
chanting, and the accompaniment can be heard clearly everywhere within
the range of the spell.

 By means of this spell the Adept may attempt to affect
the mood of a crowd, inciting a riot or calming a mob. The reaction
roll of the crowd is modified by +5\% ( + 1 / Rank). Once the Adept
ceases to play and/or sing, the spell ceases to be in effect, but the
effects may continue as determined by the GM.

 The sounds of the target's movement are partially
deadened.  The effect of this is to add 5\% (+ 1 / Rank) to Stealth.
Any Entity attempting to cast Bardic magic while under the effect of
this spell suffers a 5 penalty to their Base Chance due to the
deadening of sound.

 The Adept sings or orates a song or poem, detailing the
target's shortcomings and inflicting general abuse, insults and
mockery. A target that fails to resist may be embarrassed, shocked,
humiliated, indignant or infuriated as appropriate to their
personality.  Whatever the emotional effect, the character is
distracted, and may do nothing other than attempt to silence the Adept
(by whatever means they wish) or take pass actions for the duration of
the spell.  A check of 1 \x WP may be made at the end of the pulse
following the pulse in which the spell is cast and every pulse
thereafter. Once the target successfully makes a check the spell
ends. The target must be able to hear and understand the Adept in
order for the spell to have any effect.

 The Adept shrieks in an unnatural and piercing fashion,
creating ethereal dissonance that can destroy objects. The Adept may
affect an object of no more than 0.5 pounds (+ 0.5 / Rank).
Additionally, the Rank of this spell determines what material may be
destroyed:

 The target object generates sounds which are almost
inaudible, but affect living entities within 5 feet (+ 5 / Rank)
rendering them either: edgy, and more susceptible to fear and awe; or
tranquil, and less prone to fear and awe. Affected beings either add
or subtract 1 (+ 1 / Rank) to rolls made on the fright or awe tables as
appropriate.

 The Adept may project their voice so that it appears to
be emanating from anywhere within the range of the spell. Also, it may
be altered so that it sounds like any other voice or voices the Adept
has heard and memorised with the Melodic Memory talent. For every five
complete ranks the Adept can project an extra simultaneous and
independent voice.

 The Adept can influence the actions of an entity who
fails to resist, provided that the target can hear and understand the
Adept. The target will see the Adept as their true friend and will
readily accept most suggestions emanating from them. Sworn enemies of
the Adept (or of their race) will not be affected by this spell. Any
suggestion that is not directly and obviously inimical to the target's
interests (as defined by the GM, but usually limited to actions that
would be injurious or fatal) will be acted upon 90\% of the time. The
Adept may only ensure 100\% compliance with a request by making it an
order in which case the target makes an immediate Resistance Check.
Any suggestion that would lead to the target's injury or death results
in an immediate Resistance Check. If successful the spell is broken.

 The target entity must resist, or be compelled to speak
continuously on random subjects. Should anyone put a question to the
entity they must make a 3 \x WP - Spell Rank check or speak to the
question. The entity is not compelled to speak the truth by this
spell, or any particular language, and may cast spells.

d469 6
a474 7
 Enables the Adept to speak and understand one language
at a Rank equal to 1 + 1/4 Ranks with this spell. The Adept must have
heard the language that they wish to speak. The language may be
nominated by name, or by choosing to speak a language that the Adept
has memorised some words and phrases from using the Talent of Melodic
Memory. This spell allows the Adept to be understood, but confers no
other bonuses.

 All entities within the radius of effect of the spell
who fail to resist become unable to communicate in, or understand any
verbal language whilst within the affected area. The affected area is
a circle with a radius of 5 feet (+ 5 / Rank). Affected entities may
not use the Military Scientist ``time out'' ability.  They can cast
spells and trigger items, but if casting, the backfire threshold
(\ie +30 or +40) is decreased by 5\% (+ 1 / Rank).

 All entities who willingly listen to the song sung by
the Adept will perceive a succession of evocative images which
illustrate the song being sung. These images are hallucinatory in
nature, having no external reality, but are seen by the audience. No
resistance check needs to be made by those who do not submit willingly
to the effects of the spell, but they will not perceive the images.
Those who submit to the effects will be enthralled by the images and
may take no other action, unless and until their concentration is
broken by physical contact with an external entity or force. The Adept
must continue to sing throughout the duration.

 The Adept is able to conceal the casting of a spell
within the words of a mundane song. If an observer is listening
intently the observer may make a (2 \x PC - Rank) check to notice. The
bard may not make any movements which are inappropriate to the song
being sung.  All aspects of the spell (including Base Chance) must be
cast at the lower of this talent and the spell's Rank and the Base

 This ritual creates a type of ward, implanting a
sequence of sounds (which may be words, spoken or sung) of up to 10
seconds (+10 / Rank) duration into an object or area. The Adept may
determine the triggering conditions, in the same way as a ward.
Additionally, sounds implanted into an object may have a range of
``Touch'' thus being triggered by a tactile cue, usually simply the
object being touched. The sound will be emitted each time the
triggering conditions are met, up to a maximum of 1 (+ 1 / Rank)
times. The volume of the sound produced may not exceed that of loud
ringing bells. The ritual dissapates at the end of its duration or if
the Bardic General Knowledge counterspell is cast on the target.  If
the ritual backfires the sounds are triggered immediately and will
repeat Rank times, or until counterspelled.

 The Adept nominates one type of non-sentient entity
which normally forms swarms, packs or herds (\eg rats, locusts,
wolves, elephants) at the start of this ritual. The size of the entity
which can be affected is dependent on Rank: Rank 0--5, entities less
than 1lb in weight can be affected; Rank 6--10, entities less than
10lb; Rank 11--15, entities less than 100 lb; Rank 16 and above,
entities greater than 100lb. The Adept then begins to play a tune
which has a compelling effect on all entities of the target type. The
area of effect moves with the Adept, and as they play and walk, all of
these entities within range will begin to follow the Adept, growing
into a horde. At the end of at least 1 hour the Adept gives a single

 At the completion of this ritual the Adept will enter a

their current location, to an object held in their hands, or to an
entity they are touching. If no such story exists, or the ritual fails
then the Adept will recite some amusing but trivial song. If the
ritual backfires the legend will be false. The amount of information
received is related to the Bard's Rank with this ritual. If the GM
prefers this may be played as obtaining an answer to 3 (+1/3 ranks)
short questions related to the location, object or entity which will
be answered in ``legendary'' terms. This ritual may not be repeated on

to resist or be pacified. Animals that do not resist must make a check

within range. Any entity that enters the area of effect must resist or
suffer the same fate. The Adept must be seen and heard for a target to
be effected. Victims of this song get an additional resistance roll
every pulse that they are attacked or restrained, or somehow prevented
from being within the area of effect.
d627 5

 The Adept creates an invisible spherical shell with a
diameter equal to 15 feet (+ 5 feet for every 5 Ranks). Sound created
within this shell is totally inaudible to entities outside the shell
and vice versa.  A Clairaudience spell projected from outside the
shell cannot penetrate it.
d645 11
a655 11
 Everything that the Adept says becomes more convincing
and believable. This ability does not force listeners to believe the
Adept, and obvious lies where there is evidence to the contrary will
be quickly dismissed. But in the absence of such evidence, or when the
lie is not blatant, listeners will tend to take the Adept at their
word. All natural or magical abilities that are normally able to
determine whether the Adept is lying or telling the truth suffer a
negative modifier to their Base Chance of 20\% (+ 5 / Rank). Those
abilities that always work or have no BC may be presumed to have a BC
of 100\% for these purposes. In addition, no magical ability is able
to coerce the Adept to speak truthfully.

\textbf{This College is a probationary College. This means that this
College is under trial for two years (as of June 1997). All characters
that join this College do so under the understanding that if this
College is deemed unplayable, it may be withdrawn or radically
changed. At that point, all such characters may have the EP and time
spent in this College refunded, to be re-spent freely in another
College as if that College had been their original choice.}

\emph{Effect:} While under the effect of this spell, the target may
cavort and leap with surpassing grace and extravagance by evoking the
magic of the dance. The target may walk and act in all ways normally,
however, when they enter combat they may ``dance'' adding 2 (+2 /
Rank) to their Defence provided they move at least 1 hex each
round. If the target is unwillingly confined to a single hex (by the
effect of melee zones for example) the target must halve the defence
bonus due to this spell. If the target is unable to move freely (in
close combat or stunned) then no defence bonus is awarded. The target
may also subtract the Rank of this spell from the dice roll for any AG
Check solely involving Agility (\eg avoid knockdown, leaping pits
etc.).

\sItem{Target}{Self}
\sItem{Storage}{Potion}
\emph{Effect:} The Adept is able to sense sounds as they rebound from
objects.  These sounds must be generated by the Adept by physical
means, either vocally, or by means of an instrument. Using this spell
the Adept can ``see'' even in total darkness (such as a Rank 20
magical Darkness), or with eyes shut or blinded. However, Echosense
is not sight. Images are unclear and blurred, and recognition is
difficult, especially at low Ranks, and whilst it is possible to
target spells using Echosense, the Adept may not be able to tell
friend from foe. The range of the Echosense is 30 feet (+ 5 / Rank).

\emph{Effect:} The Adept projects a greatly amplified shout of rage at
the target. If the target fails to resist it is automatically stunned
for [D-5] (+ 1/2 Ranks) pulses and may not attempt to recover from
stun until this time has elapsed. The target is also deafened for a
like number of minutes and will have a very nasty headache which will
make concentration 1 level more difficult until the deafness wears off
or is cured by a healer.  There is a chance equal to 5\% (+ 1 / Rank)
that this deafness will be permanent until cured by the arts of a
Healer of Rank 4 or greater, or by Ritual of Cure Deafness and
Muteness.

means of detection. If the ear takes any magical damage (it may be
struck by a magical weapon) it is destroyed and the Adept is

College is under trial for two years. All characters that join this
College do so under the understanding that if this College is deemed
unplayable, it may be withdrawn or radically changed. At that point,
all such characters may have the EP spent in this College refunded, to

their original choice.}

The College of Bardic Magic deals primarily with sound,
communication and musical effects. Adepts of this College are
generally known as Bards. Most Bards exercise their art as sole
practitioners, wandering the highways and byways of the land,
though a number may be employed as court musicians. 
d12 24
a35 20
Alongside this they often have the Spy skill which is
complemented by certain of the magics of this College. It is not
unknown for Bards to pass themselves off as simple musicians or
entertainers in order to infiltrate unfriendly courts. It is this
fact, and the consequently secretive nature of this College which
has lead to its relative obscurity.

The principal difference between this college and all others is
that the spell's verbal component is usually sung, instead of
spoken. Furthermore, because a musical instrument may be used to
enhance the effect, Bardic spells have little or no somatic
component. It is almost impossible for a Bard to cast quietly.

Traditional Colours: Bards usually wear a item of a particular
shade of deep blue, sometimes known as Harper Blue, somewhere on
their person. Otherwise they tend to dress to the occasion.

Traditional Symbols: The symbol of the Bardic College is a golden
harp. This may be worn as a brooch or amulet or embossed on the
Bard's instrument if appropriate.

The Adept is able to conceal the casting of a spell within the words
of a mundane song. If an observer is listening intently the observer
may a make (2 \x PC) - rank check to notice. The bard may not make any
movements which are inappropriate to the song being song.  All aspects
of the spell (including Base Chance) must be cast at the lower of this

The adept is able to hear sounds too faint to be heard normally.  The

The Adept can attempt to commit to memory any sounds that he can
hear. The Adept must concentrate to activate this talent, and the
Adept's player should represent this by taking down key words and
phrases. By means of this talent the Adept can memorize music, dramas,
dialogue etc. even if he cannot understand them. The adept's chance to
success to recall the sounds is 2 \x PC + 5/rank - 5/week since the
sounds were heard. The higher the roll the greater the degree of error
if the adept rolls above his Base Chance.

except that it is not physically attached to the Bard. The Adept
may move the ear at a TMR of up to the Rank of the spell, taking
pass actions to do so. The ear may be detected by Witchsight or
similar means of detection. If the ear takes any magical damage
(it may be struck by a magical weapon) it is destroyed and the
Adept is stunned. Cannot be used to target spells. In the area
of a Confusion of Tongues spell the Adept will only hear
meaningless jumbled words. Clairaudience will not penetrate the

The language may be nominated by name, or by nominating a target
sentient capable of communicating verbally, and wishing to speak
the language of that entity. This allows those spells that
require the Adept to be understood by a target to be effective.
This spell allows the Adept to be understood, but confers no
other bonuses. (It will not function in the area of a Confusion
of Tongues spell.)

This spell causes a song or poem to be heard by the target,
detailing the target's shortcomings and inflicting general abuse,
insults and mockery. A target that fails to resist may be
embarrassed, shocked, humiliated, indignant or infuriated as
appropriate to their personality. Whatever the emotional effect,
the character is distracted, and may only take pass actions for
the duration of the spell or until the target successfully makes
a check against 1 \x willpower. This check is made at the end of
the pulse following the pulse in which the spell is cast and
every pulse thereafter. The target must be able to understand the
Adept in order for the spell to have any effect. (It will not
work in the area of a Confusion of Tongues spell or on non-
sentients.)

If this spell is successfully cast the sounds of the target
entity's movement is partially deadened. The effect of this is
to add 5\% (+1\% per rank) to Stealth. Any entity attempting to
cast Bardic magic while under the effect of this spell suffers
a -5 penalty to their base chance due to the deadening of sound.

\end{spelldesc}

The Adept shrieks in an unnatural and piercing fashion, creating
ethereal dissonances that can destroy objects. The Adept may
affect an object of no more than 0.5 pounds (+0.5/Rank).
Additionally, the Rank of this spell determines what material may
be destroyed:
Rank 0-2  glass, mirror
     3-4  ceramics
     5-6  crystals
     7-8  stone
     9-10 gems
     11-12     bone or ivory

     15-16     soft metal (bronze)           
     17-20     wood

An object has the resistance of its possessor. If the object is
not in the possession of any entity, it has a base resistance of
zero. Crafted objects and those made of precious materials
receive bonuses to their resistance rolls, as detailed below.
Permanently magical items are immune to the effects of this
spell. These bonuses are cumulative.
     Crafting modifier:  2 \x Artisan Rank

pacified. Such entites must make a check against 1 \x willpower -
 rank of spell to attack the Adept, and a check against 2 x
willpower to attack the Adept's companions. The creature's
reaction roll is increased by 10\% + 2/rank, such that the

altered so that it sounds like any other voice or voices the
Adept has heard and memorized with the Melodic Memory talent at
a 10\% reduction in base chance. Other sounds may also be imitated
at appropriate reductions to base chance. The voice(s) may be
projected so that it appears to be emanating from anywhere within
range. For every five complete ranks the Adept can project an
extra simultaneous voice.

d368 14
a381 18

This ritual implants a sequence of sounds (which may be words,
spoken or sung) into an object or area. The Adept may determine
how it is triggered, based on a simple visual or aural cue, such
as an object being picked up, or a boundary being crossed. Sounds
implanted in an object are triggered by a tactile cue, usually
simply the object being touched. The sound will be emitted every
time the object or area is triggered, up to a number of times
equal to one + rank. The volume of the sound produced may not
exceed that of loud ringing of bells and may be heard at that
volume everywhere within the range. 
If a general knowledge counter-spell of this college is
successfully cast over the object or within the area the ritual
is dissipated. Otherwise it dissipates after a period of 1 week
+ 1 week/rank has passed. (At rank 20 the implanted sound is
permanent until dissipated). If the ritual backfires the sounds
are triggered immediately and will repeat rank times, or until
counter-spelled.

At the completion of this ritual the adept will enter a trance,
during which the adept will recite a legend or story relating to
the bard's current location, to an object held in the bard's
hands, or to an entity the Adept is touching. If no such story
exists, or the ritual fails then the adept will recite some
amusing but trivial song. If the ritual backfires the legend will
be false. The amount of information received is related to the
Bard's rank with this ritual. If the gamemaster prefers this may
be played as obtaining an answer to 3 (+1/3 ranks) short
questions related to the location, object or entity which will
be answered in "legendary" terms. This ritual may not be repeated
on a given target until a week has passed.

The Adept can influence the actions of an entity who fails to resist,
provided that the target can hear and understand the Bard. The target
will see the Adept as his true friend and will readily accept most
suggestions emanating from them. Any suggestion that is not directly
and obviously inimical to the target's interests (as defined by the
gamemaster, but usually limited to actions that would be injurious or
fatal) will be acted upon 90\% of the time. The Adept may only ensure
100\% compliance with a request by making it an order in which case
the target makes an immediate Resistance Check. Any suggestion that
would lead to the target's injury or death results in an immediate
Resistance Check. If successful the spell is broken.  Otherwise, the
target accepts the order and will carry it out faithfully for the
duration of the spell.

All entities within the radius of effect of the spell must
resist, or be unable to communicate in, or understand any
language for the duration of the spell. They cannot use Military
Scientist time out etc. They can cast spells and trigger items,
but the backfire chance is increased by 5\% + 1/Rank. The affected
area is equal to one hex + 1/Rank and must be contiguous.
Entities which leave the area are then able to communicate
normally. (See the ruling on Walls to check if they have to re-
resist if they re-enter the area of effect).

While under the effect of this spell, the target may cavort and leap
with surpassing grace and extravagance by evoking the magic of the
dance. The target may walk and act in all ways normally, however, when
they enter combat they may "dance" adding 2 (+2/Rank) to their Defence
provided they move at least 1 hex each round. If the target is
unwillingly confined to a single hex (by the effect of melee zones for
example) the target must halve the defence bonus due to this spell. If
the target is unable to move freely (in close combat or stunned) then
no defence bonus is awarded. The target may always subtract the Rank
of this spell from the dice roll for any Agility Check solely
involving Agility (eg. avoid knockdown, leaping pits etc).

The adept is enabled to sense sounds as they rebound from
objects. These sounds must be generated by the adept by physical
means, vocally, or by means of an instrument. Using this spell the
adept can "see" in total darkness (such as a Rank 20 magical
Darkness), even with eyes shut or blinded. However, echosense is not
sight. Images are unclear and blurred, and recognition is difficult,
especially at low rank. The range of echosense is 30ft + 5/rank.

being sung. These images are hallucinatory in nature, having no
external reality, but are seen by the audience. No resistance check
needs to be made by those who do not submit willingly to the effects
of the spell, but they will not perceive the images. Those who submit
to the effects will be enthralled by the images and may take no other
action, unless and until their concentration is broken by physical
contact with an external entity or force.

The Adept projects a greatly amplified shout of rage at the target
entity. If the entity fails to resist it is automatically stunned for
D-5 + 1/rank pulses and may not attempt to recover from stun until
this time has elapsed. The entity will also be deafened for D-4 +
1/rank minutes and will have a very nasty headache which will make
concentration one level more difficult until it wears off or is cured
by a healer. There is a chance equal to 5\% + 1/rank that this
deafness will be permanent until cured by the arts of a Healer of Rank
4 or greater, or by ritual

The Adept sings a song of inspiration mentioning the names of each of
his targets. He may effect 1 target (+1/3 or fraction Ranks) who each
may add 1 (+1/Rank) to their Strike Chances, Fear Resistance rolls and
Rally Chances. Targets must be able to hear and understand the
Bard. The Adept must sing or orate for the entire duration of the
spell, or the effect ceases. He may perform other actions as long as
they are not vocal (for example he may not attempt to cast another
spell).

attempt to stay within range. The Adept and victims may move at 1/2
TMR (Round Up). Any entity that moves into the area must resist or
suffer the same fate. The Adept must be seen or heard for a target to
be effected. Victims of this song get a Resistance roll every pulse

a class B weapon is increased by 1 for every 2 (or fraction) ranks the
caster has achieved in the spell. For class A and C weapons the damage
caused is increased by 1 for every 4 (or fraction) ranks the caster
has achieved in the spell.  Missile weapons are unaffected by this
spell. Any character attempting to strike a character wielding a
weapon of sound breaks his or her own weapon on a roll of 98 (- 1 for
every three complete ranks of the spell) instead of 99.

One entity + 1/rank, within the range of the spell and able to hear
the adept, must resist or feel a sudden affection for the adept. They
will then be unable to carry out any action that might harm the
adept. However, if the Adept carries out any hostile action towards an
entity or the entity is rendered no longer able to hear, that entity
will be released from the spell.  The adept must continue to sing for
the duration or the spell ceases to be in effect.

fraction ranks) causing them to drift into a normal sleep. All
affected targets fall asleep in 4 minutes (-10 seconds/Rank, minimum
of 30 seconds). Targets will remain asleep until disturbed or they
awaken normally. This enchantment may not be cast in combat. The

The Adept whispers a message consisting of no more than 5 words +
5/rank to their surroundings. The message travels at 100 miles per
hour to a recipient, who must be known to the Adept. The recipent's
surroundings (such as trees, waves or wind) whisper the message to the
recipient. There is a once times perception chance that a
concentrating Bard will "overhear" a whisper which passes by their
location.

\end{spelldesc}
The Adept marches around the structure, within earshot of the walls,
as the Adept playing a trumpet loudly. The size of structure which may
be encompassed should be no greater than 50ft + 50ft/rank in
diameter. At the end of the ritual if they successfully make their
cast check the structure falls apart. The Adept may only walk slowly
(1 mph) around the target until they have completely encircled the
target at least once, and have marched for at least an hour. If the
ritual Backfires the Adept must resist or be struck dumb (Minor
Curse).

d782 14
a795 15
The Adept nominates a type of non-sentient entity which normally forms
swarms, packs or herds (eg. rats, locusts) at the start of this
ritual. The size of the entity which can be affected is dependant on
rank. Up to rank 5 entities less than 1lb in weight can be affected,
between rank 5 and rank 10 entities less than 10lb, between rank 10
and rank 15, entities less than 100lb, at rank 16 and above entities
greater than 100lb. The Adept then begins to play a tune which has a
compelling effect on all entities of the target type. As the Adept
walks through the target area these entities come out and begin to
follow the Adept growing into a horde. At the end of an hour or more
of walking the Adept leads the horde out of the area, and then gives a
single command to the horde. The wording of this command may not
exceed 1 word + 1/3 full ranks. The command will be obeyed for a
period of 1 hour + 1 hour per rank.
