\begin{multicols}{2}
\subsection{Fright Table (Ver 1.0)}
\label{tables:fright}
\index{fear}\index{tables!fear}

\begin{description}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item[{\em Dice}] {\bf \em Result}

\item[$<$ 20\hspace{1.0em}Wary]
The target will not voluntarily approach the source of their fear.  If
they are not aware of the source they will be very cautious and seek
to optimise safety.

\item[21--25\hspace{1.0em}Berserk]
They immediately charge to attack the object of their rage.  If the
source is not apparent they will charge about noisily looking for it.
Add +10 to Strike Chance and -10 to Defence.

\item[26--75\hspace{1.0em}Panic]
They will attempt to maximise their safety in relation to the source
of their fear.  This usually involves fleeing as rapidly as possible,
but could also include cowering in the centre of the party, curling up
in a small ball, hiding under a bed, etc.  While a state of panic
prevails, some sanity is present and the target would not normally do
anything suicidal (\eg running over the edge of a cliff) but they
might use abilities to increase their safety (\eg flying away).  If
the target wishes to use an ability, (\eg casting a spell) the GM
should give a suitable negative modifier to their base chance
(\eg -20).

\item[76--90\hspace{1.0em}Frozen]
They may take no action until snapped out of it, \eg slapped on the
face, attacked, etc.  The target can attempt to break out of it
themselves by making a 1 \x WP check per pulse.  Once broken out of it
the target rolls again at -30 (and no other modifiers) to determine
their next action.  Add +10 to subsequent rolls on the fright table.

\item[91--95\hspace{1.0em}Hysterical]
They stand and scream and may take no other action until snapped out
of it (as for 76--90).  On recovery roll again at -20 (with no other
modifiers).  Add +10 to subsequent rolls on the fright table.

\item[96-100\hspace{1.0em}Catatonic]
Target becomes catatonic.  Their hair turns white and they may take no
other action until snapped out of it (as for 76--90).  On recovery
roll again at -20 (with no other modifiers).  Add +10 to subsequent
rolls on the fright table.

\item[101--110\hspace{1.0em}Faints]
The target faints into unconsciousness and loses 5 Fatigue.  At the
end of each minute they roll 1 \x WP in order to regain consciousness.
Add +10 to subsequent rolls on the fright table.

\item[111-115\hspace{1.0em}Collapses]
The target collapses into unconsciousness and loses all of their
Fatigue.  After (30 - Endurance) minutes, or being tended by a Healer,
they will regain consciousness.  All their Statistics and Ranks will
be reduced by 2, and they will not be able to recover Fatigue, until
they have had comfortable bed rest for (40 - Endurance - tending
Healer Rank) hours.  Add +10 to subsequent rolls on the fright table.

\item[116+\hspace{1.0em}Heart Attack]
The target suffers a heart attack and must receive the attention of a
Healer of at least Rank 3 within Endurance pulses or they are dead.
If they survive they will be on 0 Endurance and 0 Fatigue, and will be
unconsciousness for (30 - Endurance) minutes.  All their Statistics
and Ranks will be reduced by 5, and they will not be able to recover
Fatigue or more than half their Endurance, until they have had
comfortable bed rest for (60 - Endurance - tending Healer Rank) hours.
Add +10 to subsequent rolls on the fright table.

\end{description}

\subsection{Awe Table}
\label{tables:awe}
\index{awe}

\begin{description}

\item[01--20] Target is slightly awed.  Will not voluntarily approach
the source of the Awe, unless requested to do so by the source. If not
aware of the source, will be slightly cautious.

\item[21--25] Target is completely enamoured of the source.  Will do
anything that the source requests, to the extent of attacking comrades
and friends, but not to the extent of killing themself if so
requested.  If the source is not apparent they will rush around
noisily looking for it.

\item[26--76] Target is panicked by the Awe.  They will attempt to
maximise their safety, as they perceive it.  This may involve fleeing,
cowering, hiding, pleading and whimpering.  They will not usually
further endanger themselves in their attempt to escape, by running off
a cliff for example.  Add +5 to subsequent Awe Table rolls.

\item[77--90] Target is completely humbled and prostrates themself
before the source of the Awe.  They may take no other actions until
they are snapped out of their grovelling by an outside agency, or by
rolling less than or equal to their Willpower on D100.  They may
attempt this roll every second Pulse after being affected.  Add +10 to
subsequent Awe Table rolls.

\item[91--95] Target becomes hysterical and falls to the ground,
weeping, laughing, singing and/or praying as appropriate until snapped
out of it by an outside agency.  They may attempt to break out of it
by themself, by rolling less than or equal to their Willpower on D100,
at the end of each minute following the affect.  On recovery roll
D100: 1--50 slightly awed (as for 1--20, this table), 51--55 enamoured
(as for 21--25), 56--100 panic (as for 26--76).  Add +10 to subsequent
Awe Table rolls.

\item[96--100] Target collapses, becomes catatonic and may take no
further action until snapped out of it by an outside agency.  Upon
recovery roll D100: 1--26 slightly awed, 27--31 enamoured, 32--95 panic,
96--100 hysterical.  Add +15 to subsequent Awe Table rolls.

\item[101--106] Target faints dead away and will remain unconscious
for [D + 6] minutes.  Add +15 to all subsequent Awe Table rolls.

\item[107--110] Target suffer a mild heart seizure.  The result is the
same as for 101--106 except that the Target may not move about under
their own power for the remainder of the day and suffers a decrease of
2 to PS, MD, AG, EN, and FT, until either they spend one month resting
in bed, or their heart is repaired using the Healer ability ``Repair
Tissues and Organs''.  Add +15 to subsequent Awe Table tolls.

\item[111+] Target suffers a severe heart attack and must have the
attention of a Healer of at least Rank 2 within one minute (12 pulses)
or they will die.  Otherwise this result is the same as for 107--110,
except that +20 is added to subsequent Awe Table rolls.
\end{description}
\end{multicols}

\begin{multicols}{3}

\subsection{Notes}

Rolls against this table can made as the result of magic, when meeting
entities who are extremely ugly and occasionally in other extreme
situations.

\subsubsection{Modifiers}

All modifiers are cumulative lasting 24 hours or until 8 hours sleep,
but each division only counts once.  For example, a target gets feared
3 times.  The first is a hysterical which adds 10\%; second is
catatonic which adds 10\%.  Total so far is 20\%.  The third, however,
is another hysterical but as a hysterical component is already
included in the 20\%, the total remains at 20\%.  A minor heart attack
within 24 hours would push the total to 30\%.

\subsubsection{PB Fright Checks}
\index{physical beauty!fear}

Whenever characters encounter a creature whose Physical Beauty is less
than 5, and whose description states a Fear causing ability, they must
make a Willpower check to determine if they are frightened. The
difficulty factor for this test is equal to the creatures
PB. Creatures whose PB is 0 cause a once difficulty factor.  If this
test is failed, the character must then roll on the Fright Table and
apply any results before they take another action.  They may attempt
to recover every pulse, by trying to succeed at the same Willpower
check.  Until that time they will act as the Fright Table indicates.

\subsubsection{Familiarity}

In both the cases of the extremely low and high beauty, the effects
are reduced with familiarity with the creature causing the fear or
awe.  Once a character has successfully made their Willpower check, or
has recovered from a failed check, they need not check again (for an
effect from the same creature) for the remainder of the encounter.  If
the same creature is encountered again another Willpower check must be
made, but the GM may add 1 or more to the difficulty factor, thus
making it easier to succeed.  This bonus should not be applied to
encounters with other similar creatures, only to the same ones. (It is
not true to say that when you have seen one Troll, you have seen them
all).


\subsubsection{Effects of Awe}
\index{physical beauty!awe}

Whenever characters encounter a creature whose Physical Beauty is
above 26, and whose description states an Awe causing ability, they
must make a Willpower check to determine if they are awed. The
difficulty factor is dependent on the creatures PB:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
		& \textbf{Difficulty}\\
\textbf{PB}	& \textbf{Factor} \\
27--28		& 4.0 \\
29		& 3.5 \\
30		& 3.0 \\
31		& 2.5 \\
32		& 2.0 \\
33		& 1.5 \\
34		& 1.0 \\
35+		& 0.5 \\
\end{tabular}

If this Willpower check is failed the character must then roll on the
Awe Table (see \S\ref{tables:awe}) and apply any results before they
take another action.  They may attempt to recover from being over-awed
as indicated on the Awe Table.  Awe can be caused by a creature with a
Physical Beauty greater than 26. The range of the effect is line of
sight to the creature.  The character will only be affected if the
creature is within their line of sight, and they are facing towards
it.  Once seen, however, facing becomes irrelevant, \ie if the
Target turns away, so as to run, they do not lose the Awe effect
simply because they are no longer facing the source.  The effect will
remain until the Target is out of line of sight of the source.  Should
the character return into line of sight of the source, the same result
as before will be applied, unless their Willpower has increased, in
which case, they receive another Willpower check to resist the effect
of the Awe.

\subsubsection{Spell Effects}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
\index{fear!effects!wall of bones}
Wall of Bones (Necromancy): A target is not affected by the wall until
they touch it.  If they fail to resist they are affected any time they
are in line of sight of the wall but facing is not important (if a
target turns to flee the wall then they do not lose the fear because
they are no longer facing it).  If the target touches the same wall
again they make another resistance check.  Duration is that of the
spell; once the wall is gone so is the fear.

\item
\index{fear!effects!spell of fear}
Fear (Necromancy, Wicca, Celestial): single target spell.  If duration
is immediate then after (Rank of spell / 5) pulses, rounded up, the
target may make a 3 \x WP check each pulse to recover from fear,
otherwise the fear lasts the duration of the spell.  A further check
may be required to recover from the secondary effects of 76--90,
91--95 and 96--100.  Once recovered from, the spell has no further
effect.  The range of the spell only determines the possible targets,
so the target being more than this distance from the Adept will not
affect the duration.

\item
\index{fear!effects!spell of mass fear}
Mass Fear (Necromancy, Wicca): has set range and duration.  Range is a
sphere around the Adept.  Targets going out of range of the spell are
no longer affected.  Each time they re-enter the area of effect of the
spell they make another magic resistance (and roll on the Fright Table
if they fail).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example:} A group of adventurers are in the middle of a forest.
Rolf the Harrier gets struck by a Fear spell from Nasty the Necro, and
fails to resist.  A roll of 45 indicates panic.  Rolf's player thinks
Rolf has 3 options:

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item Run back to a clearing just left by the party.
\item Feeling no direction to be safe, Rolf clings to Hu'ug the giant's leg
and trembles.
\item Being a ``If I can't see them they can't see me'' believer, Rolf puts
a sack over his head.
\end{enumerate}

Rolf's player and the GM decide on percentages for the options and one
is determined.  In this case Rolf flees.  The spell is Rank 7 so Rolf
gets to attempt to snap out of the fear each pulse after the first
two.  Six pulses after the spell is cast, on his third try, Rolf
succeeds his 1 \x WP check and may turn around and attack Nasty the
Necro.

\subsubsection{PB Fright Checks}

When encountering an entity whose PB is 5 or less, PC's should roll
against [Entity's PB] \x (PC's WP).  If they fail this roll they must
then roll on the Fright Table, with the most severe effect possible
panic.  The GM may choose to waive this check, eg. the party has met
this troll a dozen times already.

Target is wary. Will not voluntarily approach the source of their

Target flies into a berserk rage.  They immediately charge to attack
the object of their rage.  If the source is not apparent they will

Target panics.  They attempt to maximise their safety in relation to

Add 5 to subsequent rolls on the Fright Table.

\item[77--90]
Target is frozen in fear.  They may take no action until snapped out
of it, eg. slapped on the face, attacked, etc.  The target can attempt
to break out of it themselves once by making a 1 \x WP check.  Once
broken out of it the target will remain wary.  Add 10 to subsequent

\item[91--95]
Target becomes hysterical.  They stand and scream and may take no
other action until snapped out of it ( as for 77--90).  On recovery
roll D100: 1--50 wary, 51--56: berserk, 56--100: panic.  Add 10 to
subsequent rolls on the fright table.

\item[96-100]
Target becomes catatonic.  Their hair turns white and may take no
other action until snapped out of it ( as for 77--90).  On recovery
roll D100: 1--26 wary, 21--31: berserk, 32--95: panic, 96--100:
hysterical.  Add 15 to subsequent rolls on the fright table.

\item[101--106]
Target faints, collapsing to the ground.  They remain unconscious for
[D + 6] minutes.  Add 15 to subsequent rolls on the fright table.

\item[107--110]
Target suffers a mild heart attack.  They remain unconscious for [D +
6] minutes and they are unable to move around under their own steam
for the rest of the day.  They suffer -2 to all characteristics until
they have spent one month resting in bed. Add 15 to subsequent rolls
on the fright table.

\item[111+]
Target suffers a major heart attack.  They must have the attention of
a Rank 3 (or greater) Healer within one minute (12 pulses) or die. If
they do survive all effects of 107--110 apply.  Add 20 to subsequent

But each division only counts once.  For example, a target gets feared
3 times.  The first is a panic which adds 5\%; second is hysterical
which adds 10\%.  Total so far is 15\%.  The third, however, is another
panic but as a panic component is already included in the 15\%, the
total remains at 15\%.  A minor heart attack within 24 hours would push
the total to 30\%.

Wall of Bones (Necromancy): A target is not effected by the wall until
they touch it.  If they fail to resist they are effected any time they
are in line of line of sight of the wall but facing is not important
(if a target turns to flee the wall then they do not loose the fear
because they are no longer facing it).  If the target sees the same
wall again the effect of the original fear check is applied. If their
resistance has changed (eg.  appropriate counterspell) then they may
resist the spell again.  Duration is that of the spell; once the wall
is gone so is the fear.
d116 9
a124 7
Fear (Necromancy, Wicca): duration is immediate.  After (Rank of spell
/ 5) pulses, rounded up, the target may make a 3 \x WP check each
pulse to recover from fear.  A further check may be required to
recover from the secondary effects of 91--95 and 96--100. Once
recovered from the spell has no further effect.  The range only
defines the adept's possible targets, that is going outside the range
will not change the effect of the spell on the target.

Mass Fear (Necromancy, Wicca) and Fear (Celestial): has set range and
duration.  Range is a sphere around the adept.  Targets going out of
range of the spell are no longer effected. Each time they re-enter the
area of effect the original fear result is re-applied.  If
immobilised, for example once snapped out the spell has no further
effect other than the Fright Table description.

Rolf the Harrier gets struck by a Necro fear spell from somewhere and
d149 6

Rolfs player and the GM decide on percentages for the options and one
is determined.  In this case Rolf flees.  The spell is rank 7 so the
range of it is 120 feet.  Rolf runs off at an angle to the Necro, and
runs 140 feet before getting out of range, whence the panic subsides.
Attempting to rejoin the party will simply restart the fear, Nasty the
Necro keeping concentration.  However, Nomum the Namer has followed
Rolf and places a Necro counterspell on him and uses her Military
Scientist ability to boost his WP as well.  Thus enamoured, Rolf
easily resists the spell this time and can rejoin the party.

Rolf gets +5\% on fright table rolls for the rest of the day.

optimise safety.

Target flies into berserk rage. Immediately charges to attack the
object of his rage. If the source is not apparent will charge about
noisily looking for it. Add 10 to Strike Chance and subtract 10 from
Defense.

Target panics. Attempts to maximise their perceived safety in relation
io the source of few.  This usually involves fleeing as rapidly as
possible, but could include cowering at the centre of the party, jumping
into someone's arms or burying their head in the sand, etc.  While a
state of panic prevails, some sanity is present and the target would
not, for example, normally run off the edge of a cliff (although they
might be allowed to cast a flying spell to facilitate their escape -
at a suitable minus of coursee).  Add 5 to any subsequent rolls on the
fright table.
d34 3
a36 4
Target is frozen in fear.  May take no action until snapped out of it,
for example slapped on face, stabbed with a weapon, etc.  The target
can break out of it themselves by rolling less than or equal to
willpower. Target gets one roll per pulse after the first pulse.  Once

Target becomes hysterical. Stands and screams until snapped out of (as
for 77-90).  May take no other action.  On recovery, roll Dl00: 1--50
wary; 51--55 berserk; 56--100 panic. Add 10 to subsequent fright table
rolls.
d47 4
a50 4
Target becomes catatonic. Hair turns white, may take no
action. Recovery as for 77--90.  Upon recovery, roll D100: 1-26 wary;
27--31 berserk; 32--95 panic; 96--100 hysterical. Add 15 to subsequent
fright table rolls.

Target faints dead away (collapsing to the ground).  He remains
unconscious for [D + 6] minutes.  Add 15 to all subsequcni rolls on
the Fright Table this day.

Target suffers a heart attack. The result is the same as for 101--106
except that the target may not move about under his own power for the
remainder of the day and suffer a decrease of 2 in all characteristics
until he has spent one month resting in bed. Add 15 to all subsequent
rolls on the Fright Table this day.
d64 5
a68 4
Target suffers a heart attack and must have medical attention
(cardiovascular resuscitation) within one minute (12 pulses of combat)
or die. If he does survive, all subsequent rolls on the Fright Table
are increased by 20 this day.

  Wall of Bones.  Range is line of sight (the targets view - if not
  facing it then is not affected until such time as target does face
  it).  Once viewed, facing is no longer important, that is if target
  turns to run from the wall then does not lose fear because they are
  no longer facing it.  The target will remain affected until out of
  line of sight of the wall.  Duration is that of the spell - once
  wall is gone, so is the fear.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
  \item
    Target panics and runs away from the wall around a corner. They
    are now out of line of sight and are not affected by the fear. If
    they should go back around the corner and the wall is still
    standing, they will simply panic again. However, if their
    resistance has changed, eg. bv a suitable counterspell, the wall
    is treated as a different one and a new resistance check is made,
    a new roll on the fright table being made if needed.

    \item
    Target immobilised ctc. WP rolls made as per table.  Once snapped
    out of it, the target has a pulse to act, the effect of the wall
    occurring after actions have been decided. If the target looks at
    the wall again the same fright table roll applies. If resistance
    has changed treat as above.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Mass Fear
  Has set range and duration.  Range is a sphere around the
  adept. Targets going out of range are treated as for wall of bones.
  If immobilised, etc.  once snapped out of it the spell has no
  further effect other than that described in the appropriate table
  description.

  \item Spell of Fear with ``immediate'' duration - Celestial and Black
  colleges.  After (rank of spell / 5) pulses, rounded up, the target
  may begin making WP rolls (once times) to spell it has no further
  effect. Note that recovery may require 2 WP checks.  This can occur
  for the effects of 91--95 and 96--100 since on recovering from the
  initial effect the target may need to recover from the secondary
  effect.  The range of the spell defines the maximum distance from
  Adept to target for tje spell to work. Moving outside that range
  once the spell has had an effect will not stop the spell's workings.

  \item Spell of fear with ``concentration'' duration -- Necromantic
  College.  This spell has a set range which means it functions like a
  mass fear, but affects only one target.  Passive concentration is
  required -- stunning etc. will break the spell.
