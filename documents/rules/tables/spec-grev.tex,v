@\section{Grievous Injury Table}
\label{tables:grievous}

\begin{multicols}{3}


A class weapons do grievous injuries on rolls of 01 through 20.  B
class weapons do grievous injuries on rolls of 21 through 80.  C class
weapons do grievous injuries on rolls of 70 through 100.

\begin{description}

\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item[01--05] Congratulations!  It's a bleeder in your primary arm!
Take 1 Damage Point from Endurance immediately and 1 per pulse
thereafter until the flow is staunched by a Healer of Rank 0 or above
or you die.

\item[06--07] Oh no!  Your opponent's weapon has entered your
secondary arm's elbow joint and the tip has broken off.  Take 2
Damage Points immediately from Endurance and that arm is useless until
the sliver has been removed by a Healer of Rank 3 or above.  Also,
increase the chance of infection by 30.

\item[08] A vicious puncture wound in your groin!  Take 3 Damage
Points immediately from Endurance and reduce your TMR by 2 until fully
recovered, which will take two months.  In addition, add 30 to your
chance of being infected (assuming you live long enough for such
things to matter).

\item[09--10] You have been stabbed in your secondary arm.  Drop
whatever you were holding in it and take 2 Damage Points immediately
from Endurance.  It will take a full week for the arm to be of any use
to you whatsoever.

\item[11] Your aorta is severed and you are quite dead.  Rest assured
your companions will do their best to console your widow(er).

\item[12] A stomach puncture.  Nasty. You suffer 3 Damage Points
immediately from Endurance and lose 2 from your TMR until fully
recovered, whcih will take two months.  Also, you are automatically
stunned for the next pulse (if you aren't already), after which you
may recover.  Add 20 to the chance to be infected. 

\item[13] Your opponent's weapons has entered your eye; roll D10.  On
a roll of 1, the weapon has entered your brain and you are dead.  On a
roll of 2--5, your left eye is blinded; on a roll of 6--10, your right
eye is blinded.  If you are lucky enough to be blinded instead of
killed, you have suffered 2 Damage Points to Endurance.  In addition,
a figure who is blind in one eye suffers the following subtractions:
-1 from MD, -2 from PB, -4 from Perception.  A figure blinded in one
eye reduces their base chance with any missile or thrown weapon by 30.

\item[14--18] Tsk, tsk.  A wound of the solid viscera.  Usually
fatal.  Take 3 Damage Points to Endurance immediately and 1 per pulse
thereafter until the bleeding is stopped by a Healer of Rank 2 or
above or you die.  Add 30 to the chance of infection.

\item[19--20] Take a stab in the leg (your choice as to which one)
resulting in a deep puncture of the thigh muscle.  Suffer 1 Damage
Point to Endurance immediately and reducd your TMR by 1 until you heal,
which will take 4 weeks.

\item[21--25] A chest wound.  Take 2 Damage Points to Endurance
immediately and reduce your TMR by 1 until recovered (about 2
months).  Look on the bright side, though.  Your attacker's weapon is
caught in your rib cage and has been wrenched from their grasp.

\item[26--27] Bad luck!  Your secondary hand has been severed at the
wrist.  Take 2 damage Points to Endurance immediately and subtract 1
point per pulse from Fatigue thereafter (Endurance when Fatigue is
exhausted) until you are dead or the bleeding is staunched by a Healer
of Rank 0 or above.   If you live, reduce your MD by 2.

\item[28--30] Worst luck!  Your primary hand has been severed.  See
result 26--27 for effects.

\item[31--34] A minor wound.  Your face is slashed open, ruining your
boyish good looks and causing blood to spurt into your eyes.  Reduce
your PB by 4 permanently.

\item[35] Your secondary arm is sliced off at the shoulder.  Take 5
Damage Points immediately from Endurance and 1 per pulse thereafter
from Fatigue (Endurance when Fatigue is exhausted) until you are dead
or the bleeding is staunched by a Healer of Rank 1 or above.  Reduce
your MD by 2 and your AG by 1.

\item[36] The same as 35, except it's your good primary arm that has
been lopped off.

\item[37--40] You have been eviscerated!  Take 4 Damage Points
immediately from Endurance and 1 point per pulse from Fatigue
thereafter (Endurance when Fatigue is exhausted) until you are
unconscious.  Increase your chance of infection by 40.

\item[41--42] A glancing blow lays open your scalp and severs one ear
(your choice as to which one).  Take 2 Damage Points immedately from
endurance.  Reduce your Perception by 2.

\item[43] A savage slash rips open your cheek and jaw.  Take an
automatic pass action next pulse due to the shock of the blow.  Your PB
is increased by 1, since your disfigurement will bring out the
maternal/paternal instincts in the opposite gender.

\item[44--50] A slash along one arm, and it's a bleeder!  Take 2
Damage Points immediately from Endurance and lose 1 point from Fatigue
(Endurance when Fatigue is exhausted) each pulse until the bleeding is
stopped by a Healer of Rank 1 or above or you die.

\item[51--52] Hamstrung!  Roll D10.  On a roll of 1--4, it is your
left leg.  On a roll of 5--10 its your right.  Take 4 Damage Points
immediately from Endurance and fall prone.  You may not stand
unassisted until the wound is healed (which should take three months).
Reduce your AG by 3 permanently.

\item[53--60] Your primary arm is crippled by a wicked slash!  Take 2
damage Points immediately to Endurance and drop anything you have in
your primary hand.  The arm is unusable until healed, which should
take 2 months.

\item[61--67] Your secondary arm is crippled; see 53--60 for details.

\item[68--69] A nasty slash in the region of the shoulder and neck.
Roll D10.  On a roll of 1--3, your head is severed and your corpse
tumbles to the ground.  On a roll of 4--6, your secondary collar bone
is crushed; on a roll of 7--10 your primary collar bone is crushed.
If your collar bone is crushed, the results are identical to 53--60,
except you suffer 4 Damage Points to Endurance.

\item[70--74] A crushing blow smashes your helmet and causes a
concussion.  Take 3 Damage Points from Endurance and suffer a
reduction of 4 in both MD and AG lasting for 3 days.

\item[75--80] A massive chest wound accompanied by broken ribs and
crushed tissues.  Very ugly, this.  Take 5 Damage Points immediately
from Endurance.  Reduce your MD and AG by 3 each until this wound
heals (should take about 4 months).  Increase your chance of infection
by 10.

\item[81--84] A crushing blow smashes tissue and produces internal
injuries.  You suffer 2 Damage Points immediately to Endurance and 1
per pulse thereafter to Fatigue (Endurance when Fatigue is exhausted)
until unconscious or you receive the attention of a Healer of Rank 2
or above.

\item[85--87] A jarring blow to your primary shoulder inflicts 2 Damage
points immediately to Endurance.  Roll D10; the result is the number
of pulses the arm is useless.  You immediately drop anything held in
that hand.

\item[88--89] Similar to 85--87 except it is your secondary shoulder.

\item[90--92] Your right hip is smashed horribly.  Take 5 damage
Points immediately to Endurance and fall prone.  You will be unable to
walk until the damage has healed (takes about 6 months).  Good fun.
When healed, you will still have a limp which will reduce your TMR by
1 and your AG by 2.

\item[93--94] The same as 90--92 except it is your left hip that is
smashed.

\item[95--97] Your opponent's weapon has come crashing down on your
head and fractured your skull.  You fall prone and are unconscious,
and take 8 damage Points to Endurance.  If you survive, you lose 2
from AG, 2 from MD and 2 from Perception.  It will take a year in bed
to recover.

\item[98--100] Crushing blow to your pelvis breaks bone and tears
tissue.  Take 7 damage Points immediately to Endurance and fall
prone.  Try to roll under your WP on D100 to avoid falling
unconscious.  If you survive, you will be unable to move for D10
months.
\end{description}}

\textbf{Notes}

The suggested recovery times are a guideline for the GM's to use in
determining how long characters should be kept out of action.  The
actions of a competent Healer may alter these times in some instances.

These Grievous Injuries are designed for combat between human-sized
opponents; any injuries sustained involving larger monsters should be
applied judiciously by the GM, taking into account size and mass
differences, etc.  Simply stated, a halfling would be hard put to
drive their dagger into the eye of an elephant, and in situations such
as these, the GM may have to disallow the Grievous Injury or change
its effects.

Any damage which results from a Grievous Injury is in addition to the
Endurance damage already determined.
