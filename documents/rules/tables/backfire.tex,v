@\section{Backfire Table}
\label{tables:backfire}
\begin{multicols}{3}

\begin{Description}

\item[Extra Fatigue] The following effects result in the Adept losing
extra Fatigue in order to contain the Backfire effect.  If no Fatigue
was expended during the cast then there will be no apparent effect.
If the Adept has insufficient Fatigue, then they lose all remaining
Fatigue and re-roll on this table for each Fatigue point they were
unable to expend, with any further rolls of Fatigue loss taken as
damage due to internal injuries.

\item[01--09] Fatigue loss equal to that already expended.

\item[10--16] Fatigue loss equal to twice that already expended.

\item[17--21] Fatigue loss equal to 3 times that already expended.

\item[22--24] Fatigue loss equal to 4 times that already expended.

\item[25] Fatigue loss equal to 5 times that already expended.

\item[Spell Awry] The following effects result in the spell working in
a manner that was not intended by the Adept.  The spell may still be
resisted by the eventual target, if the spell is resistible.  Note
that the Adept will not necessarily be aware of the outcome, since in
many cases there will be no apparent effect.

\item[26--30] The Adept becomes the target of the spell.

\item[31--32] The Adept becomes the target of the spell with some or
all effects doubled.

\item[33] The Adept becomes the target of the spell with some or all
effects tripled.

\item[34--35] The Adept becomes the target of the spell and the spell
is delayed by D10 pulses.

\item[36] The Adept becomes the target of the spell and the spell is
delayed by D100 pulses.

\item[37--39] The spell has opposite or different effect to that which
it was designed.

\item[40--41] The spell's effects are delayed by D10 pulses.

\item[42] The spell's effects are delayed by D100 pulses.

\item[43--45] The spell's effects are intermittent with D10 pulses or
minutes on, followed by D10 pulses or minutes off.

\item[46--48] The spell affects a random target or area within range,
or goes in a random direction.

\item[49] The spell affects a random target or area within twice range.

\item[50] The spell affects a random target or area within three times
range.

\item[51] The spell is cast at random as though the caster is a random
entity within D10 hexes.

\item[52--53] The spell affects a random target or area within range
with some or all effects doubled.

\item[54] The spell's effects are delayed by D10 pulses and affects a
random target or area.

\item[55] The spell's effects are delayed by D100 pulses and affects a
random target or area.

\item[56--57] The spell works with some or all effects halved.

\item[58] The spell works as normal.

\item[59] The spell works with some or all effects doubled.

\item[60] The spell works with some or all effects tripled.

\item[Minor Curses] The following effects result in the Adept being
afflicted by a minor curse.  The Adept may resist the curse by using
their Magical Resistance against non--College Magic.  Some curses can
be cured by healing skills, and all may be dispelled by a curse
removal.  Any result specifying a gradual loss of statistics will also
cause an immediate loss.

\item[61] Blind for D10 pulses.

\item[62] Blind for D10 \x D10 minutes.

\item[63] Blind for D10 \x D10 hours.

\item[64] Blind for D10 days.

\item[65] Deaf for D10 pulses.

\item[66] Deaf for D10 \x D10 minutes.

\item[67] Deaf for D10 \x D10 hours.

\item[68] Deaf for D10 days.

\item[70] Mute for D10 \x D10 minutes.

\item[71] Mute for D10 \x D10 hours.

\item[72] Mute for D10 days.

\item[73] Lose smell and taste for D10 days.

\item[74] Lose smell and taste for D10 \x D10 days.

\item[75] Lose tactile sense for D10 days.

\item[76] Lose tactile sense for D10 \x D10 days.

\item[77] Insomnia such that only 1 Fatigue is recovered for each hour
of sleep for D10 days.

\item[78] Insomnia such that only 1 Fatigue is recovered for each hour
of sleep for D10 \x D10 days.

\item[79--80] A virulent skin disease halves Physical Beauty and causes
intense itching which will increase the difficulty of concentration
checks by 1, until stopped by Cure Disease.

\item[81] Wasting disease causes -1 Strength and -1 Endurance per day
until stopped by Cure Disease.  The Strength and Endurance lost will
be recovered at 1 point per day, or by being treated by Repair
Muscles.

\item[82--83] Periodic muscle spasms lasting D10 pulses cause a loss of
1 Fatigue each pulse.  There is D10 \x D10 minutes between spasms.
This can be cured by Repair Muscles.

\item[84] A deep sleep for D10 pulses.

\item[85] A deep sleep for D10 \x D10 minutes.

\item[86--87] Recurring migraines cause a loss of 2 Magical Aptitude
and 2 Willpower.  Each minute of concentration requires a 4 \x
Willpower concentration check.  The effects can be treated by Soothe
Pain and cured by Repair Vital Organs.

\item[88] Periodic hallucinations for D10 hours. Each hallucination
lasts D10 pulses and there is D10 \x D10 minutes between them.  Can be
cured by Repair Vital Organs.

by 1 per hour the Fatigue loss due to exercise, until treated by
Repair Tissues.

\item[91--92] Enfeeblement causes -4 Strength, -4 Endurance and
doubles the Fatigue loss due to exercise, until treated by Repair
Muscles.

\item[93] Asthma causes TMR to be halved, doubles the Fatigue loss due
to exercise, and the Adept cannot perform strenuous exercise until
treated by Repair Vital Organs.

\item[94--95] Creeping senility will cause a loss of 1 Magical Aptitude
every two days until treated by Regenerate Vital Organs.

\item[96] Partial Amnesia causes the loss of all Magical abilities for
D10 days.

\item[97] Partial Amnesia causes the loss of all Skills (excluding
Magic and Weapons) for D10 days.

\item[98] Partial Amnesia causes the loss of all memories from the past
2D10 months.  The Adept will operate at lower ranks in the abilities
that have been ranked during this period.  The memories will return at
a rate of 1 month each day.

\item[99] Total Amnesia causes the loss of all memories for D5 \x D5
days.  All magic and skills other than the primary language will be
lost, and all weapon ranks will be halved (round down) or lost if Rank
0.  The Adept's original personality will come to the fore and they
may need to make a reaction roll to determine their initial feelings
towards each person.

\item[00] Roll two more times and apply both effects.

GMs are free to develop their own backfire table so that an adept is
never sure about what is likely to happen from a backfire.  Note that
the general structure of the table should be retained, with 25\% of
results being Fatigue loss, 35\% with the spell going wrong, and 40\%
afflictions or minor curses.  The GM is free to alter durations and
effects on the backfire table, for example choosing instead of rolling
for the duration of an affliction.  Some ideas when inflicting
backfires are to make Special Knowledge spell backfires worse than
General Knowledge, and higher ranked spell backfires worse than those
of low ranked spells.

{\fontsize{8}{9pt}\selectfont
\begin{description}
\item[{\em Dice}] {\bf \em Backfire Result}

\item[01--10] How unfortunate!  Not only do you fail to cast the spell,
but it costs you twice the normal Fatigue.

\item[11--17] Worse yet!  You fail to cast the spell, and costs you
three times the normal Fatigue.

\item[18--22] For shame!  You should be grateful that your teachers
cannot see you in your hour of degradation.  Not only do you fail to
cast the spell, but it costs you four times the normal Fatigue.

\item[23--24] This is simply not your day.  Not only do you fail to
cast the spell, but it costs you five times the normal Fatigue.

\item[25] Magic may not be your calling.  You might consider a future
in animal husbandry instead.  Not only do you fail to cast the spell,
but it costs you six times the normal Fatigue.

\item[26--35] Your spell has reversed itself and is presently taking
full effect on your own person instead of on the intended target.

\item[36--45] Once again your spell has reversed itself as in result
26--35.  However, this time, in addition to the effects of the
reversal, it costs twice the normal Fatigue.

\item[46--50] Your companions may well curse your name for this!  The
GM assigns a number to each character within Range and rolls D10.  The
character whose number is first rolled is the target of the spell.  If
no character's number is rolled, the GM rolls again until one
character's number is rolled.

\item[51--55] A result similar to 46--50 except the spell's effect is
doubled (GM choosing what attribute of the spell will be doubled).

\item[56--60] Your spell takes effect, but only at half strength.  The
GM determines what characteristic is to be halved and does so
(rounding down).

\item[61] You are cursed with total blindness lasting D10 weeks.

\item[62] You are cursed with total blindness lasting 2 \x D10 weeks.

\item[63] You are cursed with total blindness lasting 3 \x D10 weeks.

\item[64] You are cursed with total deafness lasting D10 weeks.

\item[65] You are cursed with total deafness lasting 2 \x D10 weeks.

\item[66] You are cursed with total deafness lasting 3 \x D10 weeks.

\item[67] You are cursed with total muteness lasting D10 weeks.

\item[68] You are cursed with total muteness lasting 2 \x D10 weeks.

\item[69] You are cursed with total muteness lasting 3 \x D10 weeks.

\item[70] You are cursed with insomnia and nightmares and may only
regain half Fatigue (rounded up) during sleep periods for a number of
weeks equal to D10.

\item[71] You are cursed with insomnia and nightmares and may only
regain half Fatigue (rounded up) during sleep periods for a number of
weeks equal to twice D10.

\item[72] You are cursed with insomnia and nightmares and may only
regain half Fatigue (rounded up) during sleep periods for a number of
weeks equal to three times D10.

\item[73--75] You are cursed with a virulent skin disease which will cause
you intense pain and make you hideous to look upon.  The disease will
reduce your Physical Beauty by 10 and your willpower by 3 until cured
by magic or the arts of a healer.  Once cured, the disease will still
reduce your Physical Beauty by 1 for each full week during which it
affected you.  This reduction is a permanent result of scarring.

\item[76--80] You are cursed with periodic muscle spasms of random
occurrence and unpredictable duration which tend to leave you limp and
exhausted.  The spasms will persist until you are cured by magic or
the arts of a Rank 2 healer.  Reduce MD by 5 and Endurance by
half (round down) until cured.

\item[81--85] You begin to suffer from intense and regularly
occurring migraines which reduce your Willpower by 1 and your Magical
Aptitude by 3 until cured of your affliction either by magic or a Rank
2 healer.

\item[86--90] You become arthritic and enfeebled and will remain so
until cured by magic or the arts of a Rank 3 healer.  Reduce your
Fatigue by half (round down) and subtract 4 from Dexterity and 3 from
Agility until cured.

\item[91--95] You have become subject to creeping senility which will
last until cured by magic (only) and which will become worse as time
goes on.  Your Magical Aptitude is immediately reduced by 2 and is
reduced by an additional 2 at the beginning of each week until cured.
Once cured of your affliction, you will have to relearn any spells
forgotten during the period of your illness.  All spell attempts made
during the illness will have their Base Chance of taking effect reduced
by 10.

\item[96--100] You are cursed with total amnesia and lose all skills,
ranks and magical abilities for a period of D10 days.  During this
time, you may not cast spells, use special skills or talents or use a
weapon except in its unranked state.  Your friends will have to care
for you since your surroundings are totally unfamiliar and your
survival defences will have been quite effectively short-circuited.
You will willingly take their orders and advice, but you would just as
willingly follow an ogre into his cave if he asked.
