\begin{description}

\item[D100] A roll with two D10 dice, giving a uniformly distributed
value between 1 and 00 (100).

\item[D10] A roll with a single D10 die, giving a uniformly distributed
value between 1 and 10.

\item[D] See D10.

\item[Modifiers] All modifiers, unless specified, are chance modified,
that is they affect base chance, strike chance, etc.  See below for
die modifiers.

\item[Die modifiers] Die modifiers are added or subtracted directly from
the value of the die roll.  Because the system is a criticals system,
die modifiers have a much greater effect than chance modifiers.

\item[Criticals] There are five levels of success given a die roll
verses some chance.  A roll of $\leq$ 5\% of the chance is a critical
success (see triple effect in magic or possible grievous blow in
combat, skill or stat rolls do not have critical successes).  A roll
of $\leq$ 15\% of the chance is a exceptional success (see double
effect in magic or endurance blow in combat, skill or stat rolls do
not have exceptional successes).  Critical failures depend on the type
of roll.  Magic critical failures are defined under backfires in
magic.  Combat critical failures result in weapon breaks or drop.
Stat rolls have a critical failure of \emph{70 + stat + difficulty}.
Skill rolls have a critical failure of \emph{90 + Rank}.  Note that a
00 is always a critical failure.

\item[Stat rolls] Stat rolls have a difficulty factor, so that a base
chance for a stat roll is \emph{stat $\times$ difficulty + modifiers}.
To calculate a stat multiple (the converse of a difficulty factor),
make the roll, then modify the die value by any die modifier.
Subtract any chance modifiers (such as Enchantment) and then divide by
the appropriate stat.  This value, rounded up, is the correct stat
multiple.  For example, a person with PC of 14, and enchantment of 11,
and a lesser enchantment, rolls a 89 on the die.  They subtract 1 from
die to for lesser enchantment.  They then subtract 11 for the
enchantment, giving 77.  77 / 14 gives 5.5, so they made a 6 times PC
roll, but failed a 5 times roll.


\item[{$\left[{x}\right]$}] Take the value $x$, minimum 1, so
$[\mbox{D} - 5]$ means roll a D10, subtract 5, and if the value is
less than one, then take it to be one.

\item[$\lfloor \mbox{Rank} / x\rfloor$] Take the value of Rank / $x$
and round down.  Often see as just \emph{Rank / $x$}, \emph{1 for
every $n$ Ranks} or \emph{$1 / x$ Ranks}, e.g.\ if the Rank is 11 then
\emph{Rank / 3} is 3.

\item[{$\lceil \mbox{Rank} / x\rceil$}] Take the value of Rank / $x$
and round up.  Often see as just \emph{Rank / $x$ or fraction},
\emph{1 for every $n$ or fraction Ranks} or \emph{$1 / x$ or fraction
Ranks}, e.g.\ if the Rank is 11 then \emph{Rank / 3 or fraction} is 4.

\item[$x$ / Rank] Means $x \times \text{Rank}$. \emph{$x$ / Rank} does
not include Rank 0.  Any bonus for Rank 0 is defined as \emph{$n + x$
/ Rank}.

\item[$x$ per Rank] Equivilent to $x \times \text{Rank}$.  Rank 0 is
never counted as a Rank for calculations, unless explicitly specified.
