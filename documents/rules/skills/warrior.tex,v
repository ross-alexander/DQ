@\begin{skill*}{Warrior}{2.0}{warrior}

Warriors practice the art of melee combat until it becomes a series of
finely honed instincts.  They practise on all terrains with all types
of weapons against different configurations and tactics, so that they
may always respond optimally with the need for thought.  Unlike most
professions that impart knowledge through practise and theory, the
warrior skill is all about practise for its own sake.

The discipline and training regime associated with warrior training is
often liked to ethical codes such as chivalry, and training is often
only available after indoctrination to a code.  This is unsurprising,
as a warrior gains no advantage unless facing an active opponent.
While there is no reason why a warrior should not also be an assassin,
as a warrior becomes more skilled, their training and instincts will
push them towards fair combat.

\subsection{Restrictions}

\subsubsection{Benefits only apply when the warrior is occupying an
enemy's melee zone.}

\subsubsection{A warrior may never train in the warrior skill without a
training partner of at least equal warrior Rank.}

A warrior needs a training partner of at least their current skill
level in order to practice combat, they cannot practice on their own.

\subsubsection{A warrior requires various minimum weapons skills per Rank.}

Before being able to achieve any new Rank in the warrior skill, a
character must first have achieved a certain standard of weapon
proficiency, with a variety of weapons.  Firstly a warrior must have
at least Rank 4 with a weapon rated for close combat.  Secondly a
warrior must achieve the Ranks summarised in the attached table.

\subsection{Benefits}

\subsubsection{A warrior gains a bonus to defence when facing an
opponent wielding a weapon they are familiar with.}

When facing a weapon, which is from a category in which the warrior
has Ranks, the warrior gains a bonus to their defence of either (2 +
4\% per Rank of the highest Ranked weapon the warrior has in the
category) or (2 + 2\% per warrior Rank), whichever is lower.

\subsubsection{A warrior gains + 1 / Rank to their engaged initiative.}

No bonus is gained at Rank 0.

\subsubsection{A warrior has the ability to wield weapons which are
similar to other weapons with which they is familiar.}

A warrior may use any weapon from a category in which they have Ranks
at half the Rank of their maximum Ranked weapon in that category or at
half their warrior Rank, whichever is lower.

\subsubsection{A warrior gains the ability to Rank weapons without the
need for a tutor.}

A warrior is able to Rank a weapon without a tutor from a category in
which they already have Ranked weapons, for an additional 10\% EP
cost, as long as the Rank they are attaining is not greater than their
highest Ranked weapon in that category.  When attempting to attain
higher Ranks or Rank with a weapon from a category in which they do
not have Ranks in, a warrior must expend 25\% more experience to Rank
a weapon without a tutor.

\subsubsection{A warrior's base chance to hit is increased by 1\% + 1\%
additional per Rank.}

A warrior also inflicts an extra point of damage at Ranks 5 \& 10, and
gains a bonus of +1 at Ranks 4 \& 8 to the parry calculation.

\subsubsection{A warrior becomes an expert in combat equipment.}

A warrior is treated as a merchant of their warrior Rank when
attempting to buy or value non-magical weapons (including shields),
with which they are familiar. If they have a passing familiarity with
the weapon (\ie has Ranks in the same category but not the actual
weapon) they will act as a merchant of half their warrior Rank.  If
they are completely unfamiliar with the equipment they may not use
this ability.

\section{Warrior (Ver 2.0)}
\label{warrior}
d3 14
a16 74
\index{warrior|(}
\index{skills!warrior|(}
A warrior is one who learns the art of combat. The skill is not so
much concerned with weapon skills as with combat skills. As such
weapons not used in melee combat (\eg bows) and uses of weapons
that are not melee oriented (\eg throwing weapons or attacking
from behind or close combat, although it is expected that a warrior
will have some skill in close and ranged combat) receive no bonus
from this skill.  To understand the warrior skill it is important to
realize that unlike other skills where advancement is dependent
equally on knowledge and practice, for a warrior advancement must
revolve around practice primarily and knowledge of special moves and
tactics is less important.  Thus a warrior does not necessarily know
more about combat than another fighter, but is more practiced at all
the possible variations on combat.

The advantages a warrior receives in melee combat accrue because of
their experience in combat both against and with all types of
weapons. They train on all terrains and in all combinations (\eg one
on one, one on two, two on one etc.) and in the process learn the
advantages and disadvantages of each weapon and each combat situation.

More importantly, because the warrior spends so much of their time
training in weapons and in combat, the individual weapon skills become
more than a set of well learned thrusts, cuts, parries, and ripostes --
they become reactions. Thus a warrior no longer decides their action
whether it be right or wrong, they react, and because of their
training their reactions are the best possible given the weapon they
are using, the weapon they are facing, and the situation they are
in.

Obviously the skill teaches more than just the appropriate reactions;
a warrior will become able to choose the best weapon and tactics for
any given engagement, they will be able to make the best use of the
terrain, and the other relevant factors to improve their chances of
success. But ultimately once the preliminary decisions have been made,
when weapon meets weapon it is their trained reactions that give the
warrior the real advantage in combat.

As a result of the dedication to training required to become a warrior
the skill has become associated with other codes of conduct, such as
chivalry and honourable combat, which may govern a warrior's whole
outlook on life.  But as should be clear it is not necessary to have a
code of ethics to be a warrior, the skill is a result of training,
although it may prove difficult to be trained without being
indoctrinated by the teacher, and as such many warriors will come out
of training with a specific code of ethics.  Equally obvious should be
the fact that there is no specific reason why a warrior cannot become
an assassin or an assassin become a warrior.  Of course many warriors
will be trained to abhor assassins and assassination. The warrior
skill will give no advantage to situations where the attack is more
akin to assassination than combat.

Nevertheless some of the results of the training could easily be
confused with an ethical code, and this is perhaps why the warrior
skill is often considered part of an honourable or chivalric code. To
explain this, it is necessary to look at how the warrior trains.  They
spend most of their time in combat --- not deadly combat, but
practice.  This is when they learn how to use their knowledge of
combat and tactics. The purpose of this combat is to practice the
skill of combat; thus once an opponent is defeated the combat is over
and a new one begins.  In short the warrior's natural instincts in
combat are to defeat the opponent, not necessarily kill them.

The natural result of this kind of training is that a warrior gains no
advantages when his opponent cannot reply (due to surprise, stunning,
disarming, always remembering unarmed combat as a legitimate weapon,
etc.). This is an interactive skill; to gain their bonuses a warrior
needs an active opponent. As is obvious from the above the warrior
loses all their skill bonuses if they attack an opponent who cannot
reply; they simply have not trained for such a situation (that's an
executioner's or assassin's job).  While such an attack may be in
character, as the warrior becomes more skilled their instincts will
push them towards ``fair'' combat (not to mention their ego).

Note to find the requirements for any given Rank find the Rank in the
first column and read across the row noting requirements in each
column. Thus to achieve a given Rank a warrior must have at least one
weapon of the minimum Rank (given in the minimum Rank column) in at
least as many categories as given in the no. categories column
(categories refers to the weapon categories assigned in the attached
list of weapons).  In addition the warrior must have weapons of higher
Rank as noted in the other columns.

himself to maintain contacts etc.
