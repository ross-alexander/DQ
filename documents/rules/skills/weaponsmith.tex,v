@\begin{skill}{Weaponsmith}{1.0}{weaponsmith}

\subsection{Restrictions}

\subsubsection{A weaponsmith's progress in their skill is inhibited by a
low Manual Dexterity, and aided by a high Manual Dexterity.}

A weaponsmith has an increased Experience Point cost of 5\% for each
point of Manual Dexterity less than 16.  A character decreases their
Experience point cost by 5\% for each point of Manual Dexterity
greater than 20.  A character will have great difficulty passing their
weaponsmith apprenticeship if their Manual Dexterity is less than 10.

\subsection{Benefits}

\subsubsection{A weaponsmith acquires one ability every two Ranks.  The
character begins with one of the following abilities at Rank 0.  All
abilities can be performed skillfully.}

{\raggedright \begin{Enumerate}
\item Make and maintain swords including daggers.
\item Make and maintain hafted weapons.
\item Make and maintain thrown weapons.
\item Make and maintain pole weapons.
\item Make and maintain missile weapons.
\item Make and maintain entangling weapons.
\item Make and maintain experimental weapons.
\item Make and maintain siege engines.
\end{Enumerate}}

A weaponsmith may gain additional abilities after achieving Rank 10 by
the expenditure of 10000 experience points per ability.

\subsubsection{A weaponsmith can build increasingly more effective
weapons as their Rank increases.}

For every Rank that a weaponsmith achieves, they may create weapons
that have an increased base chance of 1\%.  For every Rank divisible
by \emph{five} that a weaponsmith achieves, they may create weapons
that cause an extra point of damage.  These two effects are \emph{not}
cumulative.

For example, a Rank 8 weaponsmith may construct a weapon with a Base
Chance increased by 3\% and a Damage Modifier increased by 1, or a
weapon with a BC increased by 8\% and no increase in DM.

\textbf{Note:} The weapons statistics as shown in the weapons chart are
manufactured at an effective Rank of 0 \ie they are the mass-produced
variety.  They may have been manufactured by a weaponsmith of greater
Rank than this, but the skill level used was elementary.

\subsubsection{The time and cost required for a weaponsmith to
construct a weapon is dependent on the Rank that is used, and the type
of weapon.}

A Weapon may be manufactured at any Rank up to the weaponsmith's Rank.
\begin{Enumerate}
\item
The \emph{time} required is (10 \x (Effective Rank + DM)) hours, with
a minimum of 10 hours.

\item
The \emph{cost} is 80\% of the Base Cost as shown in the weapons table
\x (effective Rank + 1 + DM increase) silver pennies.
\end{Enumerate}

\subsubsection{A weaponsmith is treated as a merchant of their
weaponsmith Rank when attempting to buy or value weapons which are
part of their abilities.}

If the equipment concerned is unfamiliar, then they operate as a
merchant of half their Rank (rounded down).

\subsection{Costs}

\subsubsection{A weaponsmith, with the exception of some missile
weapons, can only perform their skill in a properly maintained
workshop.}

It costs 2000 silver pennies to construct a workshop and 500 silver
pennies per year to maintain it with tools and materials.  A basic
tool kit will cost 100 + (100 \x Rank) silver pennies.  A workshop may
be rented at a cost of 10 silver pennies per day.

\subsection{Silvering and Gilding weapons}

An item made of silvered metal costs 10 times the normal cost for the
item made simply of cold iron.  A gilded item will cost 120 times the
normal cost for the item made of cold iron alone.  Truesilver will
cost 180 times the cost of the item made from cold iron alone.

The cost of silvering or gilding is added to the base cost of the
weaponsmithed item so that the cost of a silvered sword is Base Cost
\x (80\% \x (effective Rank + 1 + DM) + 10) silver pennies.
