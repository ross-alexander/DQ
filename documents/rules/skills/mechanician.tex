\begin{skill}{Mechanician}{2.1}{mechanician}

Mechanicians are a blend of engineer and builder who possess both
design knowledge and crafting ability so that they may plan and
personally manufacture devices. Even without modern power sources and
techniques, Mechanicians can still build quite sophisticated devices
using systems such as springs, hydraulics and wind-based motor systems
to drive well greased moving parts. Mechanicians may also be called on
to devise locks and traps to foil the efforts of thieves. They often
practice a particular trade and are called Locksmiths, Shipwrights,
Architects, etc. A skilled mechanician may master several such
professions. Mechanicians often build overly large and complex devices
that are frequently non-functional and occasionally dangerous. Their
profession is usually considered more of an art than a science.

\subsection{Restrictions}

A Character must be literate in at least one language at Rank 6 or
above to acquire the mechanician skill.

MD affects a mechanician's Experience costs. A mechanician pays 10\%
extra EP if their MD is less than 15 and pays 10\% less if their MD is
more than 22.

A mechanician must pay money for the upkeep of a studio or workshop,
tools, work-in-progress and possibly guild fees.

The more complex, dangerous and experimental a mechanician's project
is, the more likely that it is to be temperamental, expensive to
upkeep and prone to breakdowns.

\subsection{Benefits}

\begin{Description}
\item[Drafting]
A mechanician may draft and use plans accurately.  A mechanician may
draw freehand sketches and may draft, read and use plans and diagrams,
provided that they relate to an ability with which the mechanician is
familiar and that the mechanician is literate in the language used.

\item[Supervision]
Many projects will require the assistance of artisans and labourers,
as well as other mechanicians. Mechanicians gain the ability to
supervise subordinates who are practising either the mechanician skill
or an artisan skill necessary to the mechanician's project.

\item[Artisan discount]
Many of the mechanician abilities give the character a grounding in an
Artisan skill. A character may rank artisan skills that are listed
under abilities they have learned, at half of the normal experience
cost and time (round up), up to the same Rank as mechanician. Artisan
skills are shown in the mechanician ability listings as [craft].

\item[Combinations]
A mechanician may combine known abilities.  A mechanician may combine
any or all of their areas of expertise in the design and execution of
a project. A mechanician may also combine their skills with other
crafters to produce items. The GM must decide, based on the abilities
possessed by the mechanician and other assistants, whether or not they
may design and build a certain project.

\end{Description}

\begin{example}
A mechanician who knew bridge building, stoneworking, earthworks and
hydro engineering, could design and build an aqueduct that spanned a
gorge. A mechanician who knew chronometrical engineering, fine
materials and spell containment, might design and build a ``magical
trap'' that has a time delay in the trigger mechanism.  A mechanician,
an armourer and a weaponsmith could combine abilities to build a suit
of plate armour with retractable blades at various locations.  A
mechanician wishes to build a mill using a waterwheel for power. The
GM determines that they will need the architecture, complex mechanics,
stoneworking and woodworking abilities. A mechanician who knew
boat building and animal and textile products, could design and build
a sail powered coracle made of leather, but not a wooden dinghy.
\end{example}

\subsection{Abilities}

All mechanicians have certain rudimentary abilities.  At Rank 0 a
mechanician gains an in-depth knowledge of basic mechanics (including
levers, wedges, simple gears and pulleys, balances and use of ropes)
and basic foundations (including simple earthworks, digging and
shoring pits, piled stone walls and brickmaking and
laying). [Brickmaker /layer].

After Rank 0 a mechanician acquires one new ability per Rank.
Additional abilities may be gained after achieving Rank 10, by the
expenditure of 1500 Experience Points and 4 weeks of training.

Some mechanician abilities give abstract comprehension of the theory,
design and construction techniques involved in crafting different
projects. Others offer an understanding of materials along with a
basic practical knowledge and ability in crafting those substances.
Each ability lists the particular crafts or substances with which
knowledge is gained. Special abilities are fully explained in later
sections of this skill.

Mechanician knowledge is of a more practical and less esoteric nature
than that gained through equivalent philosopher fields and may be
complemented by the acquisition of philosophic knowledge.

\end{Description}

\subsection{Complex Locks}

\begin{Description}

\item[Rank]
A Complex Lock is considered to have a Rank, which is the Effective
Rank that the mechanician used in the construction of the lock.  The
Rank of a lock may be less than or equal to the Rank of the
mechanician constructing it.

\item[Time \& cost]
The time to construct a Complex Lock is: (11 + Lock Rank - mechanician
Rank) hours.

The cost is (25 \x Lock Rank [minimum 10]) sp.

\end{Description}

A mechanician may always open one of their own Locks in: (12 -
mechanician Rank) minutes.

\subsection{Trap Construction}
\label{mechanician:traps}
\begin{Description}

\item[Rank]
A trap is considered to have a Rank, which is the Effective Rank that
the mechanician used in the construction of the trap.  The Rank of a
trap may be less than or equal to the Rank of the mechanician
constructing it.

\item[Time \& cost]
The time and cost to create a trap will vary greatly, depending on the
complexity, size and nature of the trap.

The most commonly encountered type of mechanician trap is the
precision trap.  This is the type of small needle or blade trap that
may be set into or adjacent to locks or other precision devices.

A lock or similar device may have up to Rank / 3 (round up) traps on
or adjacent to it.

The time to build each trap is: (11 + Trap Rank - mechanician Rank)
hours.

The cost is: (125 \x Trap Rank) sp, minimum of 50, plus the cost of
poisons, alchemical materials.

A triggered trap may be reset by any Mechanician whose Rank is at
least half that of the trap. This will take: (11 - mechanician Rank)
hours. A trap may need refuelling.

A mechanician may disable or re-enable one of their own traps in (12 -
mechanician Rank) minutes.

\item[Triggering]
The precise actions that will trigger a trap must be specified at the
time that the trap is constructed.  Traps on a lock or other precision
device are automatically triggered if the device is operated in the
pre-specified manner and the traps have not been removed or disabled.

\item[Damage]
A trap may be built that causes physical damage or explosively
discharges its contents in a cone up to: (Trap Rank + 1) feet wide and
(10 + Trap Rank) long, or activates the mechanical trigger of a ``spell
container''.

A precision trap that causes physical damage may cause up to: [D10 +
Trap Rank] Damage Points. It may also be poisoned, coated with acid,
etc., so as to cause additional damage.

\end{Description}

\subsection{Spell Containment}
\label{mechanician:containment}

\index{spell storage!mechancian traps}

A mechanician may use this ability to create a spell container, or
magical trap, with a mechanical trigger.

\begin{Description}

\item[Construction]
The mechanician with the ``spell containment'' and ``fine materials''
abilities can build a mechanical device into which a spell can be
stored.  The device is usually referred to as a magical trap, or a
spell container.  The device is made out of silver, truesilver or
starsilver.  Often the device is built inside or incorporating other
materials with which the mechanician is familiar.

\item[Spell Storage]
A single charge of a suitable spell may be stored in the trap or
container by an Adept successfully casting a spell into the device
after performing Ritual Spell Preparation.  A double or triple effect
stores an enhanced spell as specified by the Adept.  A failure has no
effect.  A backfire affects the Adept as normal, and also results in
the device being damaged so that 20\% more time and materials are
required before another try at storing a spell may be attempted.  The
spell to be stored must include a Storage type of ``Magical Trap''.

\item[Triggering]
The precise actions that will trigger the device must be specified at
the time that the device is constructed.  When these actions are
performed the spell is released.  The spell stored must either affect
only the entity or object that triggered the release of the spell, or
affect an area in relation to the device.  All variable spell effects,
such as direction and volume affected, must be defined at the time of
storage.  Once the spell has been triggered the device is useless,
although metal equal to 10\% of the cost may be recovered.  If the
spell is dissipated, then 20\% of the cost may be recovered.

\item[Time to construct] 25 - (2 \x mechanician Rank) hours.

\item[Time to store spell] (Spell Rank - mechanician Rank) hours, (minimum 1,
and maximum 10).

\item[Cost] (Spell Rank (minimum 1) \x Spell EM) + 100 sp.

\item[Minimum Weight] (16 - mechanician Rank) ounces.
