\begin{skill}{Assassin}{1.0}{assassin}

Assassin is not a skill which should be carelessly chosen, as the
skill is not looked upon with great favour by members of society (at
least until they need one).  Assassins will vary in philosophy and
methods; they may be cold-hearted but not necessarily evil.  The GM
must allow assassins to practice their art as they wish, and this may
result in solo adventures.

\subsection{Restrictions}

\subsubsection{An assassin must be able to use the sap or garotte at a
minimum of Rank 1 before advancing past Rank 2.}

\subsection{Benefits}

\subsubsection{An assassin increases their chance of causing a Grievous
injury as their Rank increases.}

If the assassin is attacking in a surprise situation, their chance of
causing a Grievous Injury is increased by 2\% per Rank.  If an
assassin attacks a victim through a rear hexside during combat, their
chance of causing a Grievous Injury is increased by 1\% for every
Rank.  If an assassin attacks a victim through a front hexside during
combat, their chance of causing a Grievous Injury is increased by 1\%
for every three Ranks (round down).  An assassin does not gain the
above bonuses when engaging in Ranged Combat.

\subsubsection{An assassin may gain information from a victim through
torture.}

The assassin must torture their victim for a period equal to (Victim's
Willpower / Assassin's Rank) hours to try to to gain an important
secret. The assassin's chance of forcing the victim to reveal the
secret is ( 10 \x Assassin's Rank - 4 \x Victim's Willpower)\%.  If
the GM's roll on percentile dice is equal to or less than the success
percentage, the assassin gains the exact information they require.  If
the assassin fails to gain the desired information, they may try
another torture attempt.  A victim can withstand a number of torture
attempts equal to one fifth their Endurance (round down) before they
die.

If the information an assassin seeks is not of great importance to the
victim, the GM should decrease the time required to gain it and
increase the assassin's success chance appropriately.

\subsubsection{An assassin is trained to improve their memory.}

Whenever an assassin wishes to recall the details of a place or
routine they have surveyed, the GM rolls percentile dice.  If the roll
is equal to or less than (5 \x Perception + 2 \x Rank), the assassin
has a perfect memory of the place or routine.  If the roll is greater
than the assassin's success percentage, the GM should inveigle more
and more erroneous information into their description as the roll
approaches 100.

The GM may decrease the success percentage for difficult feats of
memory.

\subsubsection{An assassin is able to buy poisons, distilled venoms and
acids at cost (\ie no mark-up) from an alchemist.}

\subsubsection{An assassin causes their target increased damage when
attacking through a rear hexside in Melee Combat.}

Increase the damage caused by a blow from an assassin by 1 for every
Rank when they strike their target through a rear hex in Melee Combat.

\subsubsection{An assassin increases their chance of knocking out a
target.}

An assassin may attempt to automatically knockout a target when using
a sap.  They must make a successful strike while attacking from behind
or surprise against an unhelmeted opponent.

In addition their chance of knocking out a target (see
\S\ref{combat:attacking}) with a sap is increased by 2\% for each Rank
they have achieved in assassin.

\subsubsection{An assassin increases their chance of performing any action
involving stealth.}

\index{stealth!assassin}

An assassin increases stealth (see \S\ref{stealth}) by 2\% per Rank
they have achieved with the ability.
