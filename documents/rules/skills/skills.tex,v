% \section{Introduction to Skills}
\label{skills}
\index{skills|(}
\index{skills!introduction}

A character may acquire and refine skills during a campaign.  They can
hone their talents in a series of interrelated non-magical and
quasi-magical abilities, which combine to form a single skill.  A
character's degree of talent is measured by their Rank in a skill.
They begin with the simplest abilities at the lowest Ranks, and gain
the more difficult ones as they progress through the Ranks.  Their
percentage chance of successfully performing tasks associated with a
skill will increase as their Rank becomes higher.

The possession of a skill does not necessary imply any character
traits associated with that skill.

\subsection{Acquiring and Using Skills}
\index{skills!acquiring}
\index{skills!usage}

The rudiments of a skill are learned by dint of hard practice and
diligent study.  A character must spend a good deal of time and effort
before they can use a skill at novice level (Rank 0). The character's
ability with a skill can improve only if they continue to work with it
during and between adventures.

\subsubsection{Any skill may be acquired at Rank 0 at a variable cost
of Experience Points and 8 weeks of game time.}
\index{skills!rank 0}

All eight weeks must fall within a period of six game months.  Time
spent on adventure may not count toward the necessary eight weeks.

\subsubsection{The method by which a character learns a skill affects the
Experience Point cost to acquire that skill or to increase the
character's Rank.}

If the character is taught by someone of greater Rank in the skill,
decrease any Experience Point cost by 10\%.  If the character learns
from a book, verbal descriptions or practices with some of equal or
lesser Rank in the skill, any Experience Point cost is unmodified.  If
the character practices with no useful outside assistance, any
Experience Point cost is increased by 25\%.  The availability of
qualified teachers, and the fees they charge the character for their
services, are left to the discretion of the GM.

\subsubsection{A character may attempt to employ a non-magical skill any
number of times during a day.}

The use of a skill does not, in and of itself, prevent a character
from using the same or any other skill immediately afterwards.
However, a character might suffer adverse fortune (for example, lose
Fatigue Points) while executing a skill, which would inhibit their
ability to act.

\subsubsection{The use of a non-magical skill is rarely automatically
successful.}

A character usually has a chance of failure when using a non-magical
skill.  Unless the ability is described as an exception to this rule,
the maximum chance to succeed with it is never greater than 90 (+
Rank)\% .  A character always fails to use an ability if the roll is
greater than the modified chance or 100 (regardless of Rank).

\subsubsection{Very few of the abilities associated with the various skills
are quasi-magical.}

The following are the only quasi-magical abilities to be found in the
skills section: Alchemist, Astrologer, Healer, Herbalist, Ranger Bump
of North.

\subsubsection{Expert Knowledge}
\index{skills!expert knowledge}

The possessor of a skill, other than an Adventuring skill, also gains
an in-depth knowledge of the field associated with their skill.  This
is equivalent to having Knowledge in that skill (see \S
\ref{skills:knowledge}).

\subsubsection{Supervision of subordinates}
\index{skills!supervision}

The possessor of a Skill, other than an Adventuring skill, is able to
supervise the work of subordinates in that Skill.  The supervisor may
instruct and supervise a number of subordinates equal to Rank.
Subordinates must be practising the same Skill as their supervisor and
may themselves be supervising underlings, thus creating a ``chain of
command''.  A subordinate may be replaced by a work-gang, consisting
of a group of up to 10 labourers, who must be working as a team, and
may not be supervising others. A character need not supervise their
maximum number of subordinates or labourers, and may themselves work,
proportional to their unused supervision capacity.

\begin{example}
A character with Rank 6 in Artisan (Carpenter), may instruct up to 6
other Carpenters or 6 work-gangs (up to 60 labourers), or some
combination thereof.  If they were supervising 2 Carpenters and 1
work-gang, they would only be using half their supervision capacity,
and could themselves work about half of the time.
\end{example}

The possessor of a Skill, other than an Adventuring skill, also gains
an in-depth knowledge of the field associated with their Skill.  The
knowledge held by the character may not be entirely factual, and may
contain certain popular misconceptions or superstitions.  Generally
there is no success percentage, the GM simply giving far more
information regarding a certain topic to a character who has expert
knowledge in that area.  If there is doubt as to whether or not a
character should know something from their specific field, the chance
should be 50\% (+ 5 / Rank), modified by the GM to reflect the rarity
of the knowledge.  This knowledge mostly gives the character a better
understanding of the techniques and tools of their trade, some history
of the trade, a much wider general knowledge about it, and perhaps
some biographical knowledge of famous figures associated with it, both
historical and contemporary.  This knowledge is less thorough than a
similar Sub-field from the Philosopher Skill, and should not be seen
as a substitute for it.

\subsection{Knowledge (area)}
\label{knowledge}
\index{skills!knowledge}

This is a skill that can be taken many times --- once for each area of
knowledge. A character with this skill knows most of the common lore
and traditions concerning their chosen area. An area may include: a
particular city or territory, a culture, an historical period, or a
race, or species. In addition, an area of knowledge may be taken from
the Philosopher skill (q.v.). If this is done, the area is equivalent
in size to a Sub-field, and any Sub-fields except Advanced,
Experimental or Ancient, are available as areas of knowledge.

A character is limited to the knowledge available to their
culture. The knowledge held by the character may not be entirely
factual, and may contain certain popular misconceptions or
superstitions. This skill mostly gives the character a much wider
general knowledge about their area, some history of it, and perhaps
some biographical knowledge of famous figures associated with it, both
historical and contemporary. This skill is entirely one of knowledge,
and confers no special ability to perform a craft or trade.

Generally there is no success percentage, the GM simply giving far
more information regarding a certain topic to a character who has
knowledge of that area.  If there is doubt as to whether or not a
character should know something from their specific area, the Base
Chances are:

\begin{tabular}{lc}
\textbf{Rarity of Information}	& \textbf{Base Chance} \\
Common			& WP + 70\% \\
Uncommon		& WP + 40\% \\
Rare or Obscure		& WP + 10\% \\
\end{tabular}

These chances may be further modified by the GM to reflect the
individual rarity of the knowledge. A character will not know the
theories behind the lore.

If a character learns an area of Knowledge that is also a Philosopher
Sub-field, and that character is, or becomes a Philosopher, the
Knowledge (area) may be used as the appropriate Sub-field.

A character may acquire and refine skills during a campaign.  He can
hone his talents in a series of interrelated non-magical and

skill will increase as his Rank becomes higher.

The skills presented here are only those likely to be used by a
character during an adventure. The fruits of the labours of those using
other, more plebeian, skills may be purchased.  The gamesmaster will
be guided in determining the price (in Silver Pennies) of the various
goods produced by craftsmen by the Basic Goods Cost List (81.4).
Weaponsmiths' products are valued on the Weapons Table (19.3);
Armourers' on the Armour and Shield Tables (17.8 and 17.9).  The three
factors which determine the price of finished goods are the quality of
the material used, the man-hours spent in construction, and the
estimated Rank of the craftsman (if one person produces the goods) or
of the overseer (if the effort is a team project).  However, if a
character wishes to purchase a custom-made or rare item, then he will
have to negotiate with the craftsman (represented by the gamesmaster), and
may defray by providing some of the scarcer components himself.  The
barter system is acceptable when dealing in costly or rare items.

ability with a skill can improve only if he continues to work with
it during and between adventures.

found in the skills section: 50.7, 50.9, all of 52 and 55, 56.3 and
62.6.

\subsubsection{A character must practice any skill he acquires or risk a
decrease in Rank.}

A character must use one game day to fulfill the practice requirement
once a month for one skill. If a character fails to practice a skill
for one month, he may satisfy the practice requirement by the use
of four game days during the following month; if he fails to practice
for two months, eight game days will satisfy the requirement during
the third month of the cycle.  Days of practice during the second
month may count towards the third month requirement.

If a character has not sufficiently practiced a skill by the third
month, his Rank in that skill is decreased by one. If the skill is at
Rank 0, he loses that skill.

{\bf Note:} A character practices his skills of speaking, reading and
writing in a language through conversation and correspondence; it
should be assumed that he is able to do this independent of his other
practices.
