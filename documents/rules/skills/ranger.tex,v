@\begin{skill}{Ranger}{2.1}{ranger}

Rangers are trained to survive, and perhaps thrive, in wilderness.
They can feed themselves, shelter from the elements, choose the best
way to travel and identify natural dangers.  Rangers' general training
is useful in any outdoors environment but they benefit further from
learning the specifics of particular environments.

\subsection{Benefits}

\subsubsection{Primary Environment}

A ranger knows far more about the environment with which they are most
familiar. While in this primary environment the ranger's base
chances and formulas should be calculated as if they were 2 Ranks
higher.  A ranger's initial primary environment is that in which
they learnt the skill. A ranger may later chose to change their
primary environment during ranking.

The ranger must train in the new environment, the ranking time is
increased by 1 week and the EP cost for this rank is increased by 50\%
(to maximum of +3000 EP). To return to a previously learnt primary
environment the ranger must spend 500 EP and 2 weeks in the
environment.  After rank 10 a ranger may learn a new environment by
training for 4 weeks in the new environment and spending 3000 EP.

\subsubsection{Stealth bonus}

While using any of the abilities in this skill a ranger gains a bonus
to stealth of + 3 / Rank.  No other skill bonuses to stealth may be
applied at the same time as this bonus.

\subsubsection{Finding Food}

\begin{Description}
\item[Foraging]

A ranger knows how to find water, edible plants, and animals suitable
for the pot. Foraging includes finding plants, setting snares, hunting
small animals, fishing etc. Snares should be left overnight (or even
days) to be successful.  A ranger does not need to make an attack roll
but may automatically kill small animals that were caught during
foraging.

In an average area in one hour a ranger can find enough food to feed
one person for a day (+ 30 minutes per extra person).  The volume of
food available is dependant on fertility and season so the GM should
adjust the time to suit the environment.  If a ranger wants to hunt
larger animals they should use the Tracking ability to locate game and
then use an appropriate hunting weapon to kill it (\ie ranged weapons,
spear).  If they make a successful attack then their quarry is
immediately killed.  If they miss the animal will flee. If a ranger is
hunting predators, extremely large animals or sentients they must use
the combat rules to kill their quarry.  A ranger and mechanician may
combine their abilities to build and conceal large traps, pit falls,
etc at the GM's discretion.

\item[Identify and Find Plants and Animals]

A ranger can recognise common plants and animals.  They have a
(Perception + 10 / Rank)\% chance of resolving whether a strange plant
or animal is suitable for food. If they roll 10\% or less than their
success chance they may also notice other properties of the item
(\eg poisonous, valuable etc).

A ranger can identify the types of entities living in an area from the
traces they leave behind (tracks, game paths, grazing signs, prey
remains etc).  This takes about 15 minutes and gives them an idea of
the variety of animals in the area (\eg the primary carnivore is a
wolf pack; there is a large herd of red deer, and a flock of pigeons).

A ranger may search for a specific plant or animal (including herbs
required in the First Aid ability), provided it is native to the
region.  The base chance is 2 \x PC + 5 / Rank (- 0 if common, - 25 if
uncommon and -75 if rare).  This roll should be made once per hour
of searching.

\item[Tracking]

A ranger can follow the tracks left by entities moving on the ground.
In calm weather, tracks normally last around 10 days but the clarity
and duration of tracks will be enhanced by the number of entities, or
soft ground, and reduced by hard ground, rough weather, or if the
entity is trying to hide their tracks.  The base chance of following
tracks is Perception (+ 5 / Rank) (+2 / entity in group) (- 4 / Rank
of quarry's ability to hide tracks).  If a ranger is following a fresh
track they will be aware when they are close enough to be detected.
They may then use stealth to sneak up on their quarry and they will be
able to get 25\% closer than a non-ranger before there is a
possibility of being detected.
\end{Description}

\subsubsection{Camping}

\begin{Description}
\item[Preparing Food]

A ranger knows how to get a fire going, gut and skin animals, and cook
simple meals over an open fire.

\item[Campsites]

A ranger knows where to set up camp so that they are sheltered from
the elements, close to water, or other by criteria they may choose
(\eg hidden or defensible).

A ranger can easily erect tents, they can add extra comfort to a
campsite by setting up tarps to protect from wind or water, and they
can take advantage of nearby resources to build a crude shelter.
\end{Description}

\subsubsection{Travelling}

\begin{Description}

\item[Orientation]

A ranger has a sensitivity towards north. They are able to pinpoint
true north to within (10 - Rank) degrees and from this they can work
out the other compass directions.

\item[Map Reading]

A ranger can read a simple map if they can relate their physical
surroundings to the symbols on that map. There are no standard symbols
or keys so interpreting a new map is a challenge of the Ranger's
wits and experience. A ranger may place themselves on a map if they
can determine the direction of two marked landmarks.

\item[Route Finding]

A ranger is rarely lost and can normally back track to a known point.
They learn to recognise landmarks from unfamiliar directions and
estimate the time and effort required to travel through various
terrain.  A ranger can pick a route through unknown terrain based on
ease of travel, speed, stealth, or safety etc.  The base chance of the
ranger picking the best route for their purpose is 2 \x Perception (+5
/ rank)\%.  The roll should be made by the GM and if the ranger fails
then the route travelled should be hard or longer or dangerous as
appropriate.  This roll should only be made once per day.

After a ranger has travelled through an area several times they do not
need to use known routes but can freely take shortcuts or choose
better routes.

\item[Distance Estimates]

A ranger can estimate distance travelled overland to within (90 +
Rank)\% accuracy.
\end{Description}

\subsubsection{Safety}

\begin{Description}

\item[Detect Hidden]

In a natural setting a ranger may notice hidden entities, or recognise
an ambush or trap before they walk into it. The base chance is 3 \x
Perception (+ 5 / Rank) (-5 / Rank of person who did the hiding or set
the ambush or trap).

\item[Hide Tracks]

A ranger can obscure the tracks of 1 (+ 1 / Rank) entities moving in
the same direction.  It takes 30 (- 1 / Rank) minutes to obscure 100
yards of track.  This time may be reduced if the ground is rocky or
naturally hard.

\item[Hide Entities]

A ranger can attempt to hide 1 (+ 1 / Rank) entities in natural cover.
The ease of hiding someone is dependent on the available terrain. The
GM should advise a modifier based on the terrain of 1 (\eg flat open
ground) to 10 (\eg thick bushes or jungle). The base chance of hiding
is (modifier \x Rank) - 5.  (NB this ability does not imply that the
ranger can set up ambushes).

\item[First aid]

A ranger knows simple first aid to prevent minor accidents in the wilderness becoming severe.  The know how to:
\begin{Itemize}
\item Stop external bleeding
\item Splint broken bones
\item Treat minor burns
\item Recognise the effects of common natural poisons
\end{Itemize}
They also know how to brew tisanes (herbal teas) which help reduce the
effects of headaches, nausea, fevers and food poisoning.  To make
tisanes the ranger requires fresh common herbs (which have been picked
within 24 hours of use).

The First Aid abilities cannot be used in combat.
\end{Description}

\subsection{Environments}
\label{ranger:speciality}

The environments a ranger may chose as their primary environment are
dominated by similarities of climate, terrain and fertility.  These
environments cover lightly populated areas eg. open farmland, moors,
but do not include towns, cities, etc.  Some environments overlap.

\begin{Description}
\item[Arctic]

Includes tundra, steppes, permafrost and ice caps and other infertile lowlands in cold climates.  
Fertility: Infertile, Seasons: standard, note that winter has no daylight \& summer has no night time.

\item[Caverns]

Includes all caves, tunnels, natural caverns, and other substantial underground areas.
Fertility: Infertile, Seasons: always low season.

\item[Coastal]

Includes land adjacent to saltwater, estuaries, coastal marshes etc.
Fertility: Average or poor, Seasons: standard.

\item[Highlands]

Includes hills and mountains, moors, high plateaus.  Also includes
evergreen forests on steep ground.  These areas are fertile in summer
but snow or ice covered and hostile in winter.  Fertility: Poor,
Seasons: standard.

\item[Jungle]

Includes hot climate forests of any sort.  They are particularly
characterised by heavy undergrowth and high rainfall.  Fertility:
Rich, Seasons: wet/dry.

\item[Plains]

Includes grasslands, plains, pampas, savannah, prairie, veldt, and
other more or less open and flat or rolling terrain.  May include low
hills where the land is open and not wooded.  Fertility: Poor,
Seasons: standard.

\item[Rural]

Generally mild climate cultivated terrain, lightly inhabited.
Includes cultivated fields, grazing lands, vineyards, heaths, etc.
Fertility: Average, Seasons: standard.

\item[Waste]

Includes all deserts, wastelands, salt flats, and other infertile
lowlands in mild to hot climates.  Fertility: Infertile, Seasons:
Reversed in hot regions as the most fertile period is autumn and the
least fertile summer.

\item[Wetlands (freshwater)]

Includes marshes \& swamps, and land adjacent to freshwater rivers,
lakes \& ponds, etc.  Fertility: Rich, Seasons: standard.

\item[Woods]

Includes mild climate deciduous and evergreen forests or large wooded
areas with few sentient inhabitants, in mild to cold climates.
Fertility: Average, Seasons: standard.

A few hardy souls, known as rangers, are trained to survive unequipped
in wilderness environments.  A ranger develops an instinctive sense of
direction.  They will become extremely sensitive to signs of
instrusion by humanoids, and so will become an expert at tracking and
recognising ambushes.  The ranger is knowledgable in herbalist lore,
which allows them to distinguish the properties of plants.  A ranger
will become comfortable with one particular environment, and will
operate best there.
d11 1
a11 95
\subsubsection{A Ranger can read a simple map if they can relate their
physical surroundings to the symbols on that map.}
\index{maps!reading}

Interpreting each new map is a challenge of the Ranger's wits and
experience. If a character does not have a map-reading skill, they may
not read maps.

A Ranger may place themselves on a map if they can determine the
direction of two marked landmarks.

\subsubsection{A ranger acquires a ``bump'' of direction as they
increase their Rank.}

A ranger instinctively knows the relationship of each of the cardinal
directions (of the compass) to each other.  They are able to pinpoint
true north to within (10 - Rank) degrees.  A ranger can also estimate
distance travelled overland to within (90 + Rank)\% accuracy.  The
maximum amount of travel which can be estimated by a ranger is (1 +
Rank) consecutive weeks' worth.  A check must be made to determine the
accuracy of the Ranger's estimate each time they reach their time
limit.  Both the above rules are exceptions to the maximum success
change of (90 + Rank)\% rule.

If a ranger is lost or wishes to travel out of a wilderland by a
direction other than that by which they came, their success percentage
to discover the shortest route out is (2 \x Perception + 7 \x Rank)\%.
The GM rolls percentile dice, and if the roll is equal to or less than
the success percentage, the ranger character chooses the quickest
route.  If the roll is between one and two times the success
percentage, the ranger is unsure of which direction to go, and may
check again in (12 - Rank) hours.  If the roll is equal to or greater
than twice the success percentage, the ranger has decided upon a
random direction as the best.

\subsubsection{A ranger can sometimes recognise an ambush in a natural
setting before they (or a fellow party member) blunders into it.}
\index{detect ambush!ranger}

A ranger has a (3 \x Perception + 5 \x Rank)\% chance to detect an
ambush or trap before they step into it.  Subtract 5\% per Rank of the
thief or ranger who set the trap or ambush from the success
percentage.

\subsubsection{A ranger can attempt to track the progress of land bound
beings through certain types of terrain.}

A ranger may only try to track somebody through terrain which will
show traces of passage.  For example, a human in armour can be tracked
through underbrush, but not across a mountain normally.

A ranger's success percentage to track, assuming that their quarry has
attempted to obscure signs of their passage, is (Perception + 6
\x Rank)\%.  The percentage is doubled if the quarry did not
attempt to cover their tracks; it is decreased by four times the Rank
of a ranger who used their craft in covering the tracks.  If the GM's
roll on percentile dice is equal to or less than the success
percentage, the ranger may track their quarry as far as the spoor
goes. If the roll is greater than the success percentage, the ranger
loses the trail an appreciable distance before they could run their
quarry to ground.

If a quarry's tracks can weather the passage of time, a ranger may
trace tracks of up to (2 + Rank Squared) days ago.

\subsubsection{A ranger can usually recognise the effect a particular
plant or animal product will have upon a humanoid.}

A ranger can always recognise a common animal or plant product (\eg
pine cones, deer meat).  When a ranger tries to determine the use of a
less common animal or plant product, their success percentage is equal
to (Perception + 10 \x Rank)\%.  If the GM's roll on percentile dice
is equal to or less than the success percentage, the ranger discovers
the properties of the substance under analysis.  If the roll is
between one and two times the success percentage, the ranger is unsure
of the substance's use.  If the roll is equal to or greater than twice
the success percentage, the ranger mistakenly identifies the substance
as something else which it could appear to be.

\subsubsection{A ranger can forage for curative plants in a woods
habitat.}

If a ranger spends a full day (about 12 hours) foraging in a woods
area, they may do one of the following:

\begin{Enumerate}
\item   Cure disease
\item   Cure fever
\item   Salve skin irritations
\item   Restore lost Endurance Points
\end{Enumerate}

The herbs gathered by the ranger will, when applied to a patient for
(12 - Rank) minutes, cure as if the ranger were a healer of same Rank
(see \S\ref{healer:cure}).

a152 2
\subsubsection{A ranger can specialise in one particular environment.}
\label{ranger:speciality}
d154 1
a154 4
When a ranger achieves Rank 2, they may choose one of the environments
listed below as their speciality.  When a ranger performs an ability
in the environment of their speciality, they add (2 \x Rank)\% to
their success percentage.

A ranger may not specialise in more than one environment.

speciality.}

The herbs gathered by the ranger will, when he applies them to his
patient for (12 - Rank) minutes, cure as if he were a healer of his

When a ranger achieves Rank 2, he may choose one of the environments

A ranger instinctively knows the relationship of each of the
cardinal directions (of the compass) to each other.  He is able to
pinpoint true north to within (10 - Rank) degrees.  A ranger can
also estimate the distance he has travelled overland to within (90 +
Rank)\% accuracy.  The maximum amount of travel which can be
estimated by a ranger is (1 + Rank) consecutive weeks' worth (see
83.4).  A check must be made to determine the accuracy of the Ranger's
estimate each time he reaches his time limit.  Both the above rules
are exceptions to rule 48.4.
