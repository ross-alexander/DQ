\begin{skill*}{Warrior}{2.0}{warrior}

Warriors practice the art of melee combat until it becomes a series of
finely honed instincts.  They practise on all terrains with all types
of weapons against different configurations and tactics, so that they
may always respond optimally with the need for thought.  Unlike most
professions that impart knowledge through practise and theory, the
warrior skill is all about practise for its own sake.

The discipline and training regime associated with warrior training is
often liked to ethical codes such as chivalry, and training is often
only available after indoctrination to a code.  This is unsurprising,
as a warrior gains no advantage unless facing an active opponent.
While there is no reason why a warrior should not also be an assassin,
as a warrior becomes more skilled, their training and instincts will
push them towards fair combat.

\subsection{Restrictions}

\subsubsection{Benefits only apply when the warrior is occupying an
enemy's melee zone.}

\subsubsection{A warrior may never train in the warrior skill without a
training partner of at least equal warrior Rank.}

A warrior needs a training partner of at least their current skill
level in order to practice combat, they cannot practice on their own.

\subsubsection{A warrior requires various minimum weapons skills per Rank.}

Before being able to achieve any new Rank in the warrior skill, a
character must first have achieved a certain standard of weapon
proficiency, with a variety of weapons.  Firstly a warrior must have
at least Rank 4 with a weapon rated for close combat.  Secondly a
warrior must achieve the Ranks summarised in the attached table.

\subsection{Benefits}

\subsubsection{A warrior gains a bonus to defence when facing an
opponent wielding a weapon they are familiar with.}

When facing a weapon, which is from a category in which the warrior
has Ranks, the warrior gains a bonus to their defence of either (2 +
4\% per Rank of the highest Ranked weapon the warrior has in the
category) or (2 + 2\% per warrior Rank), whichever is lower.

\subsubsection{A warrior gains + 1 / Rank to their engaged initiative.}

No bonus is gained at Rank 0.

\subsubsection{A warrior has the ability to wield weapons which are
similar to other weapons with which they is familiar.}

A warrior may use any weapon from a category in which they have Ranks
at half the Rank of their maximum Ranked weapon in that category or at
half their warrior Rank, whichever is lower.

\subsubsection{A warrior gains the ability to Rank weapons without the
need for a tutor.}

A warrior is able to Rank a weapon without a tutor from a category in
which they already have Ranked weapons, for an additional 10\% EP
cost, as long as the Rank they are attaining is not greater than their
highest Ranked weapon in that category.  When attempting to attain
higher Ranks or Rank with a weapon from a category in which they do
not have Ranks in, a warrior must expend 25\% more experience to Rank
a weapon without a tutor.

\subsubsection{A warrior's base chance to hit is increased by 1\% + 1\%
additional per Rank.}

A warrior also inflicts an extra point of damage at Ranks 5 \& 10, and
gains a bonus of +1 at Ranks 4 \& 8 to the parry calculation.

\subsubsection{A warrior becomes an expert in combat equipment.}

A warrior is treated as a merchant of their warrior Rank when
attempting to buy or value non-magical weapons (including shields),
with which they are familiar. If they have a passing familiarity with
the weapon (\ie has Ranks in the same category but not the actual
weapon) they will act as a merchant of half their warrior Rank.  If
they are completely unfamiliar with the equipment they may not use
this ability.
