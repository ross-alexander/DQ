@\begin{skill}{Languages}{2.0}{languages}

The campaign has many languages. Each sentient race usually has one
intrinsic to itself, or more if that race is split into various
populations. There is no universal language, but Common is the first
language of several nations.

\subsection{Restrictions}

A language may not be known above its maximum rank. Characters may not
speak a tongue for which they do not have the vocal apparatus.
Characters may not learn a language without instruction from a source
of at least the same rank as that being learnt.

\subsection{Structure}

\begin{Description}

\item[Family] Each Language belongs to one particular Family of
intrinsically related tongues (see \S\ref{languages:families}).

\item[Language Group] History, geography, and custom all transform
languages --- therefore languages with a common history or interaction
share the same Language Group (see \S\ref{languages:groups}). A
language may belong to several groups, and a group may link languages
from different Families.

\end{Description}

Learning a language is easier if one already knows a related or similar
language at a higher rank. The EP discount is:
\begin{Itemize}

\item 20\% if in the same Family or Group;

\item 30\% if in both the same Group and the same Family. 
\end{Itemize}

\subsection{Benefits}

Languages vary in their complexity; a low maximum rank may indicates
less versatility, vocabulary, or foreignisms.

At Rank 0 in a language, you cannot speak it, but can probably sense
the general mood of plain statements: a threat, a greeting, etc.
Thereafter, with increasing rank, one's competency and vocabulary
progressively increase, as compared to humans, using a typical human
language, to talk about every-day things in their village.

\begin{Description}

\item[Rank] Effect (\& approximate Vocabulary).

\item[1] Some of the simple, common words (2\%).

\item[2] A few simple statements (5\%).

\item[3] Common phrases, including basic directions; several tenses;
Effectively rank 0 in all other languages of that Group (20\%).

\item[4] Common idioms; more tenses; can give passable descriptions of
events or people; Effectively rank 0 in all other languages of the
same Family (70\%).

\item[5] Rarer idioms; most tenses; sufficient to use most professional skills (90\%).

\item[6] Normal, every-day fluency \& usage; can give clear \&
accurate descriptions of events or people; Effectively rank 1 in all
other languages of that Group (100\%).

\item[7] Courtly or professional speaker (120+\%).

\item[8] Can express any conceivable thought; may cast college magic;
Effectively rank 1 in all others of the same Family (200+\%).

\item[9] Effectively rank 2 in all other languages of that Group (400+\%).

\item[10] Maximum mastery of the language (500+\%).

\end{Description}

Note that some languages are very limited. For example, many concepts
or emotions cannot be articulated in Troll.

\subsection{Literacy}

Literacy in a language is distinct from the skill of speaking. It is
easily learnt if the written form is alphabetic. Most cultures have a
large proportion of the population that is illiterate.

Not all languages have a written form. It is not possible to attain
literacy in a language that does not have an established written
form. One may attempt to transcribe that language, adapting a known
script, but the ``writing'' produced is ineffectual for communicating
with others.

\subsubsection{Phonetic Reading \& Writing}

Most Alusian languages are written using a phonetic alphabet: a set of
signs representing, one-to-one, all the sounds of that language.
Historically, a recently literate language usually re-uses an
established alphabet with minor variations. Therefore there are many
languages, but few alphabets.

For each alphabet, the cost is 1000 EP and 4 weeks the first time you
learn literacy using it; literacy in a subsequent language, using the
same alphabet, is only 500 EP and 2 weeks. Sometimes, for different
cultures, one language is written in different phonetic alphabets. If
so, you must pay the time and EP for each one you learn.

\subsubsection{Table of known Alusian alphabets}
\label{languages:scripts}
\begin{Description}
\item[b] Bedouin script (human, flowing, cursive).

\item[d] Drakonic.

\item[e] Elvish script.

\item[i] Island (used near the land-locked ocean).

\item[k] Kingdom (used near  the Azurian Empire).

\item[n] Nagan (elaborate, but versatile).

\item[o] Ogham (human, rune-like).

\item[r] Dwarvish runes.

\item[w] Westron (usual Western human alphabet; also adopted by many
newly literate societies).


\end{Description}

\subsubsection{Orthographic languages}

A literate language not using a truly phonetic alphabet is
orthographic --- \eg it uses pictograms, or an elaborate spelling
structure. The written form is so complex that it must be learned as
if it were, in effect, another language of the same language family
(\eg written and spoken Erehleine are treated as two separate members
of the Eldar Family). Hence one often speaks and writes an
orthographic language at different ranks. Orthographic languages are
indicated in \S\ref{languages:families} by an asterisk (*). Each
orthographic system is functionally unique to its particular language.

\subsection{Special rules}

\begin{Description}

\item[Common] is easily learnt. Knowledge of any other language at a
higher rank gives a 50\% EP discount.

\item[Accent] Every speaker has an accent which reflects a mixture of
their native language and the tutors from whom one learnt the
language.  At Rank 6 or higher, any speaker may gain a particular
accent by spending 500 EP and 1--3 weeks study or being tutored (the
GM decrees how much time is necessary).

\item[Unpronounceable Tongues] all languages of the Dragon Family
(except Saurime) require unusual vocal apparatus. No humanoid race may
normally speak these tongues. However, you may rank the language at
twice normal cost, to gain comprehension. Alphabetic literacy in an
unpronounceable language costs 2000 EP and 8 weeks. If you do have the
physiological or magical ability to speak such languages, you may rank
them without penalty.

\item[Immersion] If character spends a number of weeks listening to a
particular language being spoken daily and frequently by speakers who
use it at a rank higher than the character knows it, the GM may allow
that character to use those weeks as ranking time for that language in
addition to any other activity undertaken \eg going on adventure,
other training, etc. The EP must still be paid. A character may only
rank one language by immersion at any one time.

\item[New languages] when a new language is introduced into the
campaign, the GM concerned must determine the following:
\begin{Enumerate}
\item Its Family and any language groups. 

\item Whether it has a written form --- and, if so, is it phonetic or
orthographic? If it is alphabetic, what alphabet is used?

\item Its maximum rank. 
\end{Enumerate}
\end{Description}


\subsection{Language Families}
\label{languages:families}


The figure in [ ] represent the maximum rank that can be achieved with
the language; the letter(s) represent the phonetic alphabet(s) used,
and * identifies orthographic languages. If no letter or asterisk is
given, the language does not have an established written form.

\begin{skill}{Languages}{1.2}{languages}
d3 4
a6 7
There are many languages and dialects in the world.  Each sentient
species has at least one language intrinsic to itself, and frequently
more if it has culturally or geographically separated populations.
There is no totally universal language; however, \emph{Common}, which
is the first language of several human nations, is also used as a
lingua franca by some members of most species, especially in
interracial conversations.  Common is also called the trade tongue.
a7 7
A language usually has other related tongues which it sometimes
resembles, principally in the vocabulary and grammar, but often in
underlying racial concepts as well.  A speaker usually finds it easier
to learn a related language than an unrelated one. The families into
which languages are grouped are listed in the Language Table
(\ref{languages:table}).

d10 4
a13 2
\subsubsection{A character must spend Experience Points, time and
perhaps money to increase Rank in a language.}
d15 1
a15 10
Normally it takes 1 week of training to reach Rank 0, and 2 \x (Rank
to be achieved) weeks to improve.  However, it takes only 1 \x (Rank
to be achieved) weeks of training and half the listed experience to
improve in any tongue when the character speaks some other tongue of
the same language family at a higher Rank.  If one is Rank 3 in a
tongue one is automatically Rank 0 in all other tongues of the same
Language family.  Common belongs to no particular Language family, but
it is easily learnt, taking only 1 \x (Rank to be achieved) weeks of
training and half the listed experience to improve if the character
speaks any other tongue at a higher Rank.
d17 1
a17 2
\subsubsection{Literacy in a language is a separate ability from the
skill of speaking that language.}
d19 2
a20 7
Many cultures have some social classes or professions (frequently most
of the population) that are illiterate.  The written forms of most
languages are alphabetical and essential phonetic. A few languages are
not written in character-based form, or the equivalent.  In such a
case, the written form of the tongue is so complex that it must be
learned as if it certain essential were another language of the same
language family, \eg Erelhein.
d22 5
a26 3
Sometimes the same language is customarily written in different
alphabets by differing cultures.  The identified alphabets are listed
below.
d28 22
a49 1
\textbf{Class}\hspace{1.0cm}\textbf{Alphabet}
d51 29
a79 12
\item[b] Bedouin script (human, cursive)
\item[d] Drakonic
\item[e] ``Elvish'' script
\item[i] Island (used in and around the land-locked ocean)
\item[k] Kingdom (used in the Azurian Empire and satellite nations)
\item[n] Nagan (elaborate, but versatile)
\item[o] Ogham (human, rune-like)
\item[r] Dwarvish runes
\item[w] ``Standard'' Western (used by most Common speakers in the
West; has also been adopted and adapted by many newly literate
societies)
\item[*] Language is written in characters.
d82 2
a83 7
It takes 4 weeks and 1000 EP to be literate in any one form of any
language although it will take only 2 weeks and only 500 EP to be
literate in any one form of any one language if the character is
either literate in some other form of the language and/or is literate
in some different language which uses an almost identical alphabet.
When one is literate in a language, one writes and reads comparatively
as well as one speaks it.
d85 1
a85 1
\subsubsection{Not all languages have a written form.}
d87 3
a89 4
It is not possible to attain literacy in languages that do not have a
written form.  This is not to say that they may not be represented in
a phonetic form in a language in which the character has literacy, but
this is of no value in communication.
d91 5
a95 1
\subsubsection{Not all languages have the same complexity.}
d97 1
a97 3
That is, not all languages have the same maximum rank because not all
languages need the same degree of versatility and vocabulary.  For
example, only player characters' racial tongues go to rank 10.
d99 5
a103 4
For any language with a maximum rank of 8 or less, maximum rank
represents native fluency, (maximum - 1) rank represent, fluency
with a foreign accent, and rank 0 represents only a limited grasp of
some of the basics.
d105 5
a109 2
\subsubsection{The ease with which a character can engage in
conversation in a language is guided by their rank in it.}
d111 4
a114 1
The table below is constructed for a language with maximum rank of 10.
d116 1
a116 5
\begin{Enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\item
Possibly understands mutually common simple concepts when slowly
spoken, accompanied by gestures, etc.
d118 1

\item
Can speak, recognise and understand certain essential stock phrases
such as ``Help'', ``Hello, my name is ...'', ``Ein Bier'', etc.
d120 1
a120 2
\item
Knows a wider range of useful phrases and some general vocabulary.
d122 1
a122 3
\item
Can apply some basic grammar to make the limited phrases and
vocabulary more flexible.

a124 3
\item
Can converse (slowly) in a specialised field, \eg in one's merchant
specialities.
d126 1
a126 4
\item
Understands most of the grammar.  Can comprehend anything, provided
the natives speak clearly and they don't mind occasionally rephrasing
themselves.

a128 3
\item
Can converse on any subject, but not fluently. Confused by rare idioms
or other irregularities.
d130 2
a131 3
\item
Is as fluent as a native, but has non-native accent or turn of
phrase.
a132 5
\item
Normal level of native speakers.  Is as fluent as a native and can
pass for one.  Recognises some accents of dialect or style, and can
imitate some of them with varying success.  Immediately understands
all but the most obscure dialects.
d134 1
a134 3
\item
Can imitate several dialects/styles accurately and understands
nuances that natives would not normally be aware of.
d136 1
a136 5
\item
This is maximum mastery - as competent as rank 9 but more dialects are
known.  Can pick up a new dialect/style after only hearing it a brief
while.
\end{Enumerate}

These rules do not apply to Demons or other creatures from the Demonic
planes.

\subsection{Language Table}
\label{languages:table}
The figures in [] represent the maximum rank that can be achieved with
the language.  The letters in [] represent the alphabet(s) used
(sometimes slightly modified).  Note particularly that Common is
sometimes written differently in different areas, although it
essentially sounds the same in all areas.
d152 2
a153 2
Languages are listed in their  family groups, and separate tables list
these groups according to whether or not they have a written form.
d155 5
a159 1
\subsubsection{Languages which have a written form.}
d161 18
a178 1
There are 14 Language Families that have a written form.
d180 6
a185 14
\item Common [10;i,k,w]
\item Western Human [8 to 10; b,i,k,o,w, and * only in rare and archaic circumstances]
\item Eastern Human [8 to 10; often *]
\item Elf [10;e], Erelhein [10;*], Drow [10;e]
\item Merfolk [8 to 10; various],
\item Suarime [8;d], Dragon [10;d]
\item Giantish (6 dialects) [10;w], Titan [9;i]
\item Dryad [6;e], Sylph [6;e], Nymph/Satyr [8;e]
\item Brownie [7;e], Leprechaun [6;e]
\item Fossergrim [6;r], Pixie [7;r]
\item Dwarvish [10;r], Hobbit [10;r] Gnome [9;r]
\item Goblin [8;w], Hobgoblin [8;w] Orc [10;w], Ogre [6;w]
\item Gorgon [6;i], Centaur [8;i]
\item Naga [7;n]
d187 1
a188 1
\subsubsection{Languages which have no written form.}
d190 2
a191 1
There exist Language Families that have no written form.
a192 11
\begin{Enumerate}
\item	Silent Tongue [6]
\item   Sphinx [7]
\item   Direwolf [6]
\item   Sasquatch [3], Yeti [3]
\item   Gargovie [6], Harpy [7]
\item   Gryphon [3]
\item   Pegasus [6], Unicorn [6]
\item   Wyvern [4]
\item   Gnollish [7], Troll [4], Kobold [8]
\end{Enumerate}
d194 4
a197 2
\subsubsection{Only those languages listed in the Language table may be
learned by characters.}
d199 1
a199 5
``Languages'' such as horse, cat, dolphin, etc., are not considered
languages for the purposes of these rules.  This does not preclude the
use of magic in communicating, or special abilities granted by
powerful beings, it simply means that a character may not learn them
in the normal sense.
d201 1
a201 2
\subsubsection{A GM must assign certain characteristics to a new
language when it is introduced.}
d203 3
a205 14
If a new language is to be introduced the GM must determine the
following.
\begin{Enumerate}
\item
Assign a language group.
\item
Determine whether it has a written form (\ie characters can obtain
literacy).
\item
If written, determine whether it is character or phonetically based,
and the alphabet(s) that apply.
\item
The maximum rank.
\end{Enumerate}
d207 3
a209 1
\subsection{Codes / Ciphers}
d211 2
a212 2
\index{codes}
\index{ciphers}
d214 1
a214 5
This language allows a character to create and read codes.  It ranks
as any other language, though rarely are codes employed with a
vocabulary of greater than rank 6.  The time required to create a code
is 1 hour + 1 hour per rank of the code to be created, up to the rank
of the person creating it.
d216 3
a218 8
The character may attempt to break codes with which they are
unfamiliar.  The Base Chance of successfully doing this is
(A + B - C) \x 5\%, where -
\begin{flushleft}
A = 3 \x sum of ranks employed on the job \\
B = 2 \x days of study \\
C = 4 \x rank of code \\
\end{flushleft}
d220 2
a221 4
The minimum time that can be used to break a code is 24 hours minus
the average rank of the code-breakers, unless they have the code key
(for example a book from which the code is derived) in which case the
BC is improved by 20\% and the minimum time halved.

There is no totally universal language; however,
\emph{common}, which is the first language of several human nations,
is also used as a lingua franca by some members of most species,
especially in interracial conversations.  Common is also called the
trade tongue.

perhaps money to increase rank in a language.}

Normally it takes 1 week of training to reach Rank 0, and 2 \x (rank to
be achieved) weeks to improve.  However, it takes only 1 \x (rank to be
achieved) weeks of training and half the listed experience to improve
in any tongue when the character speaks some other tongue of the same
language family at a higher rank.  If one is Rank 3 in a tongue one is
automatically Rank 0 in all other tongues of the same Language family.
Common belongs to no particular Language family, but it is easily
learnt, taking only 1 \x (rank to be achieved) weeks of training and
half the listed experience to improve if the character speaks any
other tongue at a higher rank.
