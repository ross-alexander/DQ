@\begin{skill}{Astrologer}{1.0}{astrologer}

The celestial bodies have a definite, if not entirely understood,
effect upon the lives of the inhabitants of a DragonQuest world.
These Great Powers seem to impose predestination upon all but the
strong-willed, and determine the aspect of each being.  The Sun, the
Moon, and the Planets regularly cause perturbations in the flow of
mana; the mighty Stars affect a world across the vast reaches of space
by their positions relative to it.  The study of the purpose and
method of the Powers is the science of astrology.

An astrologer's main talent is a limited ability to predict and shape
the future.  An astrologer will be able to make clear, general
assertions, but will only be able to give obscure clues when asked for
specific details.

\subsection{Restrictions}

An astrologer must be able to read and write in one language at Rank 8
if they wish to advance beyond Rank 0.

\subsubsection{An astrologer may not make a general prediction or ask a
specific question concerning only themself.}

One must consult another astrologer in these weighty matters.

\subsubsection{An astrologer may only try once to answer a particular
question or to forecast the outcome of an event.}

Once an astrologer has made a reading (\ie a determination about the
future), they may not seek to change or influence the reading through
their art. Other astrologers who attempt to read the same future will
receive the same information that the first astrologer did.  A second
astrologer may, however, receive some clarification about the first's
reading.

\subsubsection{The results of a reading will affect the pertinent course
of events.}

The GM is expected to modify the outcome of an adventure or happening
in their world to conform with a determination made by an astrologer or
by an astrologer at the behest of a character.  The determination does
not preclude the characters' actions from affecting the outcome of the
adventure or event: to the contrary, the GM must interpret the reading
as they see fit, and alter a few of the random dice-rolls engendered
by the characters' actions accordingly.

A prophecy cannot be avoided by the affected character(s) changing
they plans.  The doom (which may be good) will follow them to the
undertaking they substitute for that which was predicted. However, if
a character asks a specific question predicated upon a given action,
the prophecy will not come to pass unless and until that action is
taken.

\subsection{Benefits}

\subsubsection{An astrologer's Rank determines how many beings they can
directly affect with a single prediction.}

A being is directly affected by an astrologer's art when the GM
modifies the result of an action taken by the being due to a prophecy.

An astrologer can directly affect up to (5 + 10 \x Rank) beings with a
single prophecy.  If an astrologer attempts a prediction which would
directly affect more beings than their Rank allows, they receive no
answer.

\subsubsection{An astrologer may make (and possibly modify) a general
prediction during a reading.}

When an astrologer wishes to make a general prediction about a
particular venture or being, the player (or the GM) actually uses a
divinatory technique at their disposal.  Such a technique could be
reading the tarot, casting the I Ching, or any mutually agreed upon
method.

The result of the divination becomes the astrologer's prediction. If
the astrologer does not wish to make the prediction, they may
immediately attempt to change it.  The GM rolls percentile dice, and
if the roll is less than or equal to (5 \x Willpower + 4
\x Rank - 30), the astrologer makes a second divination (which
may not be changed).  If the roll is greater than the success
percentage, the astrologer is stuck with their first prediction.

\subsubsection{An astrologer may seek to answer up to Rank specific
questions per month.}

When a being poses a specific question to an astrologer willing to
attempt an answer, the GM rolls percentile dice.  If the roll is equal
to or less than (6 \x Astrologer's Rank + 4 \x Astrologer's
Perception), the astrologer is able to give a correct answer. If the
roll is greater than the success percentage, they mutter meaningless
gibberish.

All answers given to specific questions must be, at the very least,
obscure.  The GM may respond with cryptic poetry, much like the Oracle
at Delphi, or may choose to have the astrologer supply a riddle
(though the Player of the astrologer does not know the answer
themself).

\subsubsection{An astrologer can determine the aspect of a being after
observing them.}
 
After an astrologer has spent (60 - Astrologer's Rank) consecutive
minutes observing a being, the GM informs the astrologer of the
being's aspect.

\subsubsection{An astrologer expends Fatigue points when practicing their art.}

\begin{tabular}{@@{}l@@{\hspace{1.0em}}c@@{}}
\textbf{Action}			& \textbf{Fatigue} \\
Make general prediction		& 10 \\
Try to change general prediction & 10 \\
Try to answer specific question & 17 \\
Determine being's aspect	& 5 \\
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{An astrologer must spend [260 + 200 \x Rank] Silver

An astrologer who does not meet his expenses operates as if he were
two Ranks less proficient.  If his Rank is reduced to a negative
number, he may not practice astrology.
