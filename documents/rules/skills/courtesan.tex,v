@\begin{skill}{Courtier}{2.0}{courtier}

A courtier may be an attendant at and frequenter of courts and
palaces, or merely a most civilised student of polished and refined
manners. Courtiers learn to survive in the Machiavellian political
situation prevalent in most courts and places of high estate, and to
be obsequious and intimidating by turns. They may learn musical or
creative skills to enhance their status, and may indulge in
manipulation and seduction.

\subsection{Restrictions}

A courtier must pay an additional 10\% EP to increase their rank if:
\begin{Itemize}
\item Their AG is less than 12;
\item their PB is less than 15.
\end{Itemize}
A courtier pays 10\% less EP to increase their rank if:
\begin{Itemize}
\item Their AG is more than 22;
\item their PB is more than 20.
\end{Itemize}
All modifiers are cumulative.

\subsection{Benefits}

A courtier gains 2 abilities at Rank 0, and 1 further ability per
Rank. All abilities are usually performed at the overall Rank of the
courtier.  However, a courtier may choose to specialise. If, upon
gaining a new Rank, the courtier wishes to forego gaining a new
ability, they may specialise in one of the abilities that they already
possess.  That ability then operates at (courtier's Rank + 1), maximum
10. A courtier may specialise more than once with the same ability,
gaining Rank + 2, Rank + 3, etc. Additional abilities may be gained
after achieving Rank 10, by the expenditure of 500 Experience Points
and 2 weeks of training. Individual Base Chances are not provided for
the various courtier skills; rather there is a generic Base Chance of
3 \x appropriate characteristic (+ 5 / Rank), modified by the GM to
reflect the difficulty of the feat being attempted.

The abilities available to a courtier are:

\begin{Description}

\item[Bureaucracy] an understanding of organisations and hierarchies,
how to get information, which wheels to oil, and which palms to
grease.

\item[Carousing] the ability to socialise informally with persons of
all social classes, without being seen as an outsider. Also includes
the ability to drink considerably less than most observers would
think.

\item[Dress sense] the knowledge of what to wear, how to wear it, and
when.  This skill includes dressing formally, seductively, or
ridiculously as the occasion and culture require. Also includes what
cosmetics and scents to wear, what accessories, and even when to not
wear things.

\item[Entertaining] the ability to organise events, ranging from
intimate parties, to state dinners, grand fetes, and balls. The
courtier may supervise caterers, and menials, arrange the
entertainments, and will know whom not to seat next to the Duke.

\item[Etiquette] the knowledge of what to do, how to do it, and
when. This skill includes courtly graces, correct forms of address,
and which fork to use for the fish. Etiquette must be learnt
separately for different cultures.

\item[Formal dance] a good grounding in formal courtly dances,
particularly suitable for fetes and balls.

\item[Gaming] an understanding of the rules of such recreational
pursuits as backgammon, chess, go, fox-and-geese, nine-men-morris, and
tafl. Also various card and dice games.

\item[Hunting \& Hawking] a familiarity with the practice and styles of
falconry, riding to hounds, and similar courtly sports.

\item[Intimidation] the ability to rule subordinates through terror,
and knowing character flaws and weaknesses. Also includes a good
general grounding in methods of personal manipulation, such as
black-mail.

\item[Oratory] presenting a point of view or a set of information in a
formal and forceful manner, to an audience. Includes rhetoric and
declamation, and also the ability to handle interjection, and
questioning.

\item[Play an instrument] this ability may be taken several times with
different instruments. A Singer is one who has Play Instrument
(Voice). A courtier can usually play similar instruments to the ones
they have chosen at (Rank / 2), and will tend to know mostly formal,
structured music.

\item[Poetry] creating poetry, often of formal and highly complex
structure.

\item[Seduction] (see below).

\item[Simulate emotions] the ability to keep careful check on the
emotions being displayed, so as to deny observers information (such as
when playing poker), or to give false information (feigned surprise,
apparent pleasure).

\end{Description}

\subsection{Seduction}

Whilst seduction may be used to entice an entity who is compatible
with the seducer into a sexual relationship, it may also be used to
create a sense of friendship and trust, even with a being not sexually
compatible with the seducer.  The skill mostly consists of flattery
and gentle coaxing, and a seducer will greatly benefit from being
skilled at etiquette, dress sense, dance, playing music, or whatever
is appropriate to the type of seduction undertaken.  Seduction is not
a rapid skill, requiring hours or even days to achieve the desired
result. Often there is no skill check made since the GM will decide
the results of the seduction based on the character's Rank and the way
the Player describes the attempted seduction.  If a Base Chance is
used, it is seducer's PB (+ 10 / Rank), modified by the GM to reflect
the difficulty of the seduction. If the attempt succeeds the seduction
is generally successful. If the attempt fails but is close to the Base
Chance the seduction may be attempted again, at a later time. A
particularly high roll indicates that the target is unimpressed or
repulsed by the seducer. Player Characters are not bound by the result
of seduction attempted on them, but the GM should give them strong
hints as to how their character feels about the seducer.

\section{Courtesan}
\label{courtesan}
d3 7
a9 19
Courtesanship is a social skill designed expressly to satisfy the
needs of lonely or status conscious people.  A master courtesan will
be an accomplished musician, able to play at least one woodwind or
string instrument.  The master will also be able to sing recite and
compose stories and legends, perform mime, act out skits and dance.
The consummate courtesan is also the master of proper dress, and
attractive appearance and is able to simulate a great range of
emotions.

The abilities attendant to the courtesan skill are usable by such a
character in situations not covered by the following rules, as are
those of the troubadour skill (\S\ref{troubadour}).  The GM should
improvise and allow a courtesan character to use their skill in
appropriate instances. If, for instance, the party is at the mercy of
a homely witch of indeterminate age, a male courtesan should be able
to charm her and at least win his companions' lives if he plays it
right.

A courtier is a male courtesan.
d13 10
a22 17
A courtesan character must pay an additional Experience Point
increment of 10\% to increase their Rank in the skill when:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item   Their Manual Dexterity is less than 12
\item   Their Agility is less than 15
\item   Their Physical Beauty is  less  than  15
\item   They are death-aspected
\end{enumerate}
A courtesan character decreases the Experience Point cost to increase
their Rank by an increment of 10\% when:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item   Their Agility is greater than 22
\item   Their Physical Beauty is greater than 20
\item   They are life-aspected
\end{enumerate}
d27 103
a129 64
\subsubsection{A courtesan acquires one ability per Rank.}

The character begins with one of the following abilities at Rank 0.
All acquired abilities can be performed skillfully.
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item Play a woodwind instrument (e.g., flute)
\item Play a string instrument (e.g., mandolin, lute, etc.)
\item Sing
\item Recite stories and legends
\item Compose stories and legends
\item Perform mime
\item Act out skits
\item Tell jokes
\item Dance
\item Dress well (e.g., formally)
\item Dress seductively
\item Appear attractive (by other culture's standards)
\item Simulate wide range of emotions
\item Imitate accents
\end{enumerate}
A courtesan may gain additional abilities after achieving Rank 10 by
the expenditure of 500 Experience Points per ability.

\subsubsection{A courtesan may attempt to seduce a being with whom the
courtesan is sexually compatible.}

The courtesan must arrange a meeting with their intended paramour,
either alone or with persons who will not interfere while the
courtesan practices their wiles.  The GM rolls percentile dice: the
courtesan's base chance of success is equal to the courtesan's
(Physical Beauty + 10 \x Rank).  The GM then modifies the success
chance, dependent on the feelings and condition of the seductee.

If the roll is equal to or less than the success percentage, the
seductee is infatuated with the courtesan and will retire with the
seductor to a more private place.  If the roll is greater than the
success percentage, the outcome will depend on how great the roll is.
A roll close to the success percentage calls for anything from ``the
body is willing but the spirit needs more convincing'' to polite
refusal, while a high roll can result in anything from mild
embarrassment to the courtesan to violent consequences.  Player
characters are not bound by the result when a courtesan uses their
skill on them.

\subsubsection{A courtesan's fee for services is dependent upon Rank and
gender.}

A courtier will receive (25 + Rank squared) Silver Pennies for a
night's work.  A courtesan will receive (25 + (Rank + 1) squared)
Silver Pennies for the same job.  The distaff side will do better at
this profession in a male-dominated society.  The pay rates are
reversed in a matriarchy.  A courtesan is expected to charge a lower
\emph{per diam} if hired for consecutive evenings.

\subsubsection{A courtesan's social position has peculiar advantages and
disadvantages.}

A master courtesan is equally welcome at a royal ball and at the
lowest dive in town.  At the same time, a courtesan can be prevented
from practicing their skill or imprisoned if the local authorities are
so inclined.  A courtesan should keep in mind that it helps to provide
services at a discount or for free and to bribe the right people to
ensure freedom of action.

Courtesan, and their male counterparts, Couriers, are trained in the
skills needed for the courtly life.  Court life and High Society
involve status and rank, where the forms of dress and behaviour must
be strictly followed if a person wishes to fit in and exert influence.
While a courtesan and troubadour have similar abilities, a troubadour
is more at home with the people, where as a courtesan is at home with
the Lords and Ladies of the land.

A courtesan will be an accomplished musician, able to play at least

\subsection{Costs}

\subsubsection{A courtesan must pay 250 + [350 \x Rank] Silver Pennies
per year for finery and the props of the trade.}

A courtesan who does not spend the above amount operates as if she were
two Ranks less proficient.  If the Rank of a courtesan is reduced to
a negative number, the use of the skill is temporarily lost.  The
above amount does not include extraordinary aids, such as love
philtres, but does include perfumes and other frippery.
