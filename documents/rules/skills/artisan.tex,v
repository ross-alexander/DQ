@\begin{skill}{Artisan}{2.0}{artisan}

craft, trade and service skills may be grouped, as they all function
in a similar manner within the rules. Any, or indeed all of the skills
listed below may be learned, but each is learned and ranked as a

\end{Description}

\subsection{Benefits of Rank}

An Artisan becomes increasingly more effective at their skill as their
rank increases. An artisan may always work at an effective Rank lower
than their true rank. Standard items, as shown on the DQ Equipment
List, are manufactured with an effective Rank of 0.  The artisan
creating the item may have had a higher rank than this, but the skill
used was elementary. Generally, work produced at a higher effective
Rank will appear better, be more aesthetically pleasing, be more
durable, taste better, or result in a higher yield, as appropriate.

\begin{Description}
\item[Applicable base chance]  +1\% / Rank applied.
\item[Applicable characteristic] + 1 / 5 full Ranks applied.
\item[Difficulty modifier] -0.5 / 5 full Ranks applied.
\item[Yield] +5\% / Rank applied.
\end{Description}

These effects are not cumulative, but the effective Rank used may be
spread between these aspects.  The benefits of the improved quality
will only accrue if the Skill (or item created) is used correctly and
in appropriate circumstances.

\begin{example}
A seamstress with Rank 8 in her kkill creates a ball gown at an
effective Rank of 8 for a courtesan.  She must make the gown out of
very high quality cloth (of an appropriate type) and can either create
a gown which confers +8\% on reaction rolls or one that gives +1 PB and
+3\% on reaction rolls, provided that the courtesan wears it both
correctly and in a situation for which it was designed.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
A carpenter with Rank 7 may build a door (to resist the gentle
ministrations of adventurers) that either reduces their chance of
kicking it down by 7\% or is half a difficulty factor harder to kick
in and further reduces their chances by 2\%.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
A Fisher with Rank 10 may catch 150\% (100 + (Rank 10 \x 5\%)) of the
normal amount of fish, in a days fishing.
\end{example}

No more than one Artisan bonus may applied to a specific Base Chance
or Difficulty Modifier, be gained to any one characteristic, or be
added to a Yield. If there is a conflict the better of the bonuses may
be employed.

\begin{example}
If the courtesan in the example above where to wear her Rank 8 (+1 PB,
+3\%) ballgown in conjuntion with the a tiara she had made at Rank 5
that also grants +1 PB, she would still only gain +1 to PB.
\end{example}

If the Skill (or item created) is used incorrectly or in inappropriate
circumstances then no bonus will be gained and negative modifiers may
apply.

\subsection{Time \& Cost}

The time and cost for an artisan to perform their skill is dependant
on the effective Rank used and the Base Time required for that skill.

The Time required is: (Base Time \x ((effective Rank / 2) + 1)).

\begin{example}
If the base time to make a Rank 0 ball gown is 1 week, then an Rank 7
one will take 1 week \x ((7 / 2) + 1) = 4.5 weeks.
\end{example}

The Cost is (80\% of Base Cost \x (effective Rank + 1)) silver
pennies. Note: This is the cost to the artisan, not the sale price.

\subsubsection{Exceptions}

Those Ranks used to gain extra yield do not count in the time
calculation.  Also, half of any Ranks possessed by the artisan above
the rank being used, may be subtracted from the effective Rank in the
time calculation, to a minimum of the base time.

\subsection{Artisan as Merchant}

An artisan is treated as a merchant of half their Rank (rounded down)
when attempting to buy or value equipment or materials with which
someone with their skill would be familiar.

\subsection{Requirements}

An artisan will usually require a workshop, or at least a tool-kit to
perform their skill properly. The cost of tools and basic materials
will vary, but will usually be (100 + (50 \x Rank)) silver pennies. An
artisan may not perform their skill at a higher rank than that of
their workshop or tool kit.

rank increases.  An Artisan may always work at an Effective Rank lower

Rank will appear better, be more aesthetically pleasing, be more
durable, smell better, taste better or whatever as applicable.
Standard items, as shown on the DQ Equipment List are manufactured
with an Effective Rank of 0.  The Artisan creating the item may have
an actual Rank higher than this, but the skill used was elementary.

Every Effective Rank an Artisan skill is performed with allows an
applicable percentile roll to be modified by 1\%.

For every Effective Rank divisible by \emph{five} an applicable
characteristic may be modified by 1 \emph{or} an applicable
difficulty modifier may be altered by 0.5

These benefits are not cumulative (though non-cumulative combinations
are allowable), and will only accrue if the skill (or item created) is
used correctly and in appropriate circumstances.
