@\begin{skill}{Philosopher}{2.0}{philosopher}

Philosophers become familiar with the general characteristics of their
world, within the limits of the knowledge available to their culture,
discarding many popular misconceptions.  They acquire extensive
knowledge on a wide range of subjects, and are, in many ways, the
encyclopaedias and expert opinions of the medieval world.
Philosophers are also well versed in using the unusual and obscure
indexing methods employed in medieval libraries, and so may research
and answer enquiries that they do not immediately know the answers to.

\subsection{Library}

Any place with 50 or more books may be considered a library, for the
purposes of study.  Libraries are rated for the number of days that a
philosopher may study in them to answer any particular question.  This
rating is usually equal to Books divided by 50. Once a philosopher has
exhausted the possibilities of a library they must either find another
and continue their study or attempt to answer the question anyway.  A
day of study is 10 hours, and is full-time work. Some libraries with
specific collections may be rated higher for some Realms than others.
GMs should bear in mind that the books in some libraries will be
predominately in particular languages, and that if the philosopher is
not literate in those languages, the library may be of reduced
usefulness.

\subsection{Requirements}

\subsubsection{Language restriction}

A character may not become a philosopher unless they possess at least
one language at Rank 8, and are literate in that language.

\subsubsection{Books}

A philosopher must possess (or have frequent access to) at least Rank
times 10 books, written in languages that they are literate in.

\subsection{Structure}
\label{philosopher:structure}

The philosopher skill is designed as a tree-like structure, with
several separate Realms of knowledge, each of which has its own
Fields, which in turn, have Sub-fields.

\subsubsection{Realms}

These are the largest and least detailed divisions of knowledge.
There are 5 Realms of knowledge: the Social World, the Material World,
the Magical World, the Animal World, and the Plant World.

\subsubsection{Fields}

Realms are divided into large blocks of knowledge, called Fields.  GMs
should not need to add new Fields to the Realms, but may do so if they
wish.

\subsubsection{Sub-fields}

Small, and quite specific divisions of a Field, these are not limited
to only those suggested below.  A philosopher may learn almost any
sub-division of a Field as a Sub-field, with the GM as the final
arbiter. The most common Sub-fields concern a particular race or area
within a Field.

\subsection{Language benefits}

Philosophers gain a reduction in the EP costs to learn languages, in
addition to any other reductions available to the character.

Provided that the Rank of language being learnt is not greater than
their Rank of philosopher, philosophers may learn to speak the
language or to read an orthographic language at a 10\% discount.  If
the philosopher has chosen the Field of Linguistics, the discount is
20\% instead; increasing to 30\% if the philosopher has chosen the
appropriate Language Group subfield (see
\S\ref{philosopher:structure}).

\subsection{Knowledge benefits}

\subsubsection{Realms}

At Ranks 0, 4, 7, and 10, the philosopher may learn a Realm of
knowledge.  Each Realm provides a thorough grounding in the basics
associated with it (see the individual Realms for more details).  If a
philosopher wishes to forego learning a Realm, they receive an extra 8
Sub-fields (which may be traded for Fields as below).

\subsubsection{Fields \& Sub-fields}

At each Rank above 0, the philosopher receives a number of Sub-fields.
They receive: at Ranks 1 to 4, 3 Sub-fields; at Ranks 5 to 7, 5
Sub-fields; and at Ranks 8 to 10, 7 Sub-fields. 3 Sub-fields may be
traded for 1 Field. Any part of the Sub-field allotment may be
retained and used in conjunction with the allotment received for
further Ranks. Once a philosopher has achieved Rank 10 they may not
Rank their Skill further, but may acquire new areas of knowledge. A
new Realm costs 8 weeks and 4000ep, a new Field 3 weeks and 1500ep,
and a new Sub-field 1 week and 500ep.

\subsubsection{Field restrictions}

A philosopher may not learn a Sub-field if they have not already
learned the Field that it is part of. They may not learn a Field if
they have not already learned the Realm that it is part of.

\subsubsection{Overlaps \& connections}

In some cases it is possible to reach the same Sub-fields by different
routes.  These duplicated Fields may be treated as identical and no
benefit accrues from having the same Sub-field more than once.

\subsection{Research benefits}

Philosophers may attempt to answer questions put to them. These
questions may be posed by themselves, or by other characters. If the
philosopher does not already know the answer, their chance of success
depends on the difficulty of the question and the relevant Realms and
Fields of the philosopher.

\subsubsection{Difficulty}

Questions that may be answered by a philosopher fall into one of seven
categories; Automatic, Very Easy, Easy, Standard, Hard, Very Hard, and
Impossible.  The first step in determining the difficulty of answering
the question is for the GM to determine which Realm(s) the question
pertains to, and the level of difficulty of the question.

A Standard question is one of average difficulty, relative to a given
Realm, as determined by the GM.  They usually deal with a reasonably
large sub-set of the knowledge of the Realm. If the philosopher
possesses the Realm to which the question pertains, but has no more
in-depth knowledge applicable to the question, the difficulty is as
set by the GM. If the philosopher has a Field within that Realm that
the GM determines is relevant to the question, the difficulty
decreases by one step. If the philosopher has a Sub-field within that
Field, and the GM determines that it is relevant to the question, the
difficulty decreases by another step.  If a philosopher does not even
possess the Realm of the question, it becomes two steps harder. A
philosopher will immediately know the answer to an Automatic
question. A philosopher may not answer an Impossible question.

\subsubsection{Answers}

The accuracy of the answer that a philosopher can offer is dependant
on Rank and the difficulty of the question. To increase their
accuracy, a philosopher may also undertake a course of study. For each
study period (the length of which is determined by difficulty), +1\%
is added to the philosopher's Base Chance. A philosopher may, at any
time, attempt to answer the question. The base Accuracy, Rank bonus,
and length of study period is shown on the Answer Table
(\S\ref{skills:philosopher:answer}).

Even though philosophers keep notes during their course of study, an
extended interruption may prove a setback.  If a philosopher ceases a
course of study but resumes it within Rank weeks there are no adverse
effects.  If the interruption is longer than this then half of the
percentage amount that they had achieved from study is lost.

\subsubsection{Final result}

If the question is of a yes/no nature, the Accuracy is the Base Chance
that the philosopher will arrive at the correct answer.  If the
question is more open, the Accuracy is the amount of relevant
information that the philosopher will come up with. It is also
possible that some questions (as determined by the GM) are simply
unanswerable.  If this is the case, the Accuracy becomes the Base
Chance that the philosopher will become aware of this fact.

\subsection{Realms \& Fields}

Each of the five Realms is listed below, along with its associated
Fields.  Some Fields are followed by a list of suggested Sub-fields.

\subsection{Definitions}
d41 3
a43 4
The Philosopher Profession is designed as a hierarchical structure,
with several separate Realms of knowledge, each of which has its own
Major Fields.  Major Fields, in turn, possess Minor Fields, and these
possess Sub-Fields.
d51 1
a51 1
\subsubsection{Major Fields}
d53 11
a63 22
Realms are divided into large blocks of knowledge, called Major
Fields.  GMs should not need to add new Major Fields to the Realms,
but may do so if they wish.

\subsubsection{Minor Fields}

Small, and quite specific divisions of a Major Field, these are not
limited to only those suggested below.  A.  Philosopher may learn
almost any sub-division of a Major Field as a Minor Field, with the GM
as the final arbiter.  Minor Fields should not be too specific, and
they may contain several possible Sub-Fields.  The most common Minor
Fields concern a particular race or area pertaining to the Major Field.

\subsubsection{Sub-Fields}

These are the smallest and most specific division of knowledge within
the Philosopher Profession.  A Philosopher may learn almost any small
division of a Minor Field as a Sub-Field.  The most common Sub-Fields
are: Type or Race within an Area, history as pertaining to a
particular Race or Area, Colleges within Branches, Individuals within
Factions or Groups (Powers, Demi-Powers, Dragons), and within the
Animal and Plant Worlds, specific subgroups within types.
d65 1
a65 13
\begin{example}
Magical World \imply Undead \imply Greater \imply Vampires, or Magical
World \imply Undead \imply Undead in the Baronies \imply Greater Undead in the
baronies.

Magical World \imply History \& Theory \imply Thaumaturgies \imply
Illusion.  or Magical World \imply History \& Theory \imply Backfires
\imply Backfires in the Thaumaturgical Colleges.

Animal World \imply Avians \imply Nocturnal Birds \imply Owls, or
Animal World \imply Avians \imply The Birds of Alfheim \imply Nocturnal Birds
of Alfheim.
\end{example}
d67 6
a72 35
\subsubsection{Parent Field}

The Field (or Realm) in the hierarchy above the Field concerned is
referred to as the Field's Parent.  The Parent of a Minor Field or
Sub-Field is the next Field up in the hierarchy; the Parent of a Major
Field is its Realm.

\begin{example}
Parent of the Major Field ``Heraldry \& Genealogy'' is the Realm
``The Social World''.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Child Field}

Any Fields in the hierarchy that derive from the Field (or Realm)
concerned are referred to as Child Fields.

\begin{example}
Minor Fields ``Colours'', ``Metals'', and ``Furs'' are Child Fields of
Major Field ``Heraldry \& Genealogy''.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Library}

Any place with 50 or more books may be considered a library, for the
purposes of study.  Libraries are rated for the number of days that a
Philosopher may study in them to answer any particular question.  This
rating is usually equal to Books divided by 50.  Some libraries with
specific collections may be rated higher for some Realms than others.

\begin{example}
The library of the Mittelmark University of Magical Sciences has many
more books dealing with Magic than any other Realm. It is rated at 10
days normally or 15 days if the question is in the Magical World.
\end{example}
d74 1
a74 6
GMs should bear in mind that the books in some libraries will be
predominately in particular languages, and that if the Philosopher is
not literate in that language, or languages, the library may be of
reduced usefulness.

d105 3

At each Rank above 0 (including 4, 7, and 10), the
Philosopher receives a number of Points to spend on Major, Minor and
Sub-Fields.  The number of Points received is: at Ranks 1 to 4, 3; at
Ranks 5 to 7, 5; and at Ranks 8 to 10, 7.  The Points costs are: Major
Field, 3; Minor Field, 2; Sub-Field, 1.  Unspent Points are retained
and may be used together with the Points received for further Ranks.

\subsubsection{Field Restrictions}
d111 5
a115 2
A Philosopher may never learn a field that they do not possess the
Parent of.
d117 1
a117 7
\begin{example}
A Philosopher may not learn the Sub-Field ``Carzalan Heraldry'',
unless they already know Minor Field ``Heraldry of the Baronies'',
which in turn they could not possess without the Major Field
``Heraldry \& Genealogy'', and ultimately the Realm ``The Social
World''.
\end{example}
d119 5
a123 3
These requirements are pre-requisites, not co-requisites.  Therefore a
Sub-field may not be learnt at the same Rank as the Minor Field that
is its Parent.

\subsubsection{Overlaps and Connections}
d149 1
a149 3
In some cases it is possible to reach the same Fields by different

benefit accrues from having the same Field more than once.
d151 7

Baronies \imply Elves in the Baronies.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Sage Status}
d165 1
a165 6
Philosophers of Rank 10 are often referred to as Sages.  Once a
Philosopher has achieved Rank 10, and Sage status, they may not Rank
their Profession further, but may acquire new Realms and Fields.  Each
new Realm costs 6000 ep, and requires 50 days of study, and each Point
used to purchase new fields costs 700 ep, and requires 7 days of
study.
d167 7

To learn a new Major Field costs 3 points, therefore it costs 2100 ep  and
requires 21 days of study.

\subsection{Languages}

Philosophers gain a reduction in the Experience Points costs to learn
languages.  These benefits are in addition to any other reductions
available to the character.

\subsubsection{Speaking}

Philosophers may learn to speak languages at 75\% of the normal
Experience Point cost, provided that the Rank being gained in the
language is not greater than their Rank in Philosopher.

\subsubsection{Literacy}

Philosophers may become literate in any languages that they know, at
50\% of the normal Experience Point cost.

\subsection{Questions}

Philosophers may attempt to answer questions put to them, that they do
not already know the answers to.  These questions may be posed by
themselves, or by other characters.  The chance of successfully
answering a question (within the limitations of the knowledge
available) depends on the difficulty of the question and the relevant
Realms and Fields of the Philosopher.  What is very difficult for
someone with only a passing knowledge of the requisite field may be
very easy for someone who has made an in-depth study of that field.

\subsubsection{Difficulty}

Questions that may be answered by a Philosopher fall into one of five
categories; Very Easy, Easy, Standard, Hard, Very Hard.  The first
step in determining the difficulty of answering the question, is for
the GM to determine what area of knowledge and what exact level of
expertise would the question be Standard for.

A Standard question is one of average difficulty, relative to a given
Field, as determined by the GM.  They usually deal with a reasonably
large sub-set of the knowledge of the Field.

\begin{example}
The question ``Where do Fire Giants mostly live?''  is to the Major
Field ``Ethnology'' of the Social World whereas ``How are furs used in
Carzalan Heraldry?'' is Standard to the Sub-Field ``Carzalan
Heraldry'', of Minor Field ``Heraldry of Baronies'', of the Major
Field ``Heraldry and Genealogy'', of the Social World.
\end{example}

If the Philosopher possesses the Field for which the question is
Standard, but has no more in-depth knowledge applicable to the
question, the difficulty is Standard.  For each Child Field that the
Philosopher has, that the GM determines is relevant, the difficulty
decreases by one step: Standard \imply Easy \imply Very Easy.

\begin{example}
The question ``Where do Fire Giants mostly live?'' is Standard to
the Major Field ``Ethnology'' of the Social World.  As the Philosopher
attempting to answer the question has the Minor Field ``Giants'' of
the Major Field ``Ethnology'', the question becomes easy.  The
Philosopher also has the Sub-Field ``Giants in the Baronies'', but the
GM rules that this very specific information will not help shed light
on where Fire Giants as a group mostly live, and thus it will not help
with the question.
\end{example}

If the Philosopher does not possess the Field for which the question
is Standard, but possesses the Parent of that Field, the difficulty
increases by one step: Standard \imply Hard.  If the Philosopher only
possesses the Parent's Parent, the difficulty increases another step:
Hard \imply Very Hard.  A Philosopher may not answer a question more
than 2 steps removed from the relevant knowledge they possess.

\begin{example}
The question ``How are furs used in Carzalan Heraldry?'' is Standard
to the Sub-Field ``Carzalan Heraldry''.  As the Philosopher attempting
the question does not have that Sub-Field, or even its Parent the
Minor Field ``Heraldry in the Baronies'', but does have the Parent's
Parent Major Field ``Heraldry \& Genealogy'', the difficulty of
answering the question is increased two step to Very Hard.  If the
Philosopher did not know that Major Field, they would be unable to
answer the question at all.
\end{example}

If the Philosopher does not possess the Realm to which the question
belongs, they may not attempt to answer it, unless the question is
Standard at Realm level, in which case the Philosopher may attempt it
as a Hard question.  In some few cases a question may belong to more
than one Realm.

\subsubsection{Answers}

To achieve an answer to a question a Philosopher must undertake a
course of study.  The length of the study period is dependent on
experience, the difficulty of the question, and luck.  A Philosopher
begins their course of study with 0\% (plus a bonus for their
experience and the difficulty of the question) of the course complete.
For each study period (the length of which is determined by
difficulty), D10\% is added to the completeness of the study.  When
completeness reaches 100\%, the Philosopher has found an answer to the
question.  The bonus, and length of study period is determined as
follows:

\bigskip

{\fontsize{7}{8pt}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{lcl}
\textbf{Difficulty} & \textbf{Bonus / Rank} & \textbf{Period} \\
Very Easy		& 8\%		& 5 minutes \\
Easy			& 6\%		& 10 minutes \\
Standard		& 4\%		& 15 minutes \\
Hard			& 2\%		& 2 hours \\
Very Hard		& 1\%		& 5 hours \\
\end{tabular}}
\smallskip

The GM should keep track of how far through their study the
Philosopher is, and it is the GM that makes the D10 rolls, keeping the
results secret from the player.  If the Philosopher wants to know how
far along they are, the GM may inform them in very general terms:
``About half way'', ``mostly complete''.

\begin{example}
A Rank 5 Philosopher is attempting to answer the question ``Where
do Fire Giants mostly live?''. it is of Standard difficulty for them.
When they begin, their course of study is 0\% + (4\% \x 5)
\imply 20\% complete.  Every 15 minutes that they spend studying the
GM rolls D10 and adds that number to the completeness. A while later
the player asks the GM how far through they are.  The GM consults their
running total: 63\%, and answers ``Maybe over half way?''
\end{example}

A Philosopher may, at any time, terminate an incomplete course of
study and attempt to answer the question.  Their accuracy will be
adversely affected however.

It is also possible that some questions (as determined by the GM) are
simply unanswerable.  If this is the case, upon completing their
course of study, the Philosopher will be aware (and convinced) of this
fact.

Even though Philosophers keep notes during their course of study, an
extended interruption may prove a setback.  If a Philosopher ceases a
course of study but resumes it within Rank weeks there are no adverse
effects.  If the interruption is longer than this then half of the
percentage amount that they had achieved, above the base amount for
their Rank and the difficulty of the question, is lost.

\subsubsection{Libraries}

To study to answer questions a Philosopher must have access to one or
more libraries.  A Philosopher may study any particular question at a
library for a number of days equal to the library's rating.  Once a
Philosopher has exhausted the possibilities of a library they must
either find another and continue their study or attempt to answer the
question anyway.  A day of study is 10 hours, and is full-time work.

\subsubsection{Accuracy}

Once the Philosopher has completed their study, (or has not completed
it, but is attempting to answer the question anyway), the GM must
determine the accuracy of the answer.  This accuracy is based on the
difficulty of the question, the experience of the Philosopher, and the
amount of study unfinished, if any.  The accuracy is calculated as
follows:

\smallskip

{\fontsize{7pt}{8}\selectfont
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
 & \textbf{Base} & \textbf{Per} & \\
\textbf{Difficulty} & \textbf{Chance} & \textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Reduct} \\
Very Easy	& 100\%		& +2\%	& -1\% \\
Easy		& 80\%		& +3\%	& -1\% \\
Standard	& 75\%		& +4\%	& -2\% \\
Hard		& 70\%		& +3\%	& -2\% \\
Very Hard	& 60\%		& +3\%	& -3\% \\
a279 4
\smallskip

*The Base Chance is reduced by the Percentage shown for each percent
of study left incomplete.
a280 19
The Base Chance may also be reduced by the GM if they feel that the
Philosopher's sources are particularly inaccurate.  GMs should be
cautious in applying this modifier, and should use it only in unusual
cases.

\subsubsection{Final Result}

If the question is of a Yes/No nature, the accuracy is the chance that
the Philosopher will arrive at the correct answer.  If the question is
more open, the accuracy is the amount of relevant information that the
Philosopher will come up with.

\begin{example}
A Philosopher has an 85\% accuracy with the question ``Can Dryads
use magic?''. This represents their chance of arriving at the answer
``Yes''.  A Philosopher is asked ``How are furs used in Carzalan Heraldry?''
and achieves a result of 115\%, which means they can answer question
and more besides (about 15\% more than the Questioner wanted to know).

\subsubsection{Conversion System}

Because of the new EP costs, the Ranks of current Philosophers may not
be simply changed to the same Rank in the new skill, as low Ranked
characters will not have paid enough EP, and high Ranked ones have
paid too much.  The simplest solution is to convert a Philosopher's
Ranks across but modify the number of ``field points'' gained.  Find
the characters present Rank on the table below.  The ``field points''
column is the number of points that they are given in one lump to
spend on Realms, Major Fields, etc, at the normal rate.  They should
spend these points so as to attempt to cover the same fields as they
already had, wherever possible.  The ``max.  realms'' column is the
maximum number of Realms that they may purchase.  Once converted, a
character may purchase a number of extra point (at 700 EP each) up to
the number shown in the ``extra points'' column with no time
expenditure.  The number that may be purchased should be noted down as
these may be bought st any time in the future and need not be
purchased at the time of conversion.  The only Rank for which this
system does not work is Rank 0.  Philosophers who have this skill at
Rank 0, receive the same Rank in the new skill but must pay 1000 extra
ep. before they can increase their Rank.
