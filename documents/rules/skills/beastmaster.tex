\begin{skill}{Beast Master}{1.0}{beastmaster}

A loyal animal or monster is likely to serve its master far better
than adventuring comrades ever will.  A beast master is one who trains
these creatures to obedience.  They take a wild animal and, from an
adversary relationship, develops a rapport with it.  They train young
animals from birth, until they heed their every command.  A beast
master will, in almost all cases, become very fond of animals.  They
will defend them against wanton cruelty and slaughter, and will treat
their personal charges as family.

A beast master will encounter three kinds of animals: the easily
domesticated (such as the horse), the naturally wild (such as the
pegasus) and an intelligent or rebellious creature (such as the
unicorn).  The latter can never be steadfastly loyal to the beast
master; such creatures always have at least a subconscious desire to
escape.  A beast master can be a slaver if they specialise in training
humanoids.

\subsection{Restrictions}

\subsubsection{A breast master must have atleast 15 Willpower.}

\subsubsection{A beast master may only train animals for their own
personal use until they achieve Rank 5. They may domesticate animals at
any Rank.}

A beast master will normally use their skill to train or domesticate
animals for their own use.  Animals which spend their lives with a
Beast Master and are trained by them will be loyal to their master and
serve and protect them as much as possible.  If necessary, an animal
can be trained to temporarily serve another master (if one week of
mutual training is undergone), but the animal will always obey the
original master before any new one.

If a beast master's Rank is 5 or greater, they may train animals for
other people.  The being who is acquiring the trained creature must
spend (12 - Rank) weeks before it will accept them as its new master,
during which the beast master must be present at least one day per
week.  The creature will heed the beast master's commands before those
of its new owner for as many years as the beast master's Rank at the
time the creature's ownership is transferred.

A beast master of any Rank may domesticate, rather than train,
animals.  Such animals can be commanded by any other person, but
will tend to wander off or revert to their wild state if not
supervised, tied up, or stabled.  Pay especial attention to this rule:
horses and dogs, the most common domestic animals, are governed by it.

\subsection{Benefits}

\subsubsection{A beast master acquires the ability to train one type of
animal and/or monster at Ranks 0, 5 and 10.}

A beast master may acquire the ability to train additional types of
creatures after they have achieved Rank 10 by the expenditure of 2500
Experience Points per type.

A type consists of all creatures listed within one rules sections in
the Monsters section (\eg avians).  A beast master may choose,
instead, all creatures subsumed under a single animal family (\eg
felines).

\subsubsection{A beast master must spend (12 - Rank) months to train an
animal or monster, or a like number of weeks to domesticate one.}

\smallskip

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
\textbf{Creature to be trained is}	& \textbf{Time} \\
Easily domesticated			& \x 0.5 \\
Naturally wild				& \x 1.0 \\
Intelligent or rebellious		& \x 3.0 \\
Raised by beast master from adolescence	& \x 0.5 \\
Domesticated by another	beast master	& \x 1.0 \\
Caught in wilderness			& \x 1.5 \\
\end{tabularx}

The unmodified number of months required is multiplied by all
applicable modifiers. The time to train a monster or animal is
always dependent on the beast master's Rank when they begin the
process.  Any increases in Rank during the training or domestication
period have no effect on the time required.

\subsubsection{A trained animal or monster must make a loyalty check
whenever it recognises that its master is endangering it, or whenever
its master commands an action that runs counter to its instincts.}
\label{beastmaster:loyality}

Whenever a loyalty check is required, the GM rolls percentile dice.
The base chance is 2 \x beast master's WP + (4 \x Rank if the creature
is intelligent or rebellious, 6 \x Rank if the creature is naturally
wild, and 8 \x Rank if the creature is easily domesticated).  If the
owner is not a beast master, use their WP and the Rank of the beast
master when they trained the creature.  If the roll is less than or
equal to this success percentage, the trained creature will do as its
master commands. If the roll is greater than the success percentage,
the creature's reactions will range from balking to fleeing to turning
on its master, as the roll increases (GM's discretion).

\subsubsection{A domesticated creature must make a loyalty check if
the circumstances described above arise.}

The GM rolls D100.  If the resulting number is less than or equal to
current master's WP + beast master's Rank, the domesticated creature
will perform the action.  If the roll is greater than the success
percentage, but less than or equal to twice that percentage, the
creature will balk.  If the roll is greater than two times the success
percentage, but less than three times that percentage, the creature
will take flight.  If the roll is greater than three times the success
percentage, the creature will turn on its master.

A roll of 100 always indicates that a domesticated creature turns on
its master.  A roll of 96 through 99 indicates that the creature takes
flight if the success percentage is 47 or greater.

\subsubsection{A beast master who intimidates their animals adds one to
their Rank when calculating training or domestication time, but the GM
adds 10 to any loyalty check dice-roll for one of their animals.}

\subsubsection{A beast master may train or domesticate as many creatures
as their Rank at one time.}

All creatures being trained or domesticated concurrently must be of
the same type.

\subsection{Cost}

\subsubsection{A beast master must pay 100 Silver Pennies per creature
trained and 25 Silver Pennies per creature domesticated.}

They may halve the cost for upkeep of creatures if they build a
stable.  A horse-sized stable costs (500 + 150 \x Stalls) Silver
Pennies to construct, and costs (Stalls) Silver Pennies for repairs
after the first year.
