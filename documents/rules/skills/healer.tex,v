@\begin{skill*}{Healer}{1.12}{healer}
The healer skill is pseudo-magical and Healers are able to cure all
physical ills and perform miracles.  It is a highly skilled profession
and Healers are not common but even so their existence means the
health and life span of people in the DQ world are considerably better
than their medieval counterpart.

A healer's empathy often gives them a distaste for causing pain to
others.

A healer will charge whatever their client can afford for their lower
Ranked abilities. The charge for a miracle (the performance of an
ability Rank 8 or greater) will normally exceed 2000 Silver Pennies.

A healer may also use their abilities upon animals which they have
Beastmaster (\S\ref{beastmaster}) familiarity. However non sentients
cannot be resurrected.

The section \S\ref{adventure:health} Health and Fitness details the
effects of injury and illness on patients.

\subsubsection{Field Operations}

Once a healer begins work on curing a patient the condition of the
patient is ``stabilised'' while that curing is continuing. This means
that no Endurance or Fatigue loss will occur for the condition that is
being cured. Other afflictions will be unaffected. After each healing
attempt a pulse effectively passes prior to any other attempt
beginning.

\subsection{Benefits}

A healer gains specific abilities at each Rank as per the following
table:
\begin{Enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\item
Empathy, Non-tactile empathy (optional)

\item
Cure Infection, Disease, Headaches, Fever

\item
Soothe Pain, Prolong Life

\item
Heal Endurance, Transfer Fatigue

\item
Neutralise Poison, Graft Skin

\item
Repair Muscle, Preserve Dead

\item
Repair Bones

\item
Repair Tissues and Organs

\item
Resurrect the Dead

\item
Regenerate Limbs and Joints

\item
Regenerate Trunk, Head and Vital Organs
\end{Enumerate}

NB. A healer must choose at Rank 0 whether or not to learn Non-tactile
empathy.

\subsection{Restrictions}

A healer must expend as many Fatigue Points as the Rank at which they
acquired the ability they are using (except non-tactile empathy).

A healer may use any of their abilities (with the exception of
resurrection) upon themselves.

A healer must ``lay hands'' (place their hands) on an entity on whom
they are to use any of their abilities (except non-tactile empathy).

A healer has the following modifications to their combat strike chances:

\emph{Tactical Empathy:}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX}
- 1 / 2 Rank & Close Combat strike chance \\
- 1 / 5 Rank & Melee Combat strike chance \\
\end{tabularx}

\emph{Non-Tactile Empathy:}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{lX}
- 1 / Rank  & Close Combat strike chance \\
-1 / 2 Rank & Melee Combat strike chance \\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Ability Descriptions}

\subsubsection{Empathy}
\basechance{automatic}
\timetaken{5 seconds}
When a healer lays on hands they immediately invoke empathy.

A healer uses empathy to identify which of the healing abilities is
required to heal the patient.

The healer automatically detects the surface emotions of the entity
being healed. An entity's surface emotions are those which currently
occupy their conscious mind. The GM informs the healer of the general
feelings of the being with which they have empathy.

\subsubsection{Non-Tactile Empathy}

\basechance{Perception + 10 / Rank}
\timetaken{5 seconds}
If the healer has learnt non-tactile empathy they may attempt to
detect the surface emotions of an entity no more than (2 \x Rank) feet
away from them at a cost of 1 Fatigue Point. If the entity actively
resists then subtract twice the target's Willpower from this success
chance.

\subsubsection{Cure Infection, Disease, Headaches, Fever and Graft Skin}
\label{healer:cure}
\basechance{15 \x Rank + Patient's Endurance}
\timetaken{30 minutes - 2 / Rank}
A healer cures fevers and diseases, neutralises poisons and grafts
skin in much the same manner that medicines and antidotes do.

If the healing attempt is unsuccessful the patient subtracts 10 from
their next die roll to see if they naturally recovers from their
affliction.

\subsubsection{Neutralise Poison}

\basechance{90 + Rank or 50 - 5 \x Difference in Rank (see below)}
\timetaken{5 seconds}
A healer may neutralise the effects of a natural venom or the effects
of a synthetic poison created by an alchemist of equal or lesser
Rank. If a synthetic poison is produced by an alchemist of greater
Rank they must roll the 2nd Base Chance above.

\subsubsection{Soothe Pain}

\basechance{90\% + Rank}
\timetaken{60 seconds - 5 / Rank}
\duration{Rank squared hours}
When a healer uses their soothe pain ability, they numb their
patient's nervous system so that it will not transmit pain sensations
to their brain. The ability also has a soporific effect upon the
patient, so that they will not inadvertently injure themselves while
unable to distinguish hurtful actions. The GM may, at their
discretion, permit the healer to use this ability as if they had fed
or injected their patient with a local or general anaesthetic,
tranquilliser, etc.

\subsubsection{Prolong Life}
\basechance{90\% + Rank}
\timetaken{60 seconds - 5 / Rank}
When a healer uses the prolong life ability add D10 \x (Healer's Rank +
Patient's Endurance) days to the life of their patient. A patient's
life may not be prolonged to over three times their natural life. An
entity with a prolonged life has a reduced chance of resurrection.

\subsubsection{Heal Endurance and Transfer Fatigue}

\basechance{90\% + Rank}
\timetaken{Time: 11 minutes - 1 / Rank}
Heal Endurance will cure the patient of [D + Rank - 5] Endurance
points.  It will not heal damage associated with a specific grievous
injury.

When a healer transfers fatigue the patient gains one Fatigue point
for each point the healer expends (above the fatigue cost to use the
ability).

An entity may never have more Fatigue or Endurance Points than the
value of the relevant characteristic and excess points cured have no
effect upon the patient.

\subsubsection{Repair Damage}

\basechance{90\% + Rank}
\timetaken{50 hours - 3 / Rank}
A healer may repair torn, damaged, or broken muscles, bone, tissues
and organs.  Generally these abilities will be used to repair the
effects of grievous injuries.

At least one half of a muscle, bone, or organ to be repaired must
remain in the patient's body if the healer is to use one of these
abilities. Tissue may be grown from existing material in or on the
patient's body.

A healer can act as a cosmetic surgeon. First, they sedate their
patient with the soothe pain ability. They then slice and reshape the
skin, muscles, and bones which are deemed unsightly, and make them
whole with the appropriate repair ability. Unless the healer has also
learnt regeneration, it is best that they work with a partner.

\subsubsection{Preserve Dead}

\basechance{90\% + Rank}
\timetaken{60 minutes - 5 / Rank}
A healer can suspend the time limit on resurrection by preserving the
dead body of a being. Each time a healer uses the preserve dead
ability, the body will not ``age'' for a number of days equal to the
healer's Rank. This ability may be repeated by the same healer on the
same body.

\subsubsection{Resurrection}

\timetaken{60 minutes - 5 / Rank}
\emph{Base Chance:} Patient's Endurance + 8\% / Rank \\
\hspace*{2em} minimum = Rank \\
\hspace*{2em} maximum = 90 + Rank \\
\hspace*{2em} regardless of the total modifiers.

\emph{Base Chance Modifiers:}\\
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{rX}
+5	& healer is life aspected \\
+5	& patient is life-aspected \\
-5	& healer is death-aspected \\
-5	& patient is death-aspected \\
-1	& per year (or fraction) the patient's life has been prolonged \\
-1	& per day of regeneration it would normally require to make the body whole \\
-10	& body is whole but has suffered Damage Points equal to or greater
 than twice its Endurance (including after death damage) \\
-10	& per unsuccessful resurrection attempt since patient died \\
\end{tabularx}

\begin{effects}
A resurrection will cure the body of all ills and damage done to it
provided that Rank 8 healing or below would been sufficient had the
patient been alive. For example, poison and non-specific wounds will
be cured automatically.

If the resurrection is successful, the patient is resurrected with
their body whole. Their Endurance Characteristic is decreased by one,
though all of their other characteristics remain as before they died.

After a resurrection the patient will have 1 Endurance point and 0
Fatigue. The Endurance is considered to be grievous damage and the
Fatigue loss is deemed to be due to tiredness. This means that the
Fatigue loss may only be recovered by sleep, rest, hot meals or some
form of fatigue transfer and the endurance loss may be cured by a
Healer, magic or by letting the body heal itself naturally.

If the resurrection is unsuccessful the patient is not resurrected and
their Endurance characteristic is decreased by one. The body is
preserved for one full day after the attempt. When an entity's
Endurance is reduced to zero or less, that entity may no longer be
resurrected.

If the roll for resurrection is equal to or greater than (90 + Rank),
the healer has summoned a malignant spirit, rather than the patient's
life-force.  The spirit will drain the healer's Endurance
characteristic by [D - 5]. The spirit will then return to the
netherworld.
\end{effects}

\smallskip
\emph{Restrictions:}
\begin{Enumerate}
\item
A healer may attempt the resurrection of an entity who is less than 10
\x Rank hours dead.

\item
A healer must have a body part at least the size of a torso to attempt
the resurrection of an entity. A healer will not succeed if they
attempt the resurrection of a living being from a severed body part
(there is only one life force). If a body is completely destroyed
(perhaps burned), which prevents the resurrection of the entity, that
thing may become a revenant.

\item
If the patient has wounds that require regeneration (Rank 9 or 10)
healing, these need to be healed separately.

\item
Most vital organs will need to be healed prior to the resurrection
otherwise the body will died again immediately (the notable exception
being the eyes).

\item
The healer need not know what the patient looked like since the
healing of the body is governed by its own characteristics. Hence any
changes that had been made to the body (for example facial changes or
embedded items) will be gone after the resurrection.

\item
A player may take no action with their character's dead body.

\item
In rare instances a healer may be able to resurrect a life force into
a different body. The resurrected entity has the physical
characteristics of the new body and the mental characteristics from
the life force.  It will take some months for the entity to get used
to the new body and this will effect base chances of physical
abilities.  The GM will advise the specifics..

\item
A body that has been animated (\eg Zombie) may still be resurrected
provided it is no longer animated and all the other conditions have
been made (for example length of death, condition, etc.). Note that
the Healer Preserve Dead will not affect Zombies.
\end{Enumerate}

\subsubsection{Regeneration}

\basechance{90\% + Rank}
\timetaken{1 week (per organ or body part)}
A healer can regenerate every portion of an entity's body including
vital organs or severed body parts.

A healer must regenerate each vital organ or body part separately. An
entity's vital organs are the heart, stomach, viscera (liver, small
and large intestines and kidneys), genetalia, brain, and eyes.

A regenerated vital organ will immediately begin to function if enough
of the rest of the entity's body is in working order. Otherwise, the
vital organ will be dormant until the healer can repair or regenerate
the necessary body parts. The regeneration time does not need to be
consecutive, but the damaged part will not function until the
regeneration is complete.

\subsection{Potion Costs}
\label{healer:potions}
A healer can manufacture certain potions in conjunction with an
alchemist. See Alchemist (\ref{alchemist}) for more details.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xr}
			& \textbf{Base} \\
\textbf{Potion}		& \textbf{Value} \\
Cure Disease		& 600 \\

The life span of one who lives in a fantasy world is considerably
longer than that of their medieval counterpart.  The disparity in age
can be attributed to the presence of healers where mana exists.  These
partially empathic beings can cure all the physical ills which beset a
character during adventure.  Healers do not generally make good
fighters, since active engagement in combat is usually contrary to the
principles of their profession.

d101 44
a144 47
A being's surface emotions are those which currently occupy their
conscious mind.  The GM informs the healer of the general feelings of
the being with which they have empathy.

A healer may also choose the ability of non-tactile empathy (though
this has its disadvantages; see below).  A healer with such empathy
may attempt to detect the surface emotions of a being no more than (2
\x Rank) feet away from them at a cost of 1 Fatigue Point.  The
healer's success percentage is equal to (Perception + 10
\x Rank) if the other being consents to empathic communication.
Subtract twice the being's Willpower if the target Actively Resists
(see \S\ref{magic:resistance}) the detection of their surface
emotions.

If a healer chooses the non-tactile empathy ability, subtract their
Rank from their Base Chance to strike in Close Combat, and subtract
one-half their Rank in Melee Combat.  If a healer only has empathy
when laying on hands, subtract one-half their Rank from their Base
Chance in Close Combat, and one-fifth in Melee Combat.  Round
fractions down in all cases.

\subsubsection{A healer cures fevers and diseases, neutralises poisons
and grafts skin in much the same manner that medicines and antidotes
do.}
\label{healer:cure.disease}

\index{poisons!healer}

When a healer attempts to cure a being of an affliction (\ie fever,
disease, or skin problem), their success percentage is (15 \x Healer's
Rank + Patient's Endurance).  The GM rolls percentile dice: if the
roll is less than or equal to the success percentage, the patient is
cured.  If the roll is greater than the success percentage, the
patient subtracts 10 from their next dice-roll to see if they
naturally recover from their affliction (see \S\ref{infection} and
\S\ref{recuperation}).  See Alchemist (\S\ref{alchemist:potions}) for
details on salves and antidotes.

A healer must spend (30 - 2 \x Rank) minutes to implement any
of the abilities covered in this rule.

A healer automatically neutralise the effects of a natural venom.  A
healer may automatically neutralise the effects of a synthetic poison
created by an alchemist of equal or lesser Rank.  Their success
percentage to neutralise a synthetic poison produced by an alchemist
of greater Rank than they are equal to (50 - 5 \x Difference in
Rank)\%

When a healer uses the prolong life ability add D10 \x (Healer's Rank

(including cosmetic surgery) provided that a healing skill of Rank 8
or below would been sufficient had the patient been alive.  For
example, poison and standard wounds will be cured automatically.  If
the patient has wounds that require Rank 9 or above healing, these
will have to be cured separately.  Most vital organs will need to be
cured prior to the resurrection (the notable exception being the
eyes).  The healer need not know what the patient looked like since
the healing of the body is governed by its own genetics (or aura, if
you prefer).  Hence any changes that had been made to the body (for
example facial changes or embedded items) will have to be redone after
the resurrection.

The body need not be in a ``normal'' state of health before the
attempt is made.  There is a minus of 1\% for every day of
regeneration it would normally require to make the body whole.  The
actual resurrection time required is as [60 - 5 \x Rank] minutes.

If a body is Zombie'ed, then it may still be resurrected when it is no
longer a Zombie provided all the other conditions have been made (for
example length of death, condition, etc.)  Note that the Healer
Preserve Dead will not affect Zombies.
d264 3
a266 15
A healer may attempt the resurrection of a being who is no more than
(10 \x Healer's Rank) hours dead.  

A healer must have a body part at least the size of a torso to attempt
the resurrection of a being. A healer will not succeed if they attempt
the resurrection of a living being from a severed body part (there is
only one life-force).  If a body is completely destroyed (perhaps
burned), which prevents the resurrection of the being, that thing may
become a revenant.

When a healer attempts to use the resurrect the dead ability, the base
success percentage is equal to (8 \x Healer's Rank + Patient's
Endurance).  The base percentage is modified as follows:

\begin{Itemize}
d268 2
a269 1
Add 5\% if the healer is life-aspected.
d272 6
a277 1
Add 5\% if the patient is life-aspected.
d280 2
a281 1
Subtract 5\% if the healer is death-aspected.
d284 3
a286 1
Subtract 5\% if the patient is death-aspected.
d289 4
a292 2
Subtract 1\% for each year (or fraction thereof) the patient's life
has been prolonged.
d295 1
a295 2
Subtract 1\% for each day of regeneration it would normally require to
make the patient's body whole.
d298 6
a303 4
Subtract 10\% if the patient's body is whole but suffered Damage
Points equal to or greater than twice its Endurance when it died (the
patient's slayer may carve up the body to bring this provision into
effect).
d306 5
a310 32
Subtract 10\% for each unsuccessful resurrection attempt since patient
died.
\end{Itemize}

The minimum success percentage for resurrection is equal to the Rank
of the healer, regardless of the total modifiers.

If the resurrection roll is successful, the patient is resurrected
with their body whole.  Their Endurance is decreased by one, though
all of their other characteristics remain as before they died.  If the
roll is greater than the success percentage, the patient is not
resurrected and their Endurance is decreased by one.  The body is
preserved for one full day after an unsuccessful resurrection attempt.
When a being's Endurance is reduced to zero or less, that being may no
longer be resurrected.

If the roll for resurrection is equal to or greater than (90 +
Healer's Rank), the healer has summoned a malignant phantasm, rather
than the patient's life-force.  The phantasm will drain some power
from the healer, reducing their Endurance value by [D - 5] (minimum of
1).  The phantasm will then return to the netherworld.

A dead character may take no action with their body.  An Adept may
compel the body to speak by spell, and the life-force may be placed in
another body, which the player would then control.

If a character's life-force is placed in another's body, they retain
any magical abilities, the skill Ranks are halved (rounding down) and
the combat abilities are those of the previous inhabitant of the body.
The temporary union of life-force and body uses the value of the
body's first four characteristics, and the value of the life-force's
characteristics for the remainder.
a312 25
\label{healer:regenerate}

A healer can regenerate every portion of a being's body.  A being's
vital organs are the heart, liver, stomach, small and large
intestines, kidneys, genitals, brain, and eyes.  A healer must spend
(15 - Rank) days regenerating each vital organ (\ie creating a new
one).  A regenerated vital organ will immediately begin to function if
enough of the rest of the being's body is in working order.
Otherwise, the vital organ will be dormant until the healer can repair
or regenerate the necessary body parts.

If a portion of the body has been severed, or there is a hole in a
being's anatomy, the GM measures the body part of the player which
corresponds to that which is missing from the character's body.  The
healer will require a number of days to regenerate the character's
missing body part equal to the measurement in inches of the player's
corresponding part.  The character's race does not affect the time
requirement; the circulatory system regenerates at a constant rate for
every race.

\begin{example}
A character's arm has been severed at the shoulder.  The player's arm
measures 24 inches.  The healer can regenerate the character's arm in
24 (not necessarily consecutive) days.

The GM informs the healer that his comrade feels great pain.  If the
healer lays hands on an assassin who is feigning injury to lull any
suspicion the healer may have, the GM will inform the healer of the
assassin's murderous intent just before they announce the result of the
assassin's attack.

When a healer uses the transfer fatigue (points) ability, their
patient gains one Fatigue Point for each Fatigue Point the healer
expends (above the fatigue cost to use the ability).  A being may
never have more Fatigue or Endurance Points than the value of the
relevant characteristic.  Excess points cured by the healer have no
effect upon the patient.

A healer may not use the cure Endurance Points or transfer Fatigue
Points abilities while on the Tactical Display (\ie not while in
combat).  It requires (11 - Rank) minutes each time the healer
implements either of these abilities.

patient is not resurrected and their Endurance is decreased by one.
The body is preserved for one full day after an unsuccessful
resurrection attempt.

\subsection{Addendum}

What follows is a summary of how various healing abilities are
currently played.

\subsubsection{Grievous Damage}

Grievous damage is damage that is inflicted is specified on the
grievous injury table.  It can only be healed once the wound
associated with it has been healed (For example if one had an ear
sliced off for 2 extra Endurance damage then those 2 Endurance could
not be healed until the ear had been regenerated).  Even if the wound
is such that extra repair or regeneration is not necessary (for
example concussion), a healer is required to heal the Endurance points
(that is a healing potion or spell is not sufficient).  Alternatively,
the body will heal naturally as specified in the DQ Manual
(\S\ref{recuperation}).

\subsubsection{Resurrections}

A resurrection will cure the body of all ills and damage done to it
(including so-called plastic surgery) provided that a healing skill of
Rank 8 or below would been sufficient had the patient been alive.  For
example, poison and standard wounds will be cured automatically.  If
the patient has wounds that require Rank 9 or above healing, these
will have to be cured separately.  Most vital organs will need to be
cured prior to the resurrection (the notable exception being the
eyes).  The healer need not know what the patient looked like since
the healing of the body is governed by its own genetics (or aura, if
you prefer).  Hence any changes that had been made to the body (for
example facial changes or embedded items) will have to be redone after
the resurrection.


The body need not be in a ``normal'' state of health before the
attempt is made.  There is a minus of 1\% for every day of
regeneration it would normally require to make the body whole.  The
actual resurrection time required is as per preserve (that is [60 - 5
\x Rank] minutes).

If a body is Zombie'ed, then it may still be resurrected when it is no
longer a Zombie provided all the other conditions have been made (for
example length of death, condition, etc.)  Note that the Healer
Preserve Dead will not affect Zombies.

The Healer Preserve Dead ability may be repeated by the same healer
on the same body.

After a resurrection the patient will have 1 Endurance point and 0
Fatigue.  The Endurance is considered to be grievous damage and the
Fatigue loss is deemed to be due to tiredness.  This means that the
Fatigue loss may only be recovered by sleep, rest, hot meals or some
form of fatigue transfer and the endurance loss may only be recovered
by the arts of a Healer (Cure Endurance), magic (Celestial, Rune,
Earth or Mind Mage Healing, and Mind Mage Empathy) or by letting the
body heal itself as specified in the DQ Manual (\S\ref{recuperation}).

Although the Guild does not charge for healing services of Rank 4 or
less (another free Guild service to its members) it obviously has a
limit on the amount of healing that can be supplied.  For this reason,
resurrection patients are usually only treated with a single heal per
day (5 Endurance points).  Such healing is administered within an hour
of the resurrection which is normally performed as soon as possible
and thereafter at twenty four hour intervals.  Thus it will usually be
several days before the patient is fully cured.


\subsubsection{Field Operations}

Once a healer begins work on curing a patient the condition of the
patient is ``stabilised'' while that curing is continuing.  This means
that no Endurance or Fatigue loss will occur for the condition that is
being cured.  Other afflictions will be unaffected.  After each
healing attempt a pulse effectively passed prior to any other attempt
being begun.

\subsubsection{Below Zero Endurance}

When a character is below zero Endurance they are on the very brink of
death.  They will continue to take damage from any further blows,
spells, grievous wounds which are bleeders, burning, etc. and in any
case will lose 1 Fatigue (Endurance when Fatigue is exhausted) per
pulse due to blood loss and system failure.  They will not die
however until their Endurance falls below negative one-half their
\emph{original} Endurance.  If they can be healed to at least 0
Endurance before this occurs then they will not die.  The Endurance
can be cured via magic (for example Celestial or Mind Mage healing,
Mind Mage Empathy) or the arts of a healer (Rank 3 -- Cure Endurance).

The entity cannot drink a healing potion but one can be massaged down
their throat.  The chance of doing this is equal to the Manual
Dexterity + Perception of the person administering the potion, or if a
healer, 90 + Healer Rank.  If successful then D10 per 10 points of the
healing potion's curing (round down) will be received.  If the person
fails the roll, the potion is wasted, but no harmful effects occur to
the patient.

GMs should not let players take advantage of out of character
information when another player's character is below 0 Endurance.  A
visual and tactile examination of the entity will reveal that the
entity is dead.  A successful DA or empathy will reveal the actual
state of the entity.  (Remember that all skills have a maximum of (90
+ Rank)\% chance of being successful, even if they have no stated base
chance).

d122 18
a139 18
When a healer uses his soothe pain ability, he numbs his patient's
nervous system so that it will not transmit pain sensations to his
brain. The ability also has a soporific effect upon the patient, so
that he will not inadvertently injure himself while unable to
distinguish hurtful actions.  The GM may, at his discretion, permit
the healer to use this ability as if he had fed or injected his
patient with a local or general anaesthetic, tranquiliser, etc. The
effects of the soothe pain ability last for the healer's (Rank
squared) hours.

When a healer uses the prolong life ability  add D10
\x (Healer's Rank + Patient's Endurance) days to the life of
his patient.  A patient's life may not be prolonged to over three
times his natural life.  A being with a prolonged life has a reduced
chance of resurrection (see 55.7).

A healer must spend (60 - 5 \x Rank) seconds to implement the first
ability, and a like number of minutes to implement the second.
d148 6
a153 6
When a healer uses the transfer fatigue (points) ability, his patient

the patient.

A healer can act as a cosmetic surgeon.  First, he sedates his patient
with the soothe pain ability.  He then slices and reshapes tile skin,
muscles, and bones which are deemed unsightly, and makes them whole
with the appropriate repair ability.  Unless the healer has gained the
regeneration abilities (see \ref{healer:regenerate} ), it is best that
he work with a healer partner.

body is preserved for one full day after an unsuccessful resurrection
attempt.

If the roll for resurrection is equal to or greater than (90 + Healer's
Rank), the healer has summoned a malignant phantasm, rather than his
patient's life-force.  The phantasm will drain some power from the
healer, reducing his Endurance value by [D - 5] (minimum of 1).  The
