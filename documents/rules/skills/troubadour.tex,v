@\begin{skill}{Troubadour}{2.0}{troubadour}

A troubadour is a multi-talented entertainer and performer, and a well
skilled troubadour may be an actor, poet, mimic and musician. The most
powerful ability that a troubadour can gain is the Bardic Voice, which
enables them to influence all but the deaf.

\subsection{Benefits}

All troubadours gain a grounding in stagecraft. They become able to
size up an audience and determine what form of entertainment will be
the best to perform, and how to handle interjection and ridicule.

In addition, a troubadour gains 3 abilities at Rank 0, and one further
ability per Rank. All abilities are usually performed at the overall
Rank ofthe troubadour. However, a troubadour may choose to specialise.
If, upon gaining a new Rank, the troubadour wishes to forego gaining a
new ability, they may specialise in one of the abilities that they
already possess. That ability then operates at (troubadour's Rank +
1), maximum 10. A troubadour may specialise more than once with the
same ability, gaining Rank + 2, Rank + 3, etc. Additional abilities
may be gained after achieving Rank 10, by the expenditure of 500
Experience Points and 2 weeks of training. Individual Base Chances are
not provided for the various troubadour skills; rather there is a
generic Base Chance of 3 \x appropriate characteristic (+ 5 / Rank),
modified by the GM to reflect the difficulty of the feat being
attempted.

The abilities available to a troubadour are:

\begin{Description}

\item[Acrobatics]
mostly involves tumbling across the ground, but also performing
manoeuvres after swinging from a trapeze, rope, or bar; jumping from a
springboard, or high ledge.

\item[Acting]
Portraying fictitious personalities and devising rationales for
assumed identities.  Usually involves accentuated and exaggerated
actions and emotions.

\item[Bardic voice]
(see below). Note: A troubadour may not specialise in Bardic Voice.

\item[Comedy]
The use of timing, inflection and language to cause merriment or
laughter. Also writing both jokes and skits. Comedy may also be
combined or included in many other art forms.

\item[Dance]
Mostly traditional, often rural dances, performed for an
audience; also includes creating new dances.

\item[Fire eating]
Appearing to swallow and/or produce flame, usually, from the mouth.
To do this, a fire eater requires a special liquid, which may be
purchased from an Alchemist for a modest fee.

\item[Juggling]
Throwing and catching objects. A juggler is able to keep up to 1 (+ 1
/ Rank) items, of equal weight and size, in the air at the same time.
If the items juggled are of a different size and/or weight, each
difference counts as another item juggled.

\item[Make up]
using props, stage makeup, and items such as wigs, fake beards, and
wax noses, a troubadour can portray a character of a different age,
race, sex, or profession to their own.

\item[Mime]
Using only the performer's body, and its movements, to convey an idea,
describe a scene, tell a tale, or entertain.

\item[Mimicry]
Imitating sounds and voices accurately and believably.

\item[Patter]
Talking interestingly, seemingly non-stop, either as advertising for a
show or as a misdirecting part of a performance.

\item[Play an instrument]
This ability may be taken several times with different instruments. A
singer is one who has play instrument (voice). A troubadour can
usually play similar instruments to the ones they have chosen at
(Rank / 2).

\item[Poetry]
Creating and reciting poetry, including lengthy epics running to
hundreds of lines.

\item[Prestidigitation]
Manipulation of small articles such as coins, eggs, or pebbles to make
them move, disappear and reappear in unusual and entertaining
ways. This ability also gives a bonus to the casting of all Minor
Magics of 2\% (+ 2 / Rank).

\item[Production]
Play writing and turning a play into a successful production. Includes
set design and sound effects.  The higher the Rank, the less likely it
is that a major catastrophe will befall the production through
something having been forgotten or overlooked.

\item[Puppetry]
Writing a story to be performed by puppeteers, and performing a story
or play with puppets.

\item[Stilt walking]
Balancing and walking on stilts of up to 50\% (+ 20\% / Rank) of the
troubadour's height.

\item[Storytelling]
Creating and reciting stories for an audience.

\item[Sword swallowing]
Controlling the mouth, tongue and throat such as to be able to allow
long, rigid props to pass into the throat.

\item[Tightrope walking]
Walking, balancing, and turning on a taut raised rope, or narrow beam.

\item[Ventriloquism]
The ability to speak without moving the lips and make the voice seem
to come from any location up to (Rank / 2) feet away.

\end{Description}

\subsection{Bardic Voice}

A troubadour may use their Bardic Voice in an attempt to influence an
audience. Beings who are affected will seethe troubadour as their
friend, andthe troubadour's words as wise and well meant. Bardic
Voice may be used, for example, to calm a lynch mob, or to begin a
riot against a cruel tyrant. The troubadour begins speaking to key
elements in the crowd, stirring their emotions and playing upon their
beliefs and feelings. All beings to be affected must be within
earshot, and capable of understanding the language used by the
troubadour. Whenthe troubadour begins to use this ability they may
enthral up to (4 + 6 / Rank) beings, with (15 - Rank) minutes being
required to work their skill. Once they have spent the required time,
the troubadour makes a Check to see if they are having the desired
effect. If successful,the troubadour may elect to use their voice
again on the same crowd. By doing this they may double the number of
beings whose attention they have captured. Using Bardic Voice is
tiring, and a troubadour must expend 4 FT each time that they use this
ability. A troubadour may use their voice continuously upon a crowd
until they exhaust their FT; they reach the limit of the size of
audience; they fail a Bardic Voice roll; or they have doubled (Rank /
2, round down) times. The Base Chance is 50\% (+ 5 / Rank), modified
by the GM for the reasonableness ofthe troubadour's suggestions and
the audiences' predisposition to certain actions.

\section{Troubadour}
\label{troubadour}
d3 4
a6 15
In a DragonQuest world, a minstrel who wishes to be welcome for their
entertainment abilities during their travels is known as a troubadour.

A troubadour becomes a multi-talented performer as they increase their
experience in the field. The troubadour is also a student of the
people they visit, and is as knowledgeable as a scholar in the matter
of customs.  A troubadour, being a skilled actor, can also be a master
of disguise.  The most useful ability a troubadour will gain is their
bardic voice, which enables them to influence the actions of all but
the deaf.

The abilities subsumed in the troubadour rules are usable by such a
character in situations not explicitly covered in the next few pages.
The GM should improvise and allow a troubadour character to use their
skill in appropriate instances.
d10 143
a152 93
\subsubsection{A troubadour acquires one ability per Rank.}

The character begins with one of the following abilities at Rank 0.
All acquired abilities can be performed skillfully.

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Play the instrument of the player's choice. The troubadour must
acquire this ability anew for each separate instrument they wish to
use.
\item	Sing or chant.
\item	Recite stories and legends.
\item	Compose stories and legends.
\item	Perform mime.
\item	Mimic speech.
\item	Act out skits or parody.
\item	Tell and compose jokes.
\item	Dance (especially folk dance).
\item	Dress appropriately to all situations.
\item	Simulate wide range of emotions.
\item	Execute acrobatics.
\item	Amuse small children.
\item	Amuse  semi-intelligent   creatures.
\item	Appear attractive.
\end{enumerate}

A troubadour may gain additional abilities after achieving Rank 10
by the expenditure of 500 Experience Points per ability.

\subsubsection{A troubadour's chance of successfully performing minor
magic is increased by 2\% per Rank.}

\subsubsection{When a troubadour uses their Perception value to gain
information about the customs or habits of humanoids, add 2 per Rank
they have achieved to their success percentage.}

\subsubsection{A troubadour can use disguise to appear of a different
humanoid race, gender, or profession.}

A troubadour cannot disguise themself as a member of a race for which
their size is inappropriate (e.g., an elf troubadour cannot disguise
themself as a halfling) or as practitioner of a profession for which
they are physically unsuited (e.g., a frost giant troubadour could not
imitate a jockey).  A troubadour's disguise ability is intended to
fool someone who does not know the humanoid the troubadour is
masquerading; if the troubadour is attempting to pass themself off as
an acquaintance of a particular being, the GM will have to determine
the chance of the substitution being noticed.

A troubadour's base success percentage to use their disguise ability is
(12 \x Rank)\%.  Subtract:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Two times the Perception of the being to be deceived by the troubadour
if the troubadour is impersonating a member of their own race.

\item
Four times the Perception of the being to be deceived by the
troubadour if the troubadour is impersonating a member of another
race.

\item
(11 - Troubadour's Rank) if they impersonate a person of opposite
gender.
\end{enumerate}

If the GM's roll on percentile dice is equal to or less than the
troubadour's success percentage, the being to whom the troubadour is
falsely representing themself is taken in.  If the roll is greater
than the success percentage, the being notices inconsistencies (with
the role being assumed) in the troubadour's appearance or behaviour.
The inconsistency becomes more glaring as the roll approaches 100.  If
a troubadour is using disguise in close proximity to a being, a check
against their success percentage must be made every hour.

\subsubsection{A troubadour can use their bardic voice to charm several
beings at once.}

A troubadour may use their bardic voice on not more than (2 + 2 \x
Rank) beings who can understand the language which they speak.  The
troubadour may not use the voice ability in combat, but may use it
against hostile beings.  A Willpower check must be made for every
being the troubadour hopes to affect.  The success percentage for the
Willpower check is (10 \x Troubadour's Rank - 2 \x Being's
Willpower)\%.  If the roll is less than or equal to the success
percentage, the being is charmed, as described in the College of
Ensorcelments and Enchantments spell of the same name (see
\S\ref{e-and-e}).  If the roll is greater than the success percentage,
the being is not affected.

A troubadour must expend (15 - Rank) Fatigue Points every time they
use the bardic voice ability.
