\begin{Description}

\item[Kick] The character may kick rather than striking with their
hands in Unarmed Combat, enabling them to attack with their hands
full. They may attempt to Trip with their feet; the normal Unarmed
Base Chance and damage apply. They may also use a kick as their
secondary weapon for a Multiple Strike Attack.

\item[Multi-hex Strike] The character may choose any two-handed
B-class weapon with this ability.  They may strike up to three figures
in adjacent hexes in their Melee Zone. Their Strike Chance is reduced
by -20 on each attack.  This is a full Melee Attack action.

\item[Multiple Strike] A figure who is armed with two prepared weapons
(one in each hand) may attempt a Multiple Strike. The two weapons need
not be targeted against the same opponent, but must be of the same
type (Ranged or Melee). The Strike Chance of the Primary weapon is
reduced by -10, while the Strike Chance of the Secondary weapon is
reduced by -30. Ambidextrous figures suffer a -10 penalty with each
attack. This is a full Melee Attack action.

\item[Ambidextrous (weapon)] The character gains the ability to use
this weapon in their off hand as if it was their primary hand.  This
feat must be taken on a per weapon basis.
