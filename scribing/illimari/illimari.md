Here that a party of useless incompetents as been captured and must be
rescued.  The party was made of a list of social failures, including
Flamis, Basilisk, PJ, Icorone, Anathea and Stark.

The old party employer, who an I can't remember off hand, arranged
to get us there and back by way of the Kalama and a void cruiser.

Travel through the void to Illima.  The Black Tower is not there but
an astrological reading indicates it is in the Chaos Mountains on
Jalmaria.

Get to Jalmaria.  Find PJ in a village near the mountains, having
managed to escape the tower earlier.  We catch him during his wedding
feast and he annouces his discusion to settle.  After getting his
signature on the release form, we leave the next morning.

Fly for a while before walking into the Black Tower.  Nobody pays too
much attention to use.  Using cunning, we release Anathea and Stark
from their cells without blood shed.  Stark the Stupid had, while
fleeing after their attempt to break out, gouged his face with a large
splinter of wood, so that once he had escaped, the Illimi would not be
able to locate him.

Locate Flamis and head up the tower some more (it is about a mile
high).  We find her been brutally tortured (not that much, really,
unfortunately).  We kill the guards but the torturer gets away
by sinking into the ground.

The three captured are Petit Morted, skin changed into rats and put in
Shoka's potion box.

We then head to the gardens, which are near the palace right at the
top of the tower.  There we find Basilisk, turn to stone and painted
in the most hidious riot of colours.

We are attacked by a fire mage, three knights in Strange Metal armour
and some plebs.  The plebs were easily dispatched but the knights took
down Blitzkrieg and Shoka (by magic, Petit Morting them).  Two knights
were taken down by Morgan and the other captured in a ring of stone.
Then four very large wyvern attacked us, causing the mages to be in
big trouble.  Morgan again fixed the problem and Saydar finished them
off with Necrosis.

Then the resident dragon, Mousie, was seen in the distance, so with a
collection of skin changes, wind walks and earth door, we fled, taking
the important bodies, including Icorone, who was a stone mobile
nearby, with us.

We back to the Guild.  Trade the bodies (two knights and the mage) and
their items for a goodly sum of money and the captured party's items.
The original party had to buy their items back off the Guild in
a complicated exchange.  The party managed to get in the end the following.

* 10 flashbombs.
* 15 grenadoes and a mechanical slinger.
* 110,000 silver pennies for ransom.
* 17 hand and a half swords.
* 7 composite bows.
* 210,000 for exchange of items.
