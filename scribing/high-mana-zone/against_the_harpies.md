Meet by Martin Candlestone at the Guild.  He tells us the
following.


* Golden Hill found by goblins and orcs.
* Sword at Golden Hill slays creatures of the Air.
* Metal smiths have gone missing.
* Harpies killing creatures of the Earth.
* Black horn should be his sword.  It is problably broken since
it was to keep people away from the hill.  It is a unicorn's horn 
and gives immunity to poison.
* Burning pine needles before entering a forest helps keep
bad creatures away and attracts good creatures.
* If you pull a face and the wind changes, then your face
is stuck in that position for a time.

Duke has offered 15,000 silver pennies per spell casting harpy.
Martin gives us one items to help with the mission.

## February 2, 1996 AP

After traveling to Candlestone farm, staying at Farmer Brown's farm
the previous night, we go to Gugnir's Hope.  At the crossroads
we find three dead bodies (recently deceeded).

* Badger (Earth Mage)
* Ranger
* Mage

Killed by harpies for trespassing.  Attacked by goblins on wolves and
spied upon by harpies.

In Gugnir's Hope we hear of a group of seven humans and one hobbit
with lots of mining equipment on a wagon heading for Amba.  They had
a stolen trade letter worth 5000 silver pennies and wielded maces.
They had enough equipment for 30 people (of a small stature).  Also
passing of coins that turned from gold to silver.

Go on to Amba.  Talk to the inn keeper who says one group of miners and
a group of four hobbits are looking for the other group (known to
have been in Gugnir's Hope).  Because we did not go by the road
to Amba, we missed them.

Margaret (the muffin lady) wants a pair of large shoes to give to
the brownies to give to the orge so the orge will standout and
not frighten her when he leaps out of bushes.

The location of Faldo and Gross is unknown, persumed MIA.  Search for
place of death of Garioth but don't find it.

During the night we are attacked by at least five harpies and an earth
elemental.  Father Rowan and Athelston killed and their bodies taken.
In return we killed one harpy.  Afterwards we head back to the Guild.

The status of the harpies known at the time.

* Mind (live)
* E \& E (live, has quickness)
* Celestial (live, has blackfire)
* Earth (live)
* Necro (live)
* Wiccan (stone, has investment, Angela)
* Fire (stone)
* Air (stone)

Later get note from harpies.

Fly to Amba and then travel up the river to Catherine's place.  On the
way find coat of either Faldo or Gross in a tree.  On the hill is a
very large chalk carving of two gargoyles.  At Catherine's we
see lots of anti-flying traps.

We talk to Catherine and find out about some of her leaches.

Black
: Neutralise poison

Green
: Stop amnesia

Blue
: Help against begin stunned

Blue &amp; purple
: Help reduce bleeding

Orange
: Keeps other leaches alive (and reduces the effectiveness of some healing)

Red
: Help resist charm

Green &amp; black
: Looks like a hideous creature to mental abilities (telepathy, ESP, etc)

Red &amp; green
: Cat sight

Clemintine turns up with slash, a water elemental.  Head up river to
the Golden Hill.  In the centre of the Golden Hill is a lake guarded
by Naga.  Pierre talks to the Naga and we are able to borrow the sword
(hand &amp; a half sword).

Take several hours to go up the river.  Bart asks why it takes so long
and Clemintine time says she has a green crystal.  The crystal kills
Necromancers instantly if they touch it.  It also slows down time in
an area around it so things take a lot longer (compared with outside
its sphere of influence).  Bury crytal and head back to Catherine's.

Catherine tells us that Buzzard Rock is six miles west from her place
and the harpies live on the northern hill.  Ernie the basilisk, a pet
of Faldo and Gross's, lives around the base of the hills.

We fly to Buzzard Rock and circle it from the east.  We manage of free
some people who had been turned to stone and attempted to storm the
hill.  The harpies attacked us and Pierre was killed in the fight.  We
managed to two harpies but one was taken away by an earth elemental.
After some setbacks Naden and myself managed to force the harpies to
retreat and flee.

Athelston was found alive (having been resurrected) but Father
Rowan had lost his head, hands and feet.  Buzzard Rock was then
searched and all valuables removed to a safer place.

We know atleast seven (possibly eight) harpies and a large group of
gargoyles fleed Buzzard Rock and were last seen flying south.  The
where abouts of Ernie is unknown, along with Faldo and Gross.

## February 7, 1996 AP

Buzzard Rock finally cleared and all the stoned people freed.

The Lord of the Manor at Amba is Sir Cathal Dezala.  A Guild party
had been in the area earlier but no notes of the adventure found.

Meet the Dark Mage, who is actually a solar celestial, but lives
in the Dark Forest.  Tell the party the following.

* Harpies.
* A hermit who is female Wiccan, in the bog (Catherine).
* Goblins.
* A friendly ghost called Withan who looks after lost travellers
and hunters.
* A haunted tower in the roughlands.
* A hermit called martin on the other side of the roughlands.
Martin knows the goblins who know about the tower.
* The witch (the hermit in the bog) is friends with the goblins
and Swithan.

## January 4, 1994 AP

Party travels to Amba and that night Garioth is charmed by a nixie
in the river (Clemintine) and is eaten by a troll.

Party find two gargoyles (Faldo and Gross) who have had their wings
cut off by the harpies at Buzzard Rock.  Tells of the party of
Ernie (but only as a description).  Faldo and Gross lead the
party to Catherine.

She wants the party to rescue the spirit of the river from Demon Rock
where the goblins worship something called the ``Old One.''  The
singing (in the river) is the voice of the river.

Party heads off the Demon Rock but cannot reach the top.  Party
prepare for an assult on the Rock in the morning since the Old One is
not active during the day.

## January 6, 1994 AP

It all goes wrong and Clemintine, PJ and Methuselah are killed
by the troll (a rock troll, as it happens).  Find Garioth's
body but it is irresurrectable.

## January 9, 1994 AP

Methuselah, PJ and Clementine fly back to Demon Rock to join up with
the rest of the party.  They find a magical sword blade in an anvil
and the hilt is somewhere else along with most of the party's gear.
The party digs itself out of the pit it is in (on top of Demon Rock is
a large well which are party went down).  They release Clementine (a
nixie).

The party is attacked by harpies that night but flees to Catherine's
place with the help of Clemintine.

## January 10, 1994 AP

Head back to Amba.  Bluewind (a bird) is a friend of Rippon the Muffin
Monster.  Clementine (the nixie) wants party to deal with Longtooth
the giant beaver, who is building a dam because the harpies told
him to.

The trout is at the base of the waterfall which comes out of a cave.
Clementine turns into a big brown bear.  Roofdweller for a ruined area
(where ever that is) is dead.  Beavers can't cast magic.  Necro living
under the tower (in the middle of the high mana area?).

Bandits (including Simon and Orson) are taking bodies for the
necromancer.  Lots of bandits (Oliver, Matthrew, Carlos, Sly, Roberto,
Robin, Dan and Ritchie). Some were in league with the necro.

Harpies angry with party because in league with the gargoyles (Faldo
and Gross).

Clementine turns into the troll.  Party try to trap and kill the
troll.  Kill troll and take Faldo and Gross to the Guild and get
them fixed up.

Later go the tower and are attacked by the harpies and severely
beaten up.
