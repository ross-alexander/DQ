# Diary

## February 1, 1995 AP

We flew up the Meg's place, next to Robin's castle on the southern
border of Ranke (see Evil Below, or Next Door to Hell).  The raven
told us that Meg was asleep so we camped down in the forest.

## February 3, 1995 AP

Spend the previous day passing time.  During the afternoon Scratch
attempts to burgle Meg's and comes back a real mess.  He comes back
with three wands and 18 potions, 13 or which are magical.

* Three transformation potions (sex change)
* Two restoratives
* Two Self Immolations potions
* Potion of protection from cold
* Potion of SP
* Potion of Gaseous form
* Potion of Diminution
* Potion of Mammal control (non sentient only)
* Potion of Polymorph self
* A ward with eight charges of Rank 17 Resistance to Light
* A ward with eight charges of Rank 20 Fireball
* A ward with four charges of Rank 12 Increase gravity

The Storm Giant King arrives that night on the top of the knoll, in a
storm.  While getting close to him through a circle of lightning
Damien gets blasted and almost dies of heart failure.

Somehow he manages to misdirected during the trip and we end up at a
dolment up in the snows somewhere.  The place is an Earth Place of
Power.

## February 4, 1995 AP

While the King was casting the ritual Shoka and Scratch go off to find
some mistletoe, since mine got destroyed.  On their return they were
attacked by four Yeth Hounds and a pack of wolves.  We fight them off
and the ritual succeeds.

From the stone circle at the southern end of the forest we travel on
the Cloud Dragon boat to the King's keep.  We sleep for a while, only
disturbed by Ughbash and Damien playing murder in dark for a while.

After noon we meet the King and he says that the woman were taken
about nine months ago and a couple of them were pregnant, but the
woman and those at the castle were the last of the race.  He says that
the culprit could have been a white dragon, or that a dragon was
involved.

If it was the dragon then the giants cannot go because of a prophesy
and it is probably an enchanter.  The dragon lives in a palace about
500 to 600 miles north of where we were but the King could get us to
within two days walk to it.  The palace itself is in a valley but not
underground, according to the winds, but their movement is restricted
within the area so the King could not tell us any details of its
construction.

The King also gives us various invested items to help us.

* Weapon of flames invested (12 charges)
* Three Lightning bolt investeds (10 charges each)
* Two Windwalking investeds (10 charges each)
* Ten Vapour breathing potions
* E &amp E general counterspell invested (10 charges)
* Ray of cold invested (10 charges)
* Resist cold invested (10 charges)
* Gaseous form invested (10 charges)
* Bottle containing air spirit
* Three Trollskin invested (6 charges each)
* Smoking magma invested (6 charges)
* Wall of iron invested (6 charges)
* Healing burns invested (7 charges)
* Extinguish fire invested (2 charges)
* A potion of Fire proofing each
* Seven Rank 7 Protection from magical fire potions
* One Rank 14 Protection from magical fire potion
* Five Waters of strength

The cloud dragon flies us back to the stone circle and from there we
were transported to another circle, which was in a volcanically active
valley.  The valley was full of geysers and mud pools.  We travel
north, heading up the valley.

## February 7, 1995 AP

About three hours after dawn we are attacked by four frost giants
riding wooly mammoths.  We manage to kill three of them, the other one
fleeing north.  Ughbash becamed Death Cursed when he killed their
shaman.  The loot consisted of the following items:

Fire ring
: Ring of fire resistance plus other unknown magics.

Ring of telekenesis
: 18 charges of Rank 20 Telekenesis.  Each
charge can lift 400 lb for 210 seconds with 100&percnt chance.  In
addition, triggered charges are stackable, increasing the amount of
weight able to be lifted.

Ring of warmth
: Regenerate cold damage and protection from
cold.  -6 of all cold damage and +10 magic resistance against cold
magics.

Giant arrow
: Shot it up and in will land in the direction you
want to go (Zen Navigation Device).

Horn of Valhala
: Summongs heros aligned to good.

Acorns
: Will automatically grow an oak tree when planted.

Large round shield
: Adds +20 to defense verses missiles but will
attract all missile fire.

Giant mace
: Shaped Weapon of Flames.

Scroll
: Banishment.

Half the party flies north after the last giant.  From the giant they
learn the palace is up on the glacier surrounded by a maze.  The Boss
is about 8' to 9' tall and not human and probably related to a dragon.

## February 8, 1995 AP

We travel for a day on the captured mammoth.

## February 9, 1995 AP

We travel up to the face of the glacier.  It is about 200' tall with a
cave in it.  Inside the cave is an ice worm 30' in diameter.  Ughbash
Earthdoor's the party out except Eric, who flies off as an eagle, and
Damien, who gets sucked up towards the palace when he Windwalked away.

From a distance of five miles south of the glacier we climb the valley
wall and head north.  We decide to Windwalk to the edge of the maze
and lose Scratch and Vycarn in the process.  After a traitorous
journey we make it to the maze around midday.

We make it about an hour into the maze when we are ambushed by orcs,
orges and greater trolls.  They Windwalk us and we end up in a giant
bottle where we are slept.

## February 10, 1995 AP

We meet the boss in the throne room.  He is 9' tall reptillian
humanoid called Armageddon.  While talking to us he completely blanks
out for half a minute.  We are condemed to the arena.

Later that day we defeat six orcs and an orge twin.  Ughbash names us
`Grim Death' for our team name.

## February 11, 1995 AP

We fight a troll Fire Mage called Bog, riding a wooly rhino called
Spike.  After we defeat both Tempest cuts Spike's horn off so we name
it Stumpy.

## February 12, 1995 AP

In the morning Ughbash managed to capture an female elf caleld Rexena
in his beer trap.  She says that many of the woman want out since the
boss started going all strange, about a year back.  She says she can
help us find out way around and will show us to the Master's quarters.

The party pleads injury to get out of the arena for the day.  Myself,
Shoka, Tempest and Vycarn spend a little while in the garden outside
our wing.  Later, while the rest of the party spend the time at the
arena, myself, Damien, Ughbash and Eric attempt to enter the Master's
quarters.

The first garden had northern climate plants, the second
mediterrainian plants and the third, next to the Master's wing, hot,
off plane flora and forna.  We avoided the fire lizards, hyrda and
giant scorpions and tunnel back into the building.  Ughbash just
missed being turned to stone by a passing medussa.

We make it into a storeroom filled with assorted junk.  The Master's
wing consists of a long corridor, with doors leading to the throne
room and the garden at each end respectively.

We make it down as far as the library, which has a petrification curse
on it, before getting spotted.  Eric, myself and Damien all get slept
but Ughbash managed to make it back all the way through the gardens to
our wing before getting captured.

## February 13, 1995 AP

Myself, Eric and Damien wake up about two hours after noon.  Rumours
have it we are to be put to the worm.  Ughbash managed to capture
Rexena again (much to her disgust).  She says about a year ago the
boss had a staff made of ice which he carried around continually for
about three weeks before it disappeared.

We follow Rexena up into the roof area and make out way to the north
wing.  We make our down into a store room, Vycarn losing a lot of skin
in the process.

We enter the north wing into a storeroom.  After subduing a guard we
looted the armoury.  We then entered the alchemy lab while Ughbash
tried to chop his way into the Master's quarters.  A combat ensued,
which ended with the possesion being killed and the drake unconscious.
We declare a truce with the chamberlain and retire to our rooms.

## February 14, 1995 AP

We talk to the drake and get some more items which he did not recognise.

* Two scrolls
* Three potions
* One amutlet
* One broach

## February 20, 1995 AP

We meet again with the drake and we given a boon.

## February 26, 1995 AP

The Storm Giant King arrives and we leave.

## March 3, 1995 AP

Return to Seagate.
