# Diary of Events

## July 1, 1996 AP

Riptide, a Water mage and bargee on the Sweet Water, wants a party to
investigate the origins of the Big Juju, a giant kraken, which lives
under Ildrisholm.

An earlier party meet the Juju, and it wanted them to enter the city
within Ildrisholm, via a portal, and get some stuff.  The party
fled rather than do it.

## July 3, 1996 AP

Camp at the ford after two days travelling upstream.  We were attacked
by the troll, which was driven off.  Sabastian then loots the troll's
cave, getting a giant mace and eight healing potions (Waters of
Healing).  The troll had a conch shell forced on its head.  This
turned out to be a control device used by the big Juju.

## July 5, 1996 AP

Riptide summons some fossigrim, since he knows there was atleast one
fossigrim working for the Juju.  They tell us the following information.

> He (the Juju) sent two clay golems into the city but they did not
> come back.  He arrived in the cave about two years ago.  The goblins
> brought him from somewhere south, the a guild party killed
> most the them later.  When the goblins brought him, it was
> in a cart full of treasure.  Came originally from Snake Island,
> somewhere near a large swamp, in the vicinity of the Five Sisters.
> He found part of The Book while living near Snake Island.

> The Juju controls the troll and sends it looking for stuff.  Hasn't seen
> the bush but has the berries (somehow helps with the golems).  Could
> be the walking bush, which he has the secret of.

> The Juju thinks all the Book is wet.  He has a whole lot of dragon's teeth,
> which if planted, create dragon warriors.  With them he will conquer
> the world and create a great empire.

We sow dissention and confusion into the fossigrim and convince them to 
get us a dragon's tooth.

## July 6, 1996 AP

Fossigrim (both) come back with a tooth and wants the party to plant it
in the hill where the party has previously said will grow dragon
warriors.  Fly off with one fossigrim to a hill north of the
same campsite.  In the distance to the north we are shadowed
for a while by a humanoid on shadow wings.

We check that this hill is not going to grow a dragon warrior and then
settle down.  Later, Sabastian finds a goat and puts it on the top of
the hill, making it look as if it grew there.  We then wake up the
fossigrim, who chases after the goat as it flees to the north, having
been instructed to do so.  Sabastian keeps the dragon's tooth.

## July 7, 1996 AP

Fly off and talk to the Geode, the orge earth mage, for a while.  Go
on and talk to the goblins.  Sabastian and I spend the next four
days building kiln and still for them.  We talk to the Butcher, the
leader of the goblins.

> Juju is a water mage.  He killed the nixie which was there and
> consumed her power.  Has ivory chess set.  Planted Slug in 
> the graveyard.  Juju comes from Snake Island.

## July 12, 1996 AP

Fly off to the cloisters.  Brother Zephar tells us there could be
a passage from the back of the cloisters into the city and the
gargoyles are on an eastern variety.

Fly off and collect the horses.  Leave for Seagate.

## July 15, 1996 AP

Get back to Seagate with the loot.

* Eight Rank 8 Waters of Healing.
* Some fungus juice.
* Six Rank 5 Waters of Strength.
* Giant mace.

## July 18, 1996 AP

After collecting some horses and a cart, leave for Brastor.

## July 23, 1996 AP

Attacked by brigands.  Out of 17 in their gang, 14 attacked us.  We killed eight
and captured one.  Zedekias got his throat slit by bandit during the encounter.
Wheb flies back to the Guild with Zed's body.

## July 26, 1996 AP

Return to the Guild with loot.  Nothing of great interest, so sell it and
party pays for Zed's resurrection.
