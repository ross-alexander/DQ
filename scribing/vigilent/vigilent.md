## Frost 15, 797 WK

Arrive at Somnia. Rich, pretentious and all very nice.

Talk to Maleius, and are told that the astrologers can see a "silvery
white on the rim of the moon." They believe it could be structures of
some kind, possibly a city of sorts, or a circle. They also think the
moon's course has been altered.

Recent astrological readings indicate that "The Inquisition will wane
with the moon."

standing stones in the forest which is a place of power. Get Shoka and
some earth elementals to right the stones.

## Frost 23, 797 WK

Arrive in Roris, a flat and boring place with 30,000 $\approx$ 50,000
people which is near the river. Talk to Maleius. He says the astrologers
had found out the shift in the moon will cause a lunar eclipse to center
over Lunar City at the next full moon.

## Frost 24, 797 WK

Travel to Nectaris through the Guild of Transport and Travel. Then
travel towards the mountains. Help a farmer during the afternoon and
evening.

## Frost 25, 797 WK

I collect Justin and Spike from Nectaris. Travel up the river into the
mountains. Engleton flies off and finds the entrance to the six-eyed
seer's tunnels. Travel down the tunnels for a long while.

We reach the six-eyed seer and he tells us the following:

-   Seven control the Guild of Transport and Travel.
-   We can get to the moon via the Dreamlands.
-   The darkness is a group of powerful offplaner creatures trying to
    invade. Creatures interplaner parasites.
-   Should find out what the emperors are named after.
-   We should recruit Redfern, who is currently residing at the temple
    of death.
-   Wants half a ton of Sorbet.

We head out to the Sirgalis mountains. Come out up a mountain and it is
freezing cold.

## Frost 26, 797 WK

Travel back down the tunnel and up to Orientale. The tunnel terminates
about 50 miles north of Orientale. Spend night outside Orientale.

## Frost 27, 797 WK

Meet Logan and go to meet Leone (daughter of Maynan).

Leone tells us the following.

-   Cat or Rat clan have are Celestial mages.
-   Dark lords still operating in the vicinity.

    wondering about the city.

:   Enchanter.

Heron
:   Namer.

## Frost 28, 797 WK

Travel for the day.

## Frost 29, 797 WK

Travel up to the Temple of Death. Talk to Redfern. Travel on to the
Temple of War. The Temple of War is a large training ground. People
there don't normally die or age, but spend all their time training.
Those at the temple are mostly insane and rat-bitingly mad. The keeper
of the temple, Bellum, said that should a war come about then he was
willing to release people to fight, but otherwise it would be a very bad
idea to let them loose.

There we fight ourselves in mortal combat. Those that did gained one
rank in any one weapon.

Afterwards we fly on to the Temple of Fate. The temple was in a ravine
with big columnates, and we enter into a large atrium. Fate is served by
three women of different ages.

Inside is a large loom with many threads hanging from the ceiling. There
we have able to change our past history in some way, and some choose a
slightly different fate.

We are told that a golden dragon called Homopholous, who aided the first
emperor, has been around atleast 1000 years, and lives in the Derook
mountains.

Later we fly on the Temple of Luck. The Temple is a small shrine in a
beautiful mountain glade. The glade was wooded and full of small
animals, like it was summer there. From the fount in the shrine each
takes a bottle of liquid.

## Frost 30, 797 WK

We leave the Temple of Luck and fly south, also leaving Redfern. Redfern
gives us Death's blessing, enabling us to avoid our first death. Reach
Orientale in evening. Get large block of ice and put it in Logan's room.

## Snow 1, 797 WK

Portal back to Lunar and then on to Imbrium. Imbrium is a beatiful place
with lots of tall spires and magnificent buildings.

We buy shadowwings from the College of Celestial magics and fly around
the coast and up the river. Close to the head of the river we land.
After walking a short distance up the river a ferry arrives, polled up a
greater undead blood construct. After paying two coppers each we cross
the river and head up this really wield mountain.

After traveling into the mountain a little way, enter a room with one
end covered by a curtain. Hyperion says he is willing to help, providing
later we hunt down some renegate vampires living in the area.

Hyperion can replace your blood if you want. We get some blood charms
from him. The charms do the following things.

Counterspells
:   A counterspell can be invested into the charm. This can be triggered
    at anytime as if it were a normal invested counterspell. The
    duration of the effect is 15 minutes.

Magic resistance
:   When triggered, adds +20 to the wearer's magic resistance for two
    pulses, made of golden and silver ying-yang and bound earth.

Might blow
:   When triggered, adds +20 to strike chances and any blow will do
    maximum damage, lasting for two pulses, made from steel and quartz.

Spell boost
:   When triggered, adds +20 to cast chances and any spell will do
    maximum damage, lasting for two pulses, made from silver and a small
    pearl.

Protection from fear
:   When triggered, adds +40 to any willpower check again fear, for two
    pulses.

Protection from poison
:   If worn, will completely negate the first poison.

Black eye
:   Hyperion can replace an eye with a piece of obsidion, enabling the
    wearer to see invisible.

We fly back down to Imbrium over the mountains, and then portal back to
Lunar. When we get there we are met by an official of the Emperor, who
asks us to see the emperor.

We talk to the emperor, who asks us what we are about to do. We had
heard from Malieus earlier that the Guild of Artifices had formed a plan
to strap two large methane boosters onto a flying ship, and were
planning a direct assault on the moon.

The emperor also tells us the Guild has developed a doomsday weapon, and
that we can use on (of two that they have). We are also offered
assistance.

From the Emperor (direct and otherwise) are the following items.

Giant sized heavy plate
:   Rank 8 (Vycharn).

Normal heavy plate
:   Rank 8 (Shoka).

Gladiator plate
:   Lots sharp pointy bits and razor edges (Shoka).

Silver plate
:   Wearer does not take damage from normal weapons (Callas).

Paper armour
:   Amour very light and almost indestructable. Wearer has large
    protection from piercing weapons, some from slashing weapons and
    very little from crushing weapons (Logan).

Boots of Fear
:   Causes people in close vicinity fear (Saydar).

Gloves of Lightning
:   Wearer can rain lightning from their fingertips (Blitzkrieg).

Boots of death
:   If the wearer stands on somebody, then they may instantly die
    (Engleton).

Giant spear
:   Rank 10 (Vycharn).

Vapour Breathing
:   Rank 1, 7 × 10 charges.

Shadow Walking
:   Rank 10, 5 potions.

Hellfire
:   Rank 10, 2 × 6 charges.

Dragonflames
:   Rank 10, 2 × 6 charges.

We then talk to the head of the Guild of Astrologers, who tells us the
following.

> Beware the darkest of powers,  
> Beware the darkest of mages,  
> Beware the darkness of powers,  
> Dont't trend in the shadows.

> Do not go to Z'ha'dum, for will never return.

He also tells us the following.

-   In the dreamlands, you must go there for a reason.
-   All dragons between 500--2000 years old.

From Maleius we get the following.

-   Shrived potion of Rank 16 Light.
-   Shrived potion of Rank 6 Light.

From the Guild of Alchemists and Artificers we get the following.

-   Rank 8 poison antidote ($\times$ 10).
-   One doomsday weapon.

## Snow 2, 797 WK

Travel to Six-eyed Seer. Made sorbet. Travel onward, having been told
not to spend more than 13 weeks in the dreamlands and we should meet him
in Selaphais.

# The Dreamlands

## Day 1

Reach large room with two guards who check us out, then travel down 777
stairs to come out of a huge oak tree in a forest.

## Day 3

Reach the river and make a raft. Sail down the river to Thran. Thran has
100' high alabaster walls, with 100 gates and 200 towers. At the gate
each of us have to tell three stories of unbelievable strangeness.

## Day 6

Reach Hlanath by boat from Thran. Hlanath is a huge seaport, with
granite walls and steeply roofed houses with plastered gables. Visit the
Tower of Sorceries.

## Day 15

Reach Celephais, one of the greatest trading cities of the Dreamlands.
City made of blue marble with lots of bronze status and silver
minirettes at the top of the buildings.

Go to the Palace of Seventy Delights were we are met by the Six-eyed
Seer, who teachs us to Temperal Fugue. He also tells us that we have to
find a tunnel from the Dreamland moon to the real moon, and that the
ghouls in the Underworld should know. Three enterances to the Underworld
he knows about are the following.

-   A stone slab in the Enchanted wood.
-   Passways in Mount Naganak (to the south).
-   The ruins of Sakumand (in the north).

## Day 16

Take a boat to Baharna on Orieb in the south seas.

## Day 37

Reach Baharna, a huge city made of porphyry, with a large canel through
it from lake Yack. We are told not to go high up on Mount Nagranak, or
on the southern side, or stay in the ruins as its base.

## Day 41

Climb mountain after traveling four days. After talking to brave lava
gather, told ruins are cursed and all who go there do not return.

Near the top of the mountain on the southern side is a huge face carved
into a cliff. We enter a tunnel above the face where we a jumped by
Dreamlands nightguants, long lived animals which are human-like in shape
except they have wings. They are rubbery in body and have a slimey touch
and tickled their victims into incapacity.

All the party except Shoka are overcome and are flown down the tunnel,
over a vast rocky plane and dropped of in vast plane of bones. Shoka
follows the party by wind walking. We camp on the bones by are disturbed
by huge worm, called a Doul, so we flee to the north on wings. About
three hours of flying (120 miles) we reach a mountain range where we
land and are met by two ghouls. There we camp for eight hours.

## Day 43

After travelling for two days, meet a ghoul called Scribbler who had
been to the moon. On the moon are big pale toad like creatures with
tenticles. Scribbler called them moon beasts. They can change size,
according to Scribbler.

The moon beasts fly black galleons to and from the moon and have a base
in the ruins of Sakumand.

To exit to the surface the party has to travel to the Tower of Koth
which is between the Gug city and the Vaults of Zin (occupied to
Zhonsts).

## Day 44

Travel to the Tower of Koth. Attacked by Gugs and escape up the tower.
At top of tower is a stone trapdoor withthe glyph of Koth on it. The
Gugs are afraid of the glyth.

Exit to the Enchanted Forest and travel south for three days.

## Day 48

Reach Ulthur, and archtypical feudal city with cobbled streets and a
high hill in the centre. On top of the temple is a temple with a granite
tower covered with ivy. Everywhere are cats.

That evening the cats talk to us and they agree to take us to the moon
in return for helping them with their war with the Zooks.

The cats then take us to the Keeper of Dreams who offers us an item of
our dreams.

## Day 49

Spend six weeks here training. The last evening here, the cats pick us
up (about 100 per person). They then run and run and run and finally run
up a mountain and jump off it.

# Dreamlands moon

The cats drop us of near close to where the light and dark sides meet.
Nearby is a large crater, about 10 miles across, and at the bottom is a
city, itself five miles across.

We scout out the city and while there are attacked by five moon beasts
and their minions. We kill three of them while two flee into inky black
pools of oil. In centre of city is a black plinth with the names of the
72 named demons written on it. Just reading a name from the plinth would
summon the demon. The whole city looks like some summoning area.

Decide to head to the tunnels of the moon beasts, who have ruby mines on
the Dark side of the Moon. While travelling party accidentily calls
Murmur. Murmur says the bad guys are the Power of Darkness and are
Darkness Incarnate.

Head back to the city and poke about for a while. Decide to set the
doomsday weapon. Saydar thoughtfully protects the bomb with a bone
construction.

The party then sets the bomb's timer and then flees the area on Shadow
wings. A dark Titan (here after refered to a Laughing Boy) turns up and
starts carving away the bone construction with a couple of Dark Spheres.
Saydar calls down some sunlight from our bunker at the rim of the
crater. The titan teleports out of the center and the party flees the
bunker on wings.

The titan re-appears half a minute later at the rim while the party are
fleeing and then the bomb goes off. The explosion completely destroys
the city and reaches just beyond the rim of the crater. Laughing Boy
persumed to have escaped.

We land and banish ourselves back to the real moon.

# The real moon

## Snow 2, 797 WK

Rest for three days while earth elements dig tunnel from hideout in
canyon to under the city.

## Snow 5, 797 WK

Reach city and look around. Identical to city in Dreamlands except in
central piazza the central dome now has doors. Party spends two days
debating.

## Snow 7, 797 WK

Party finally decides to poke around and sends an earth element into the
dome. Inside is a vast orrery, which the party starts to dismantle. The
sun of the orrery is a light sphere, which we need to destroy the plinth
here on the real moon.

With the orrery stopped, the shadows cast by the planets thicken and
lots of bad guys are turning up. A quick and brutal combat ensues, with
Laughing Boy making an appearance. The bad guys are finally put down and
Laughing Boy, swearing the a titan, disappears off.

Shoka, Blitzkrieg, Saydar and Vychan put into Logan's room with Callas,
Engleton, Logan and an earth elemental staying to destroy the orrery.

After an one and a half Laughing Boy turns up with with two dark
spheres. Logan recalls himself, Callas distracts the titan for an
action, then recalls herself, and Engleton throws the light sphere into
one of the dark sphere before he himself spoke his word of recall.

# Back in Lunar

We spend the rest of winter in Lunar, first in Lunar City and then in
Tycho. Much wining and dining was done, and may deals made. The party
eventually portalled back to Seagate for the Guild Meeting.
