# Notes of what happened

After being press ganged by the Guild into a rescue mission while
drinking in the pub after training we portalled up to Norham. We walked
through some woods for a couple of hours to reach the dell. On the way
we met a couple of cats working for Ulric the Sorcerer.

After climbing over the metal fence, which kept the Undead in, we
spent a while finding the mound, killing a couple of zombies on the
way. At the mound we tunnelling in from the back, taking the wight and
the two nightgaunts by surprise. Lath lightning bolted them a couple
of times, Tussock attempted to leap into close with the wight and got
kicked out but then dealt savage damage to it from behind and Morgan
pounded it with a flaming mace.

It was all over in half a minute. After that we searched the area around
the dell, killing the zombied previous party and finding a very evil
glaive, which the Guild since purchased and put in a safe vault. We
hauled the dead zombies back to Norham as levitated balloons on a rope
and then returned to the Guild. We also collected five skulls, which
chatter if anybody is in 30' of them.
