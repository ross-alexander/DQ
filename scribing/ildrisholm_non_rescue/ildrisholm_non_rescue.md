Here about trouble from Sabastian, who received a message via Brother
Zephar through Windspeak. With Sabastian is Zedikias. Sabastian find
Pierre and Vapour.

Party flies to the Cloisters on wings and finds that Kazak and Tulip
were there and have now left again. We fly to graveyard and investigate
it. The graveyard in built on a hill. At the top of the hill and a black
tree and hanging from it is a iron gibbet cage. The tree is a "Tree of
Evil" and the cage life drains anybody who touches it.

Kharga's badly burnt body is found in the cage and with care is removed
and wrapped in a tarp. We fly back to the Cloisters.

Back at the Cloisters we find Kazak and Tulip have returned and gone to
sleep. Some what later Uzi turns up, having spent two weeks trapped in
the rune portal.

After waiting until about two hours after midnight, the party flew off
to the graveyard to confront the Slug (an Undead Goblin necromancer who
lives in the graveyard). At the edge of the graveyard we were met by the
revenant of Kharga, who asked us to put all his remaining worldly
possession into a bounty to kill the Slug and Saracen.

Close to the edge of the graveyard we saw the Slug (some 100 yards away)
and two nightguants, that of Saracen and one other. Jedburgh attempted
to charge them but before he could reach them they had disappeared into
the ground.

The party then fly to Castlerock and find reasonably fresh elven blood
at the base of the rock. We then head off to where we believe a wyvern
lives.

Near the top of the hill (on which live the wyvern) we discover that the
top part is invisible. At the top of the hill is a outcrop. Sabastian
climbs up the outcrop and into the wyvern's cave. There he finds two
wyverns and some fresh elf bones. The party then decided the wyvern were
a menance and prompted slaughtered them.

In the mess of bones and wyvern shit we found the following items:

-   Tonanda's bikini ring
-   The Binder in the Black Tower's magical device
-   A golden censure

We also got two wyvern skins.

After spending the day skinning the wyverns we headed back to the
Cloisters and then back to the Guild.
