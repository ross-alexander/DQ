# Diary

## 1/01/803 WK

I run into Alsom, a well known alchemist of Seagate, who ask if I can
get together a small party to collect a flower from a desert oasis.

## 2/01/803 WK

Meet Alsom in the morning and sort out paper work at the Guild before
leaving for Bale on Alsom\'s magic carpet.

## 3/1/803 WK

Arrival in Bale. Hired camels for 6sp / day. Head off the Elbar Oasis in
the afternoon. That evening attacked by plant golem but defeat it.

## 8/1/803 WK

Meet Beloc at oasis and escorted to Malac.

## 21/1/803 WK

Reach Malac\'s tribe, the Kaltap, and talk to the chief, Malac\'s
brother. The chief is a bit of an old windbag. Told that the well found
by a previous party has dried up and we are asked to find out why.

## 3/2/803 WK

Reach well in the evening.

## 4/2/803 WK

Go down well. Find at bottom there is a small crawlway with runs about
20 feet to a corridor. The corridor is about 10 feet to a door and then
another 70 feet to a largish room. Along the center of the corridor is a
mostly dry gutter. The room contains a circular stone plinth with five
arabic symbols carved onto the surface. A spring feed stream coming from
the far end of the room had been blocked forcing the water to flow
around and into the plinth, activating the magic. A sluce gate
controlled the flow of water. We are attacked by five small feather
animates, three of which join together to form a large animate, but they
are all destroyed. Uzi smashed the sluce gate beyond repair while I
investigated the plinth. When it was working it would act as a transport
gate to somewhere else in the desert. The room had an additional exit to
the surface but the actual exit was hidden within a dune. We locate the
doorway but do not uncover it.

## 12/02/803 WK

We return back to the camp. Malac tells us the chief was said we cannot
go to the oasis as that time and reminds us that a previous party had
already got the same flower from the oasis previously.

## 21/2/803 WK

I loose Uzi and Tulip in desert storm. After waiting for three days I
travel with our guild back to Bale.

## 29/2/803 WK

Travel back to Alusia after night sky said they were no longer on the
desert plane.
